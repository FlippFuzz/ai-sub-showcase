待ち覚えてない 覚えてない 鈍いね

使い難い 記憶の監獄で

だから私の理由になったよ
So, it became my reason.

...I feel myself falling...

200
00:15:19,057 --> 00:15:23,557
...into complete deafening darkness.

201
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:27,057
A blanket of monochrome solitude...

202
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:30,057
there is no one.

203
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,057
Alone.

204
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:34,857
you're not alone

205
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:36,257
I'm alone

The time has come

214
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:08,057
DARK ARIA <LV2>

215
00:16:04,557 --> 00:16:09,557
To pack away all the joys

216
00:16:12,657 --> 00:16:15,557
You don't want to hear my apology

217
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,457
Get it off my chest, I would do my best

218
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:20,657
I know what you feel

219
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:24,457
Similarities we possess

220
00:16:24,757 --> 00:16:28,057
Never will I pass the test

221
00:16:28,457 --> 00:16:30,857
The scene is fading

222
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,557
Can my soul be put to rest?

223
00:16:35,457 --> 00:16:38,257
Death is gonna come for me

224
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:41,657
Be the change I couldn't be

225
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:45,357
Can you find a life that's like fairy tales

226
00:16:45,357 --> 00:16:47,357
Far from this tragedy?

227
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,557
Said you had to wait for me

228
00:16:50,857 --> 00:16:53,357
Feels like an eternity

229
00:16:53,657 --> 00:16:56,557
Please forgive me for my sins

230
00:16:56,757 --> 00:17:00,057
Angels' wings lifting and setting me free

231
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:14,257
Death is gonna come for me

232
00:17:14,257 --> 00:17:17,857
Be the change I couldn't be

233
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:21,457
Can you find a life that's like fairy tales

234
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,457
Far from this tragedy?

235
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:26,557
Said you had to wait for me

236
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:29,357
Feels like an eternity

237
00:17:29,557 --> 00:17:32,457
Please forgive me for my sins

238
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:36,057
Angels' wings lifting and setting me free

239
00:17:36,457 --> 00:17:40,857
The question of my love

240
00:17:41,757 --> 00:17:44,257
Slipping right through

241
00:17:44,257 --> 00:17:45,657
The cracks

242
00:17:45,657 --> 00:17:48,057
And crumbling to dust

243
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:53,357
The question of my love

244
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:56,557
Slipping right through

245
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:58,057
The cracks

246
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,657
And crumbling to dust

247
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:38,057
synchronicity

248
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:57,257
この温もりは
Where is this warmth

249
00:18:57,557 --> 00:19:00,457
どこへ行くの
heading to?

250
00:19:01,257 --> 00:19:04,057
明日になれば
By tomorrow,

251
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:07,457
消えてしまうの
will it vanish?

252
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:11,257
胸の鼓動
If we align

253
00:19:11,457 --> 00:19:14,557
合わせたならば
our heartbeats,

254
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:17,657
同じ深みへ
can we descend

255
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:21,057
降りてゆけるの
to the same depths?

256
00:19:21,557 --> 00:19:23,557
いつも
Always,

257
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:25,357
いつも
always,

258
00:19:25,557 --> 00:19:28,357
側にいるよ
I'm by your side.

259
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:31,557
どんな 遠く
No matter how far

260
00:19:31,857 --> 00:19:36,457
君の心が迷っても
your heart wanders.

261
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:42,557
暗闇の中に二人で漂いながら
As the two of us drift in the darkness,

262
00:19:45,357 --> 00:19:48,857
無邪気な小鳥のように翼を寄せていた
we drew our wings close like innocent birds.

263
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:56,457
寂しい時には笑顔に隠れる君は
When you're lonely, hiding behind a smile,

264
00:19:58,557 --> 00:19:59,857
解けない...
an unsolvable...

265
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,903
凍りの刃
An icy blade

266
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:05,880
この胸をさらして
Baring my chest

267
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,751
抱きしめる
I'll embrace you

268
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:13,622
ずっと
Forever

269
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:22,633
君は一人で
You're all alone

270
00:20:22,633 --> 00:20:26,405
どこへ行くの？
Where are you going?

271
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:29,900
振り返るのが
Is it only because

272
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,159
怖いだけなの？
You're afraid to look back?

273
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:36,630
胸の形も
The shape of your heart

274
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,427
悲しい色も
The color of your sadness

275
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:43,832
本当はきっと
In truth, I'm sure

276
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:47,483
よく似てるのに
They look so much alike

277
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:50,554
いつかきっと
One day, surely

278
00:20:50,554 --> 00:20:53,718
帰る場所を
Our place to return to

279
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:57,326
二人同じ
We both search with

280
00:20:57,326 --> 00:21:00,632
儚さで見つめている
The same fleeting gaze

281
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:07,086
この闇の中で
In the midst of this darkness

282
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:10,581
どんなに離れていても
No matter how far apart we are

283
00:21:10,581 --> 00:21:14,287
心は何より強い
The heart is bound by

284
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:17,656
絆で呼び合って
A bond stronger than anything

285
00:21:17,656 --> 00:21:21,001
淋しい時君は
When you're lonely

286
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:24,396
笑っていてもわかるよ
I can tell even if you're smiling

287
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:27,838
冷たい指を涙で
I want to warm your cold fingers

288
00:21:27,838 --> 00:21:31,612
暖めてあげたい
With my tears

289
00:21:31,612 --> 00:21:35,149
側にいる
I'm by your side

290
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,609
I can see you in my mind

291
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:43,812
You and me

292
00:21:43,812 --> 00:21:46,494
I can feel you in my mind

293
00:21:46,494 --> 00:21:49,101
Be with me and so

294
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:55,803
I can see you in my mind

295
00:21:55,803 --> 00:21:58,283
You and me

296
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,741
I can feel you in my mind

297
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:03,314
Be with me

298
00:22:09,186 --> 00:22:12,633
暗闇の中に
While drifting through

299
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:15,892
二人で漂いながら
The pitch-black darkness

300
00:22:15,892 --> 00:22:19,536
無邪気な小鳥のように
Like innocent little birds

301
00:22:19,536 --> 00:22:22,891
翼を寄せていた
Drawing our wings together

302
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:26,400
淋しい時君は
When you're lonely

303
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,638
笑顔に隠れる君は
And hiding behind a smile

304
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:33,277
解けない凍りの刃
Like an unbreakable icy blade

305
00:22:33,277 --> 00:22:36,921
この胸をさらして
Baring my chest

306
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:40,474
抱きしめる
I'll embrace you

307
00:22:40,474 --> 00:22:43,835
側にいる
I'm by your side

308
00:22:43,835 --> 00:22:47,417
側にいる
I'm by your side

309
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:51,598
ずっと...
Forever...

310
00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:59,099
Have you ever looked through rose colored glasses?

311
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:04,646
A touch of red in our black and grey world...

312
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:08,646
...one of pain and misery...

313
00:24:09,377 --> 00:24:10,121
DROWNING

314
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:11,302
SUFFOCATING

315
00:24:11,302 --> 00:24:12,483
LOATHING

316
00:24:12,483 --> 00:24:13,751
DESPAIR

317
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:24,131
僕らの世界を色眼鏡で見たことある？
Have you ever gazed at our world through rose colored glasses?

318
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:31,131
見てごらんよ きっと気づくでしょう
You should give it a try... For I'm sure you too will realize

319
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:38,313
こんなに素敵な色があったなんて
Has there ever been a more beautiful color?

320
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:42,600
赤く染めよう
Drown everything in Red.

To the spreading ripples

325

波打つ命の底
Bottom of the waving life

326
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:46,447
ざわついた私の心の森を揺さぶる
Shaking the forest of my noisy heart

327
00:25:46,947 --> 00:25:49,481
木枯らしよ
Oh, winter wind

328
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:55,414
今日を堪えて切れるものなら
If I can endure today and cut through it

329
00:25:55,747 --> 00:26:00,247
そのままの私でいさせて
Let me be as I am

330
00:26:00,647 --> 00:26:05,547
誰もがこの森で
Everyone in this forest

331
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:12,414
静かな声を聞いて
Listen to the quiet voice

332

386

一人語りしてもいいですか
Is it okay if I talk to myself?

387
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:36,513
カモメにそっとつぶやいた
I softly whispered to the seagulls

388
00:30:38,743 --> 00:30:43,613
女一途な真心乗せて
Carrying a woman's devoted sincerity

389
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:48,543
北の海風凍てついた
The northern sea breeze froze

390

はぐれ恋散る
A stray love scatters

391

怨み節さえ
Even the grudges

392
00:31:00,913 --> 00:31:05,243
遠いあんたにゃ届かない
Won't reach you, who are far away

393
00:31:05,673 --> 00:31:11,543
佇んで泣き濡れて
Standing still, wet with tears

愛した夜を悔やんでも
Even if I regret the nights I loved you

397
00:31:49,913 --> 00:31:54,973
男勝手な約束ばかり
Only selfish promises from a man

398
00:31:55,343 --> 00:31:59,943
何もかなわず終わります
Everything ends without coming true

399
00:32:00,313 --> 00:32:04,673
波のしぶきにこの身投げたら
If I threw myself into the sea spray

400
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:11,243
怨み節さえ
Even the grudges

401
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:16,343
遠いあんたに愛想尽きて
Fed up with you, who are far away

402
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:22,343

I want to offer to my love

三つ巴の愛としりもせず
Not even knowing it was a three-way love

405
00:33:00,673 --> 00:33:10,543
愛した罪は消えないの
The sin of having loved will not disappear

406
00:33:11,613 --> 00:33:16,943
誰を選んで決められないと
Saying you can't choose who to be with

407
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:21,513
別れ上手な人でした
You were someone good at saying goodbye

408

Hey, you took it, didn't you? Bye-bye, now it's your turn

612
00:53:12,691 --> 00:53:15,691
罪はライアー　イネヴァーは　You
The sin is a liar, the invader is you

613
00:53:16,391 --> 00:53:18,991
拝啓ドッペルゲンガー　君は誰　君は誰
Dear Doppelganger, who are you? Who are you?

614
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:21,491
あぁ混濁の末として　僕が誰
Ah, as a result of the confusion, who am I?

615
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:26,691
増すはずの存在の命の椅子は一つだけ
There's only one seat for the life of an
existence that should increase

616
00:53:26,991 --> 00:53:29,691
拝啓ドッペルゲンガー　あれは誰　あれは君
Dear Doppelganger, who is that? That is you

617
00:53:29,691 --> 00:53:32,191
零れ出した一粒が　渇き果てるまで
Until the single drop that spilled out dries up

618
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:33,991
誰もいない　何でもいい
No one is here, anything is fine

619
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:37,691
普通を装う　狂った世界が染め上げてるん　パッパ
Pretending to be normal, the crazy world is staining, pa-pa

620
00:53:51,691 --> 00:53:53,191
一人ずつ続き　響く五芒星の連鎖
Continuing one by one, the echo of the pentagram chain

621
00:54:03,391 --> 00:54:05,591
僕のほうがちゃんと君を生きてやるから
I'll live your life better than you can

622
00:54:05,591 --> 00:54:08,191
君も次の誰かちゃんと救わなくちゃ
So you have to make sure to save the next person too

623
00:54:08,191 --> 00:54:10,691
もう分かってんだろ何をすればいいかさ
You already know what you have to do, right?

624
00:54:10,691 --> 00:54:14,491
遠く誰か僕に奇跡をくれ
Someone far away, give me a miracle

625
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:39,391
拝啓ドッペルゲンガー　君は誰　君は誰
Dear Doppelganger, who are you? Who are you?

626
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:41,991
あぁ混濁の末として　僕が誰
Ah, as a result of the confusion, who am I?

627
00:54:41,991 --> 00:54:46,191
もう止まらない物語　どうもこんにちは君の...
A story that won't stop anymore. Hello, I'm your...

628
00:54:47,191 --> 00:54:49,991
拝啓ドッペルゲンガー　それは誰　それは僕
Dear Doppelganger, who is that? That is me

629
00:54:49,991 --> 00:54:53,491
蝕まれた存在に　世界が気付こうとも
Even if the world notices the eroded existence

630
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:55,391
何もない　痛みもない
There's nothing, no pain

631
00:54:55,391 --> 00:54:58,691
一石の人間が　狂った正解を染め上げるさ
A single human will stain the crazy correct answer

632
00:54:58,691 --> 00:55:01,191
上手くやれよ　オレンパッパ
Do it well, oren-pa-pa

633
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:02,453
上手くやれよ ルンパッパ
Do it well, runpappa.

634
00:55:20,453 --> 00:55:22,653
どうもこんにちは 君の分身です
Hello there. I am your alter ego.

635
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:33,353
Whoa! Thank you so much for watching

636
00:55:33,353 --> 00:55:35,653
my #CHU2BAE Live today!

637
00:55:35,653 --> 00:55:38,353
I can feel myself floating away...

638
00:55:38,353 --> 00:55:41,653
...spiritually, psychologically, and physically.

639
00:55:41,653 --> 00:55:43,753
But...

640
00:55:43,753 --> 00:55:46,153
...it wouldn't be a live without a shill-taro!

641
00:55:46,153 --> 00:55:50,253
I present to you the #CHU2BAE Merch Set!

642
00:55:50,253 --> 00:55:51,653
Ta-da-da-da!

643
00:55:51,653 --> 00:55:55,353
First up, we have an—I can't believe

644
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:57,953
the words are coming out of my mouth—

645
00:55:57,953 --> 00:56:00,153
the official...

646
00:56:00,153 --> 00:56:02,953
...JDONMY T-Shirt!

647
00:56:03,153 --> 00:56:05,253
なんということですかこれは!?
What on earth is this!?

648
00:56:05,253 --> 00:56:08,653
I can't believe it's come to this.

649
00:56:08,653 --> 00:56:11,953
But yes, I've made the official 'Jdon' shirt for you all.

650
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:15,653
Um, the art was done by the ever-so-talented Dino.

651
00:56:15,653 --> 00:56:18,653
Thank you so much for making

652
00:56:18,653 --> 00:56:21,153
the Chunni shirt of my dreams!

653
00:56:21,153 --> 00:56:24,153
It looks so cool! I'm in the pose.

654
00:56:24,153 --> 00:56:27,653
You can wear this to all your Chunni outings,

655
00:56:27,653 --> 00:56:31,153
or just every day at home, because every day is a Chunni day.

656
00:56:31,153 --> 00:56:34,653
Please get the T-shirt! It is official.

657
00:56:34,653 --> 00:56:37,153
I have a 'jdon my soul' t... I can't believe it.

658
00:56:37,153 --> 00:56:39,153
Hi! Okay, next!

659
00:56:39,153 --> 00:56:42,653
We have—da-da-da-da—we have the acrylic stand...

660
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:47,153
...of the wonderful 'Jdon' artwork that Dino has drawn.

661
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,153
So you can make your home even more Chunni.

662
00:56:50,153 --> 00:56:54,153
This entire set is just making your entire life Chunni.

663
00:56:54,153 --> 00:56:56,153
Isn't it amazing?

664
00:56:56,153 --> 00:57:00,153
You can never have enough acrylic stands,

665
00:57:00,153 --> 00:57:03,653
so please consider adding this to your collection. Yes, yes!

666
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:06,153
Okay, next!

667
00:57:06,153 --> 00:57:09,653
Yes, there's still more! Now, to be initiated as a true Chunni,

668
00:57:09,653 --> 00:57:14,153
you have to be carrying a secret medallion that no one knows about,

669
00:57:14,153 --> 00:57:18,153
because it will give you secret powers of the Chunni.

670
00:57:18,153 --> 00:57:22,153
So, I present to you a special medallion that has the powers of the Jdon...

671
00:57:22,153 --> 00:57:27,153
...Jdon engraved into the front and back so that you never forget your Chunni soul

672
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:30,653
wherever you are. You have to carry this wherever you go

673
00:57:30,653 --> 00:57:34,153
in order to be a true Chunni. Yes, yes, yes!

674
00:57:34,153 --> 00:57:36,653
Okay, next!

675
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:41,653
Next we have the 'Cage of Ice' tray because Hakos Baelz

676
00:57:41,653 --> 00:57:45,153
is forever trapped in a cage of ice,

677
00:57:45,153 --> 00:57:48,653
and you can experience that too by making custom ice cubes of my face!

678
00:57:48,653 --> 00:57:53,153
And also Los Squeakos, and also there's like cheese and other stuff.

679
00:57:53,153 --> 00:57:56,653
But you know me, ice isn't enough,

680
00:57:56,653 --> 00:58:00,653
so there's a possibility that it could withstand some heat,

681
00:58:00,653 --> 00:58:04,653
maybe even some baked goods? I don't know.

682
00:58:04,653 --> 00:58:09,653
Please check the product description before use, of course. But whoa!

683
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,653
The possibility is there. I don't know.

684
00:58:12,653 --> 00:58:15,653
Anyway, next!

685
00:58:15,653 --> 00:58:21,153
This time we also have a voice pack that narrates the life of a Chunni Rat.

686
00:58:21,153 --> 00:58:26,653
It follows the journey of a Chunni princess who's been cast to the human world in hiding,

687
00:58:26,653 --> 00:58:31,153
waiting to return while anticipating the attack of the century.

688
00:58:31,153 --> 00:58:36,153
Believe it or not, this is based off an actual fanfic that I wrote by hand

689
00:58:36,153 --> 00:58:40,653
that will never see the day of light... again.

690
00:58:40,653 --> 00:58:44,153
The day of light? Did I just say that? The light of day again.

691
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:46,653
Thank you very much! Next!

692
00:58:46,653 --> 00:58:51,653
Last but not least, we have the full set purchase bonus item, which is

693
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:56,653
the official 'Jdon' card that is signed by yours truly.

694
00:58:56,653 --> 00:59:01,653
Honestly, I said I was never gonna do this again. But it was Chunni merch, I had to!

695
00:59:01,653 --> 00:59:07,653
I will be signing every single card of every single person's full set purchase.

696
00:59:07,653 --> 00:59:13,653
So please consider purchasing the full set, because I want all of you guys to be part of the Jdon club.

697
00:59:13,653 --> 00:59:19,653
Thank you so much for the support as always, and I really hope you enjoyed this performance live.

698
00:59:19,653 --> 00:59:24,153
I really, really pushed myself to the limit this time, so I hope it paid off.

699
00:59:24,153 --> 00:59:30,153
Um, there's also the membership portion of this live, so it's not over yet!

700
00:59:30,153 --> 00:59:35,153
It includes a very, very special performance.

701
00:59:35,153 --> 00:59:39,653
So please join the Rat Pack if you haven't already. I'll see you guys there!

702
00:59:39,653 --> 00:59:44,653
I am incapable of thinking anymore, so I'm-a just end it here.

703
00:59:44,653 --> 00:59:48,153
Jdon my soul! Please get the merch! Whoa!

704
00:59:48,153 --> 00:59:52,653
#CHU2BAE for life! Thank you!

705

CHU2BAEは命!
CHU2BAE is life!

706
01:00:00,165 --> 01:00:05,965
"You can't be mad at me... I'm cute."

707
01:00:17,165 --> 01:00:22,665
"The age of 30 is in demand"

708
01:00:37,565 --> 01:00:42,965
"HAKOS BAELZ!"

709
01:00:57,765 --> 01:01:01,165
"WITNESS ME!!!!!"

710
