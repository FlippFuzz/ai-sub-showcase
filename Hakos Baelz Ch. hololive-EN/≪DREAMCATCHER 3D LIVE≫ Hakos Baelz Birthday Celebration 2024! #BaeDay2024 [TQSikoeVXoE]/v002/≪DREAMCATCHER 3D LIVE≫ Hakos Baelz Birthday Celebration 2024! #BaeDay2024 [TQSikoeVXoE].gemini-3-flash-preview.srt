DREAM CATCHER
Hakos Baelz Birthday Live 2024

3
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:18,000
A BEGINNING

4
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,800
There was once a little rat that dreamed.

5
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,500
She dreamed of a life filled with her loves:

6
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,300
singing, dancing, and anime.

7
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,500
Bae! Dinner time!

8
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Oh!

9
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,000
半端なら K.O.
If you're half-hearted, you're K.O.

10
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,200
ふわふわしたいなら DANZA
If you want to feel light, then dance!

11
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,600
火炎準備さあ O.K.
Ready the flames, okay?

12
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,300
泣いても笑っても愛してね
Whether I cry or laugh, love me, all right?

13
00:03:51,300 --> 00:04:00,000
踊 / Lyrics: DECO*27 / Composition: Giga / TeddyLoid
Odori / Lyrics: DECO*27 / Composition: Giga / TeddyLoid

14
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,400
ほら SEINO 手を響かせろ
Come on, one-two! Clap your hands!

15
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,300
難解となってつまんない 事もあるでしょう
I'm sure there are times when things get complicated and boring.

16
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,100
ロンリー・ロンリーなの？ 案外本気出そう
Are you lonely-lonely? Let's get surprisingly serious.

17
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,800
嫌んなっちゃって泥に 吐くほどだろうが
Even if you're sick of it and vomit in the mud,

18
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,000
溺れ堕ちてゆけ
Go ahead and drown in it.

19
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,800
それそれ行こうか
Come on, let's go!

20
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,600
もっと頑張って 渇望にもっと頑張って
Try harder, try harder for your cravings!

21
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,700
繋がるわ 一人より二人 増えたら安心 心配ないや
We're connected; two is better than one.
More people means peace of mind, no worries!

22
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,400
All right 任せてどんまい 甘い甘いな みんなで乗っかっちゃえば
All right, leave it to me, don't mind.
How sweet, if we all jump on together...

23
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,500
ほら案外 スパッとイッちゃいそう
Look, it'll probably go smoothly!

24
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
半端なら K.O.
If you're half-hearted, you're K.O.

25
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,300
ふわふわしたいなら DANZA
If you want to feel light, then dance!

26
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,700
火炎準備さあ O.K.
Ready the flames, okay?

27
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,100
泣いても笑っても愛してね
Whether I cry or laugh, love me, all right?

28
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,000
ほら SEINO 手を響かせろ
Come on, one-two! Clap your hands!

29
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:04,588
Rampampam...

30
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,288
踊りだせ、踊りだせ / 孤独を割け　間に寄れ
Dance away, dance away / Split the solitude, follow me

31
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:17,788
痛みまで教えて / 心でバイバイ let go
Tell me even your pain / Let go with a 'bye bye' in your heart

32
00:05:34,788 --> 00:05:35,988
Here we go!

33
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:39,288
どんなレッツゴー　ガンダッドン / 理想狂の化粧番です
Any kind of let's go, gun-da-don / It's a mad idealist's make-up shift

34
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,288
最高で掴んでしまうでしょう　A-yeah
I'll probably grab it at its best, A-yeah

35
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:45,788
Up and down　脳内 attention / 目回っちゃってるの　そっと
Up and down, attention in my brain / I'm getting dizzy, quietly

36
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,788
ドバっと吹き出すのは本音の独り言
What's gushing out is a monologue of true feelings

37
00:05:50,638 --> 00:05:52,188
別に興味ない
I'm not particularly interested

38
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:54,088
特に関係ない
It doesn't really matter

39
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,288
塞ぎ込んで鉄砲脱腸べ
Shutting myself in, a gun and a hernia

40
00:05:57,588 --> 00:06:01,288
合図は奏でて bra-bra-bra-play
The signal is playing, bra-bra-bra-play

41
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:06,288
ほら集まって夜光だ Hey-yay
Look, gather around, it's a nocturnal light, Hey-yay

42
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,288
泣いていこう
Let's keep crying

43
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,588
Rampampam...

44
00:06:30,788 --> 00:06:33,788
世間！ Rampampam...
Society! Rampampam...

45
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:39,288
合羽なら K.O.!
If it's a raincoat, K.O.!

46
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:45,788
Woah woah woah...

47
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:50,288
踊りだせ、踊りだせ / 孤独を割け　間に寄れ
Dance away, dance away / Split the solitude, follow me

48
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,288
痛みまで教えて / 今宵はアッテンパーティだ
Tell me even your pain / Tonight is an up-and-down party

49
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,288
上っ面残して化けた fu-fu-fu
Left the superficiality and transformed, fu-fu-fu

50
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:13,288
次回までお元気で / 心でバイバイ let go
Stay well until next time / Let go with a 'bye bye' in your heart

51
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:31,788
Bye bye! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

52
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:34,588
WHAT'S UP!

53
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,413
I am Chaos, the end of end,

54
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:39,788
a still birth trapped in a cage of ice,

55
00:07:39,788 --> 00:07:44,288
your best friend Hakos Baelz from hololive English!

56
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:47,038
我はカオス、終わりの果て
I am Chaos, the end of end,

57
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,788
ザ・エンド。氷の檻に踏み去りし黒金の薔薇
The End. A jet-black rose left behind in a cage of ice.

58
00:07:50,788 --> 00:07:55,288
汝の友、ホロライブのハコス・ベールズです！
Your friend, Hakos Baelz from hololive!

59
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:58,288
Witness me!

60
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:01,788
Guys, it's finally, finally, finally my birthday!

61
00:08:01,788 --> 00:08:04,038
It is finally my... Do you understand?

62
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:06,288
It's been... it's finally my birthday!

63
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:10,288
Welcome to my Birthday Live 2024,

64
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:12,788
DREAMCATCHER!

65
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:16,413
I'm so thankful that I could do a birthday live

66
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,638
for my real birthday this year.

67
00:08:19,638 --> 00:08:22,288
And I have a special, special stage made for it,

68
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:23,788
which I'll talk about in a second.

69
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:27,788
But please use the hashtag #BaeDay2024

70
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:30,288
to share your comments, and your thoughts,

71
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:31,788
and screenshots, and anything,

72
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:34,288
cause I'm going to be reading it after the stream.

73
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:35,588
Thank you so much!

74
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:37,638
I'm so excited! Look at this stage!

75
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:41,038
I had an original stage design! Oh my god!

76
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:42,413
We've got the butterfly,

77
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:44,413
we've got the water and fire!

78
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:46,038
How does that work? Nobody knows!

79
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:47,038
It's so chuuni, I love it!

80
00:08:47,288 --> 00:08:48,288
Wee!

81
00:08:48,638 --> 00:08:50,288
かっこいいでしょう？
Isn't it cool?

82
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:51,788
へへへ...
Hehehe...

83
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:55,288
Thank you so much for helping me design this stage!

84
00:08:55,288 --> 00:08:56,988
It's so cool!

85
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:59,288
I'm... I'm so excited,

86
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,988
I can't... I can't get anything out.

87
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:03,788
But we have a lot of guests performing today,

88
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:04,788
and we have a lot of songs,

89
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:07,038
so you might not see MC Bae as much.

90
00:09:07,038 --> 00:09:09,788
It's gonna be song after song after song after song!

91
00:09:09,788 --> 00:09:12,988
So get ready! You're not ready!

92
00:09:13,288 --> 00:09:15,288
But also stay until the very end

93
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,038
because I have a very important announcement.

94
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:19,288
Yeah, not a little announcement,

95
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:21,288
a big important announcement

96
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:23,288
that you will never guess.

97
00:09:23,638 --> 00:09:27,413
はい！配信も最後まで見てていけたら嬉しいなと思ってます！
Yes! I hope you can watch the stream until the end!

98
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:30,638
発表がありますので。はい、普通の発表じゃなくて...
Since there is an announcement. It's not a normal one...

99
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:32,788
重大な発表があります！
There is a major announcement!

100
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:36,288
なので、最後までお楽しみみ～げ～！
So, please enjoy until the end!

101
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:41,288
This is a very special birthday live to me.

102
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:45,288
It kind of marks my journey throughout hololive,

103
00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:47,788
and my journey as an idol.

104
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,288
So there's a lot of... there might be some lore,

105
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:53,288
there might be a few important and special guests,

106
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:56,788
and some special songs that I hope you all enjoy!

107
00:09:57,038 --> 00:10:00,788
So I'm just so excited! I'm just so excited!

108
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:03,788
And I'm going to go get ready!

109
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:04,867
the next song and...

110
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:06,767
...I hope you all enjoy.

111
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:09,667
はい！次の曲、ちょっと準備にいきたいと思いますので...
Alright! I'm going to go get ready for the next song, so...

112
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,267
...お楽しみに！
...please look forward to it!

113
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:12,667
じゃ、あとでね。
Well then, see you in a bit.

114
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:14,067
Okay! Okay!

115
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,367
Bye bye! Bye bye! Bye bye!

116
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:17,567
行ってきます！バイバイ！
I'm off! Bye bye!

118
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,467
無限に生きたい
I want to live forever

119
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:52,067
無限に生きられたら
If only I could live forever

120
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:57,967
全てかなう
Everything would come true

121
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:00,967
でも いろんなものが
But so many things...

122
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:06,067
アタシを追い越してく
...are passing me by

123
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:09,267
生き残り時間を
The time I have left to live...

124
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:12,267
夢の座標の行方
...and the coordinates of my dreams

125
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:18,167
全部大事なものなのに
Even though they're all so important to me

126
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:21,967
いっさ ここらでちょっと
So let's take a break here...

127
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:24,767
甘いもの食べていこう
...and eat something sweet

128
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,267
そういう思考停止
Stopping my thoughts like that...

129
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:30,067
ばかり得意になった
...is all I've become good at

130
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,967
歩いてきた道振り返ると
When I look back at the path I've walked

131
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:39,567
嫌なことばかりで
It's full of unpleasant things...

132
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:44,367
もう うんざりだよ
...and I'm sick of it

133
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:50,867
触れるものを輝かせていく
Making everything I touch shine

134
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:55,967
そんな道を歩きたい
That's the kind of path I want to live

135
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:57,167
あたしだよ
It's me

136
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:10,167
一生に生きたい
I want to live my whole life

137
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:15,367
褪せてばかりの日々
In these days full of impatience

138
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:19,767
全て消えそう
Everything seems like it'll vanish

139
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:22,367
でも さぼってみる
But I'll try slacking off...

140
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,567
だって 疲れちゃうじゃない
...because I'll just get tired otherwise

141
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:28,367
そんな矛盾思考
Such contradictory thoughts...

142
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:31,267
アタシ頭どっか
...I'm just overthinking it all

143
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,967
知らないうちに
Before I knew it...

144
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:39,567
歌みたいだ
...it's like a song

145
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:43,567
いっさ ここらでちょっと
So let's take a break here...

146
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:46,067
酔いへいいとこ
...and enjoy the evening

147
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:48,867
ずっと起きてられる
I can stay awake forever...

148
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:51,867
薬 頂けませんか
...can I have some medicine for that?

149
00:12:54,867 --> 00:13:00,067
ぼさっと突っ立ってるだけでも
Even if I'm just standing there blankly...

150
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:06,367
化石になってしまいそうなんだよ
...I feel like I'm going to turn into a fossil

151
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:12,067
誰からも忘れられたような
Like I've been forgotten by everyone...

152
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:17,067
かすかな存在になってしまうよ
...becoming a faint existence

153
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:32,767
いっさ ここらでちょっと
So let's take a break here...

154
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:35,967
根性を見せてやる
...and show some guts

155
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:38,867
自分で頬叩いて
Slapping my own cheeks...

156
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:41,767
存在の証明
...as proof of my existence

157
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:48,967
歩いてきた道振り返らない
I won't look back at the path I've walked

158
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:52,367
嫌なことばかりでも前進め
Even if it's full of unpleasant things, move forward

159
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:57,567
触れるものを輝かせていく
Making everything I touch shine

160
00:13:57,567 --> 00:14:02,867
そんな存在になっていく
I'll become that kind of person

161
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:09,067
見せるよ
I'll show you

162
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:11,767

00:36:19,391 --> 00:36:25,391
この体を投げ出すその瞬間が　あるとすれば
If there's a moment to throw this body away

408

雨に溺れることなんてさ　それほどないな

Bae, you're on in five.

424
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:43,091
Never did she think she would be living out her wildest dream.

00:51:20,454 --> 00:51:23,654
もう、ありがとうございます。
Thank you so much.

618
00:51:24,454 --> 00:51:26,654
もう、神。もう、声。もう...
Already a god. Already that voice. Already...

619
00:51:27,654 --> 00:51:30,654
お願い、もう、死んでいい。もう、ありがとうございます。
Please, I can die happy now. Thank you so much.

620
00:51:31,954 --> 00:51:34,554
本当にありがとうございます！
Thank you so much, really!

621
00:51:35,854 --> 00:51:39,154
Ah, I... I have no words.

622
00:51:39,754 --> 00:51:41,054
ありがとうございます。
Thank you.

623
00:51:41,254 --> 00:51:42,654
本当、Thank you.
Really, thank you.

624
00:51:42,954 --> 00:51:47,954
I am the biggest Yuki fan, and I just want to cry.

625
00:51:47,954 --> 00:51:50,454
ターニャ大好き！ありがとうございました。
I love Tanya! Thank you so much.

626
00:51:51,054 --> 00:51:57,054
I will, I want to... I don't... I can't speak. I...

627
00:51:57,054 --> 00:51:58,254
Thank you.

628
00:51:58,854 --> 00:52:01,854
Thank you so much for making this happen.

629
00:52:01,854 --> 00:52:03,154
Thank you.

630
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:06,654
悠木碧さん！
Yuki Aoi-san!!

631
00:52:07,154 --> 00:52:13,654
Okay, where am I? What do I do now? Where was I?

632
00:52:14,154 --> 00:52:16,454
Oh, okay, I just had a... okay.

633
00:52:16,954 --> 00:52:19,654
So, I have birthday merch.

634
00:52:20,254 --> 00:52:21,654
I have birthday merch.

635
00:52:22,054 --> 00:52:35,054
Birthday Merch Complete Set

636
00:52:25,154 --> 00:52:30,654
I'm kind of shook right now. You may be shook too by what you see.

637
00:52:31,654 --> 00:52:35,054
But hey, I have birthday merch, and I'm coming out with a dakimakura.

638
00:52:35,054 --> 00:53:04,654
#SleepWellBae Body Pillow Cover

639
00:52:35,054 --> 00:52:41,154
I'm in shock, but maybe you'll be in shock too because I said I was never doing this.

640
00:52:41,654 --> 00:52:47,454
But hey, it turns out this is a birthday that I've always dreamed of.

641
00:52:47,654 --> 00:52:51,654
And hey, it's a birthday you've always dreamed of, because now you get a dakimakura...

642
00:52:51,654 --> 00:52:53,654
...which I said I was never gonna do.

643
00:52:53,654 --> 00:52:56,654
But hey, it's pretty cute, you should get it.

644
00:52:56,654 --> 00:53:00,254
It's very realistic, this is what I look like when I wake up in the morning.

645
00:53:00,854 --> 00:53:04,954
I also have a second good... what else did I make? I don't know, my brain's off.

646
00:53:05,454 --> 00:53:10,054
Oh, I made Apple & Bae-nanas fridge magnets.

647
00:53:05,454 --> 00:53:23,654
#Apples&Bae-nanas Rubber Magnet Set

648
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:13,154
They're pretty cute, you should get that too.

00:53:13,254 --> 00:53:15,354
You can put the stuff on the fridge.

650
00:53:16,654 --> 00:53:19,654
They're pretty cute, you should get it.

651
00:53:20,654 --> 00:53:24,654
I think I had one more item. I had a phone strap.

652
00:53:23,654 --> 00:53:38,654
#BaeNeedsOne Smartphone Shoulder Strap

653
00:53:24,654 --> 00:53:28,154
Bae needs oxygen right now. And also a phone strap...

654
00:53:29,154 --> 00:53:31,654
...because it's good for travel.

655
00:53:32,254 --> 00:53:35,054
Yeah, it's very handy, you should get it.

656
00:53:36,654 --> 00:53:39,154
And also, I have a situation voice.

657
00:53:38,654 --> 00:53:55,654
Voice Pack
Situation Voice Pack "29.02.2024"

658
00:53:39,154 --> 00:53:44,154
It is a very special message for my brat and for myself in four years' time.

659
00:53:48,654 --> 00:53:50,654
Yeah, you should get it.

660
00:53:50,654 --> 00:53:55,654
Also, normally there is limited goods, but there aren't any this year...

661
00:53:56,154 --> 00:54:40,654
Complete Set Purchase Bonus
Postcard with a handwritten autograph.

662
00:53:56,654 --> 00:54:01,154
...because I decided I'm gonna sign every single person's postcard...

663
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,454
...if you buy the full set!

664
00:54:03,454 --> 00:54:07,154
You only get a birthday once every four years, and you know what?

665
00:54:07,154 --> 00:54:10,154
I think you all deserve it.

666
00:54:10,154 --> 00:54:15,654
I don't care if my hand falls off. If you buy the full set, you are guaranteed a signed postcard.

667

Thank you very much, really, for everything.

669
00:54:25,654 --> 00:54:28,454
Hi, thank you so much for supporting me.

670
00:54:28,454 --> 00:54:32,654
Please get it. There is no limited sale, only the limited period.

671
00:54:32,654 --> 00:54:37,154
The entire merch is available, so you don't have to rush to get in line.

672
00:54:37,154 --> 00:54:39,654
You can just get it within the normal sale period.

673
00:54:39,854 --> 00:54:41,154
Yeah.

674
00:54:41,454 --> 00:54:44,054
Thank you, よろしくお願いします。
Thank you, please look forward to it.

675
00:54:44,454 --> 00:54:47,654
That is all for today. I'm gonna go cry now.

676
00:54:47,954 --> 00:54:49,454
I hope that was good.

677
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,154
Bye! I'm gonna go... what just happened? Oh my god, I need water. Okay, bye.

678
00:56:02,213 --> 00:56:05,413
Who was that I heard?

679
00:56:05,413 --> 00:56:07,413
Did you want an encore?

680
00:56:09,413 --> 00:56:11,413
My heart is still shaking...

681
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:12,413
...but it's okay!

682
00:56:12,913 --> 00:56:15,413
Because we still have one more song.

683
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:19,413
We have time for one more song until the end of the show.

684
00:56:19,413 --> 00:56:21,413
I wanted to finish off with a bang!

685
00:56:21,413 --> 00:56:24,913
Um, and I would like to perform one more song for you guys as the encore song.

686
00:56:24,913 --> 00:56:28,413
And it's a very important song to me, very special to my heart.

687
00:56:28,413 --> 00:56:29,913
So I hope you'll listen.

688
00:56:29,913 --> 00:56:31,913
はい、どうぞ！ かくれんぼ！
All right, here it is! Kakurenbo!

689
00:56:38,413 --> 00:56:42,913
いっせーので鳴り響く　スタートの合図
Ready, set, go! The signal to start rings out

690
00:56:43,413 --> 00:56:48,913
点と線で結んだ世界　色づいていくここから
The world connected by dots and lines begins to take on color from here

691
00:56:51,913 --> 00:56:55,913
かくれんぼ
Lyrics: TKT Composition: EREN
Kakurenbo
Lyrics: TKT Composition: EREN

692
00:56:58,913 --> 00:57:03,913
転んで転がる頃　既にここにあった
By the time I tumbled and rolled, it was already right here

693
00:57:03,913 --> 00:57:09,413
僕じゃない誰かの記憶が　呼び人と共に蘇る
Someone else's memories, not mine, resurface along with the one calling

694
00:57:10,413 --> 00:57:15,413
古ぼけた絵本を取り出して
Taking out an old, worn-out picture book

695
00:57:15,413 --> 00:57:20,913
落書きの中に一つの　答えを見つけた
Among the scribbles, I found a single answer

696
00:57:20,913 --> 00:57:25,913
自分の価値に目を疑って　どこまでだって落ちていけるの
Doubting my own worth, wondering how far down I can fall

697
00:57:25,913 --> 00:57:31,413
どこか遠くに消えてしまいたい　こんな世界じゃ僕は要らない
Wanting to disappear somewhere far away, I'm not needed in a world like this

698
00:57:31,913 --> 00:57:36,913
カウントダウンが始まっているよ
The countdown has already begun

699
00:57:36,913 --> 00:57:42,413
いっせーので声を上げて　聞こえてくるんだ
Ready, set, shout! I can hear it coming

700
00:57:42,413 --> 00:57:47,413
自分の影の長さに気付く　もうこんな時間だ
Noticing the length of my own shadow, it's already that time

701
00:57:47,913 --> 00:57:52,913
一等星が顔を出した　届きそうで手を伸ばした
A first-magnitude star peeked out, I reached out my hand as if it were within reach

702
00:57:53,413 --> 00:57:58,413
次は僕についてきなよと　どんな暗闇でも
"Follow me next," even in the darkness

703
00:57:58,413 --> 00:58:00,413
もういいかい？
Are you ready?

704
00:58:00,413 --> 00:58:01,913
まだだよ
Not yet

705
00:58:01,913 --> 00:58:04,413
幕は上がり出した
The curtain has begun to rise

706
00:58:04,413 --> 00:58:05,913
もういいかい？
Are you ready?

707
00:58:05,913 --> 00:58:07,913
まーだだよ
Not yet

708
00:58:07,913 --> 00:58:12,413
色づいていくここから
Taking on color from here

709
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:24,413
10年後の僕らは　すれ違いばかりで
Ten years from now, we'll probably just be passing each other by

710
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:29,913
幻想に思いを馳せては　戻れないそう思い込んだ
Lost in fantasies, I convinced myself there was no going back

711
00:58:30,913 --> 00:58:35,913
くたびれた心に追いつきを　あの頃と変わらない夕陽も
Catching up with my worn-out heart, even the sunset hasn't changed since then

712
00:58:35,913 --> 00:58:40,413
なんとも思わない
I don't feel a thing

713
00:58:40,913 --> 00:58:45,913
自分を信じ歩いていければ　どこまでだって登れるのに
If I could just believe in myself and keep walking, I could climb to any height

714
00:58:45,913 --> 00:58:50,913
あどけなくその空白に　大切なもの見落としている
In that blank space, I'm overlooking something important

715
00:58:51,913 --> 00:58:56,913
見つけられないと泣き喚く君へ
To you, who cries out that you can't find it

716
00:58:56,913 --> 00:59:01,913
いっせーので声を上げて　聞こえてくるんだ
Ready, set, shout! I can hear it coming

717
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:06,913
自分の影の長さに気付く　もうこんな時間だ
Noticing the length of my own shadow, it's already that time

718
00:59:07,413 --> 00:59:12,413
一生懸命駆け抜ける君　俯いてただけの僕でも
You, who runs through it all, even for someone like me who just hung my head

719
00:59:12,413 --> 00:59:17,413
君の前を歩けるから　こんな頼りない僕でも
I can walk ahead of you, even if I'm this unreliable

720
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:44,913
宝箱は埃を　被ったまま失くした
The treasure chest was lost, still covered in dust

721
00:59:44,913 --> 00:59:49,913
鍵はずっと君の　ポケットの中にあった
The key was in your pocket all along

722
00:59:50,413 --> 00:59:55,413
散らばっていた全てが　今一つに重なる
Everything that was scattered now overlaps as one

723
00:59:55,913 --> 01:00:00,913
手を取り始めよう　僕たちの物語
Let's take hands and begin our story

724
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:03,839
もう一回は
I thought

725
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,439
いらないと思ってた
I didn't need one more time

726
01:00:06,439 --> 01:00:09,039
湿ったままで
I felt like I could

727
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:11,539
胸を張れる気がしたんだ
hold my head high even while wet

728
01:00:11,539 --> 01:00:16,839
全てが愛おしくて
Everything is so precious

729
01:00:16,839 --> 01:00:19,439
思い出に重なる
The cheers that overlap

730
01:00:19,439 --> 01:00:22,039
掛け声はいつも
with memories are always...

731
01:00:22,839 --> 01:00:24,939
でいっせーのーで声を上げて
So on the count of three, raise your voice!

732
01:00:24,939 --> 01:00:27,539
いっせーのーで声を上げて
On the count of three, raise your voice

733
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:30,039
聞こえてくるんだ
I can hear it

734
01:00:30,039 --> 01:00:32,739
自分の影の長さに気づく
I notice the length of my shadow

735
01:00:32,739 --> 01:00:35,239
もうこんな時間だ
it's already this late

736
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:37,839
愛おしさが顔を出した
Preciousness showed its face

737
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:40,539
孤独色で手を伸ばした
I reached out with the color of loneliness

738
01:00:40,539 --> 01:00:43,539
次は僕に付いてきなよと
Follow me next time

739
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:46,339
暗闇を歩もう
let's walk through the darkness

740
01:00:46,339 --> 01:00:47,739
もういいかい？
Are you ready?

741
01:00:47,739 --> 01:00:49,039
まだだよ
Not yet

742
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:51,439
泣きじゃくった声で
with a sobbing voice

743
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:52,939
もういいかい？
Are you ready?

744
01:00:52,939 --> 01:00:54,339
まだだよ
Not yet

745
01:00:54,339 --> 01:00:57,039
笑う君が見えた
I saw you laughing

746
01:00:57,039 --> 01:00:58,439
もういいかい？
Are you ready?

747
01:00:58,439 --> 01:00:59,739
まだだよ
Not yet

748
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:02,339
泣く僕を連れ出して
take me out as I cry

749
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:03,739
もういいかい？
Are you ready?

750
01:01:03,739 --> 01:01:05,039
もういいよ
I'm ready

751
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:07,639
色付いていくここから
from here it starts to gain color

752
01:01:18,539 --> 01:01:19,239
Hey!

753
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:19,839
Hey!

754
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:20,439
Hey!

755
01:01:20,439 --> 01:01:21,139
Hey!

756
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:21,739
Hey!

757
01:01:21,739 --> 01:01:22,339
Hey!

758
01:01:22,339 --> 01:01:22,939
Hey!

759
01:01:22,939 --> 01:01:23,539
Hey!

760
01:01:29,179 --> 01:01:30,539
Thank you!

761
01:01:30,689 --> 01:01:33,439
This has been the best birthday ever!

762
01:03:49,839 --> 01:04:19,039
Thank you for the best bday ever! Without you guys I never would have come this far. This Rat will continue doing her best! -BAELZ
