00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,420
はららはらり　今　踊り踊れ
Halarahalarai, now dance, dance

3
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,950
恋焦がれ遊べ　桜打て歌え
Play with yearning, strike the cherry blossoms and sing

日進月歩　八百万時が過ぎゆく
Day by day, eight million moments pass by

9
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,800
色取り取り様々連林囃子
Many colors, various forest rhythms

10
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,350
あんな事も　籠掘り込み
Throwing even those things into the basket

11
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,000
欲にまみれ生きていたい
I want to live covered in desires

12
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,200
人生寄り道　回り道
Life is a detour, a roundabout way

13
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,550
生きたいように生きなはれや
Live exactly as you want to

酸いも甘いも祭り囃子
Both sour and sweet, the festival music

味わい尽くしてしまいましょう
Let's savor it all to the end

Now, what shall we devour first?

人生気づけば　夢の如し
Before you know it, life is like a dream

Eat it up and sing

47
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:04,208
離れ離れでも花火上げて
Even if we're apart, let's set off fireworks

誰そう願えど手元の世界に夢中
No matter who wishes so, I'm obsessed with the world in my hands

57
00:06:12,808 --> 00:06:16,208
化け物の飼い方を学んでる
I'm learning how to keep a monster

選ばれるためなら舌を売る
I'll sell my tongue just to be chosen

59
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:22,808
裏切られた分だけ墓を掘る
I'll dig as many graves as I've been betrayed

60
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,108
ヘラヘラの御紬どうにかして
Do something about that frivolous weaving

61
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:29,308
うすうす寒い言葉ばかり丸
Just a bunch of faintly chilling words

62
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:31,208
覚えない言葉バイバイできるなら
If I can say goodbye to words I don't remember

63
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,208
阿修羅にだってなれるわ
I can even become an Ashura

64
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,508
逃げるエスケープ・エスケープ端から端のまま
Running, escape, escape, staying from end to end

飛べるステップ・ステップ汚名のまま
Flying, step, step, staying with the infamy

語るスニーク・スニーク阿修羅の中

ねえ、あんたがっちゃいねえ

日々の染みを木々にくべて暖を取り合う
Feeding daily stains to the trees, we warm each other

76
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:22,708
義を強いて枯れの獅子はちりぢりになる
Forcing righteousness, the withered lions scatter

77
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:26,008
知りもせずに意味を美意識だと崇める
Worshipping meaning as aesthetics without even knowing

78
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:29,308
疑似餌地道死の己が性
Lure, steady, death, my own nature

79
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:32,708
不快な語彙宅の古媚に
In the old flattery of unpleasant vocabulary

80
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,808
上辺の面をして可愛がった
Wore a superficial face and showed affection

81
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:37,508
下らない忖度踊るくらいなら
If I have to dance to worthless conjectures

82
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:40,808
悪魔と手繋ぐわ
I'll hold hands with the devil

83

...the aesthetics of traditional Japanese...

131
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:46,516
No, that's not how it goes. It's the traditional Japanese aesthetic plus dance.

えっとね、今日のライブね、テーマはね、和とダンスですよ。
Well, for today's live, the theme is 'Wa' and dance.

Who knows? I might be gone by the end. Who knows? I really don't know if I'm gonna survive tonight.

140
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:27,516
But, I hope you are in the ride... Oh, that's not how the saying goes. Wow, I actually can't talk.

141
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:31,016
Hope you guys stay on this crazy ride with me until the very end.

142
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:36,516
Um, but yeah! So we did Kyutyu-ri-pappa... I can never say that song right.

143
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:39,016
As the opening, it was so much fun.

144
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:43,016
De-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de with my amazing dancers, as usual.

00:11:43,116 --> 00:11:46,516
I hope that was a good opener. And also, Ashi-no-chon!

150
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:08,016
I did my best. So, I hope Miki-sensei is proud of me. Yes!

151
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:15,516
Uh, that's... and you can compare how I was at, you know, the afternoon with what you just saw.

152
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:22,016
But! The show is going to keep on going, it keeps on giving.

Guest, we're moving on to the guest part, but I wonder who it is?

155
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,516
Who could it be? I don't know, we'll see.

156
00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:38,016
You better stay, okay? I'm gonna go. Don't... don't you go anywhere. Okay?

Thank you. I'm honored. Thank you.

232
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:39,064
あの、ちょっとまあ、お恥ずかしい話なんですけど...
Um, this is a bit of an embarrassing story, but...

233
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:45,344
あの、KANKANさんの曲を初めて聞いた時、電車中にたまたまに流れたんですよ。
When I first heard KANKAN's music, it happened to play while I was on the train.

234
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:50,104
で、普通に夢中になってて、あの、降りるトコも乗り過ぎました。
And I just got so absorbed in it that I missed my stop.

235
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:53,324
おお！！ そんな夢中になって聞いてくれてたんですか？
Oh!! You were listening that intently?

236
00:16:53,324 --> 00:17:00,054
本当にめちゃくちゃ綺麗で... はい、本当に一緒に『傀儡』歌って、できて、本当に嬉しい！
It was just so incredibly beautiful... Yes, I'm so happy we could sing "Kaira" together!

00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:03,924
こちらこそ本当に。素敵な機会をいただいて。
Same here, really. Thank you for this wonderful opportunity.

238
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:07,154
まさかこの『傀儡』を選択してもらえると思ってなくて。
I never thought you'd choose "Kaira."

239
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:09,544
まさかのチョイスなんですよ、自分的には。
It was a surprising choice for me, personally.

240
00:17:09,544 --> 00:17:17,454
うわあ。でもね、さっきも必死で歌ったんですけども、KANKANさんの声ってさ、もうヤバイですよ、本当に。
Wow. But you know, I was singing my heart out just now, but KANKAN's voice is just... it's insane, really.

241
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,484
恐縮です。
You're too kind.

242
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:25,564
で、なんとKANKANさん、これも3D初登場じゃないですか！
And KANKAN, this is also your 3D debut, isn't it!

243
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:32,024
そうなんですよ。もう全部が初めてなんですよ、今日。全部初めて。全部。
That's right. Everything is a first today. Everything is a first. Everything.

244
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:41,824
うわあ！その動き見せてくださいよ、もう。うわあ！ 3D、どういう感じですか？ KANKANを見ろ！
Wow! Show us those moves! Wow! How is 3D feeling? Look at KANKAN!

245
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:43,064
どういう感じ？
How does it feel?

246
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:48,564
え、やっぱりなんか、普段はライブ出る時は、やっぱり生身の体で出ることが多いんですけど。
Well, usually when I perform live, I'm often there in the flesh.

247
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:57,084
はい。やっぱり全然動き方とかも違うし、全てが新感覚で。おお、はい、ありがとうございます。
Yes. But the way I move and everything is totally different, it's a whole new sensation. Oh, yes, thank you.

248
00:17:57,084 --> 00:18:02,064
いや、素晴らしい！ 楽しいめちゃくちゃ！ 素晴らしい3D世界へようこそ！
No, it's wonderful! It's so much fun! Welcome to the wonderful world of 3D!

00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:11,474
で、あの... 来ました。はい。今回の『傀儡』っていう歌、一緒にあの歌ったんですけど、KANKANさんのオリ曲ですよね。
And, um... here it is. Yes. We sang "Kaira" together today, which is an original song of yours.

251
00:18:11,474 --> 00:18:17,984
あ、そうです。私の、はい。柊マグネタイトさんに作っていただきました素敵な楽曲を、ぜひ。
Ah, yes. It's mine, yes. It's a wonderful track that Hiiragi Magnetite created for me.

252
00:18:17,984 --> 00:18:22,404
いえ。あの、まあ歌詞がめちゃくちゃ難しいんですけど、あの...
Yeah. Um, well the lyrics are incredibly difficult, but...

253
00:18:22,404 --> 00:18:27,554
そうですね。早口だし、詰まってるし、リズムが大変。はい。
That's true. It's fast-paced, packed with words, and the rhythm is tough. Yes.

254
00:18:27,554 --> 00:18:33,444
です。まあちょっとあの、意味とか曲に関してちょっと聞きたいなって思ってるんですけど。
Right. Well, I'd like to ask a bit about the meaning and the song itself.

255
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:38,854
あ、もうなんか、『傀儡』っていうタイトルからしても、雷がついてるじゃないですか。はい！
Ah, well, even from the title "Kaira," it's got lightning in it, doesn't it? Yes!

256
00:18:38,854 --> 00:18:49,024
もうとにかくみんなに、稲妻のような衝撃を与えたいっていう気持ちからで... ちょっとオーダーして、柊マグネタイトさんに。
Basically, from the feeling of wanting to give everyone a shock like a bolt of lightning... I requested that from Hiiragi Magnetite.

257
00:18:49,024 --> 00:18:55,354
もう柊マグネタイトさんならではの、やっぱり迫力のある楽曲を作ってもらいたかったので。
I really wanted them to create a powerful track, which is their specialty.

258
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:59,064
で、その結果この素敵な楽曲を作っていただいたんです。
And as a result, they created this wonderful piece of music.

259
00:18:59,064 --> 00:19:03,904
素晴らしい、本当に。今後もね、一緒になにかコラボできて、本当に... あの... あ、もうぜひ！
Wonderful, truly. In the future as well, I'd love to collaborate on something again... Ah, absolutely!

260
00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:10,894
今日もう... もう言葉出ないヤバイ。どうしよう。すごい全力で歌ったから。
Today I just... I'm speechless, it's crazy. What should I do? Because you sang with all your might.

261
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:18,464
本当どうしよう、本当に。もうファンの気持ちはこういう感じなんだなって。いや、本当にそう思って嬉しいまた。
I really don't know. So this is how a fan feels. I'm just so happy once again.

262
00:19:18,464 --> 00:19:19,474

423
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,540
真相俺は見せるだけ不敵な目線を得るまで
I'll just show you the truth until I get that fearless look.

424
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,040
金食らうほどに下品に艶を
Adding a vulgar gloss as much as money can buy.

425
00:30:07,148 --> 00:30:10,048
我が身を投じる場所なら絶文
If it's a place to throw my life away, it's a masterpiece

426
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:13,248
今この場所この舞台で決定
Decided right here, on this stage

427
00:30:14,048 --> 00:30:16,848
五右衛門みたいに かなかな絶景
Like Goemon, quite a view

428
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:20,548
向かい風 吹いたって
Even if a headwind blows

429
00:30:21,048 --> 00:30:24,048
逆に乗りこなしてやるぜ 俺にとっちゃこれが常で
I'll tame it instead; for me, this is normal

430
00:30:24,148 --> 00:30:27,048
言葉出せぬくらい 暗い時代なんて言うけど
They say it's a dark era where words can't be spoken

431
00:30:27,148 --> 00:30:29,548
だけど見せてやる ぶちかましてやる
But I'll show you, I'll blow you away

432
00:30:29,648 --> 00:30:32,548
俺は人生 必死で死ぬまで 死ねんガチな勢いや実践
In this life, I'm desperate until the end; I can't die with this momentum

433
00:30:32,648 --> 00:30:36,548
その目開け バカでけぇことやろうぜ
Open your eyes, let's do something huge

434
00:30:37,048 --> 00:30:40,048
このまま行こう
Let's keep going like this

435
00:30:40,148 --> 00:30:43,048
どんな前も酸いも 全部かっ攫って見せるぜ
I'll snatch up all the highs and lows

436
00:30:43,548 --> 00:30:46,548
このまま行こう
Let's keep going like this

437
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:49,848
どんな不安や不満や吸い込みに 目食らっても
Even if I'm blinded by anxiety, dissatisfaction, or intake

438
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:52,848
このまま行こう
Let's keep going like this

439
00:30:53,048 --> 00:30:56,248
どうせならばやれることは 全部やっていこうぜ
If we're doing it anyway, let's do everything we can

440
00:30:57,048 --> 00:30:59,548
このまま行こう
Let's keep going like this

441
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:02,848
いつか何もかも 終わってしまったとしても
Even if one day everything comes to an end

442
00:31:03,048 --> 00:31:08,548
野暮な戯言にゃ 目もくれず
Without paying heed to unrefined nonsense

443
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:12,548
俺はこの人生も
I'll make this life, too

444
00:31:12,648 --> 00:31:15,548
ギンギラギンに輝かせてくだけだ
Shine dazzlingly

445
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:28,548
ギンギラギンに ありのままに
Dazzlingly, just as you are

446
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:40,048
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

447
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,548
終わったー！
It's over!

448
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:45,548
終わったー！
It's over!

449
00:31:46,048 --> 00:31:48,548
ということで、二人目のゲスト！
So, our second guest!

450
00:31:48,648 --> 00:31:49,848
自己紹介お願いします！
Please introduce yourself!

451
00:31:50,048 --> 00:31:54,548
はい、ぽぽぽ！ホロライブReGLOSS、轟はじめです！番長！よろしくお願いしまーす！
Hi po po po! Hololive ReGLOSS, Todoroki Hajime-desu! Ban-cho! Nice to meet you!

452
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,548
今日、今日もなんだこれ、うむうむ？
Today, today too, what is this, umu umu?

453
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:01,248
うむうむ、うむうむ。
Umu umu, umu umu.

454
00:32:01,348 --> 00:32:03,048
やめて、そのノリ。もう。
Stop that. Seriously.

455
00:32:03,148 --> 00:32:05,548
こっからもうこれやる、うむうむ。はい、ぽぽぽ。
From here on we're doing this, umu umu. Hi po po po.

456
00:32:05,648 --> 00:32:09,548
いやー、はじめこと番長！めちゃありがとね、来てくれて。
Man, Hajime, aka Ban-cho! Thanks so much for coming.

457
00:32:10,048 --> 00:32:11,548
できたよ！ できたね！
We did it! We did it, right!

458
00:32:12,048 --> 00:32:13,548
できたよ！ できたよね！
We did it! We really did it!

459
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:15,848
ギンギラ、感想はどうですか？
How was 'Gingira'?

460
00:32:16,048 --> 00:32:18,548
いや、難しかったー！
Man, it was hard!

461
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:23,548
あの、まだ見てない方はね、昼にね、一応、ギリギリのダンス練習やってて。
For those who haven't seen it, we had a last-minute dance rehearsal this afternoon.

462
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:27,548
うん。そこで振り作ってたんですよ。
Yeah. We were making the choreography then.

463
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,848
だからもうさっきの、多分、間違えたところもあったと思うので。
So just now, there were probably some mistakes.

464
00:32:31,048 --> 00:32:33,548
そこ、ごめんなさい。すいませんでした、本当に。
I'm sorry about that. I'm really sorry.

465
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,848
まぁ、頑張りましたよね。
Well, we worked hard, didn't we?

466
00:32:36,048 --> 00:32:38,248
はい！でも30分はないよ、普通。
Yes! But 30 minutes isn't enough, normally.

467
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:40,548
いや、本当に短すぎた。
No, it really was too short.

468
00:32:41,048 --> 00:32:42,548
ね！でも楽しかった。
Right! But it was fun.

469
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:44,048
ね！よかった。
Yeah! I'm glad.

470
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:46,048
え、あのね、あそこの振り好きなの。
You know, I like that part of the choreography.

471
00:32:46,148 --> 00:32:48,048
なーにゅなーにゅなーにゅなーにゅなーにゅ。
Nanyunanyunanyunanyunanyu.

472
00:32:48,148 --> 00:32:50,048
わかる！
I know!

473
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:51,548
これがね！
This part!

474
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:53,048
わかる、わかる。めっちゃわかる。
I know, I know. I totally get it.

475
00:32:53,148 --> 00:32:54,048
爆速だったけど。
It was crazy fast, though.

476
00:32:54,148 --> 00:32:55,548
うん、爆速だったのこれでしょう。
Yeah, this was the crazy fast part.

477
00:32:56,048 --> 00:32:58,048
うん、それも速い。
Yeah, that's fast too.

478
00:32:58,148 --> 00:33:01,548
ぅ、ぅ、ぅ、ぅ！これね、めっちゃ速かったね。
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh! This was really fast.

479
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:03,548
でも成功したよね！
But we nailed it!

480
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,548
成功した！本当に嬉しい。
We did! I'm so happy.

481
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:10,548
いや、これもね、あの、みんなから、なんか番長とハコ太郎一緒に踊りたい、踊りたいって。
Well, also, everyone was saying they wanted to see Ban-cho and Hakotaro dance together.

482
00:33:10,648 --> 00:33:14,048
めっちゃコメントもらったんで、これで満足してるかな？
I got so many comments like that, so I hope you're satisfied with this?

483
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:22,048
満足、満足してますか？大好きかな？
Are you satisfied? Do you love it?

484
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:25,548
滑舌取れてつつ分かんない。
I don't know if my articulation was okay.

485
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:29,548
だからまぁ、これからもね、本当に一緒に踊りたいなって。
So, well, I'd really like to dance together again from now on.

486
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:32,048
ね、いつかまた踊ろうね。
Yeah, let's dance again sometime.

487
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:33,848
ね。可愛いし。
Right. And you're cute.

488
00:33:34,148 --> 00:33:36,048
ハコちゃん可愛いじゃない。
Bae-chan, you're cute too.

489
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:37,548
可愛い。何よ。
Cute. What?

490
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,048
え？
Eh?

491
00:33:39,148 --> 00:33:40,048
何を？
What?

492
00:33:41,048 --> 00:33:42,848
何よって言ったら、何よって言ったの。
I said 'What?' and you said 'What?'.

493
00:33:43,048 --> 00:33:44,048
あ、何よか！
Ah, 'What?'!

494
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:46,548
「何を？」って聞こえた。「何よ？」え？
I thought I heard 'Nani o?'. 'Nani yo?' Eh?

495
00:33:47,048 --> 00:33:48,848
聞き間違え！
Misheard it!

496
00:33:49,148 --> 00:33:51,248
ごめん。疲れてるから！
Sorry. I'm tired!

497
00:33:51,648 --> 00:33:53,048
お疲れ様だよ、もう。
You're tired, already.

498
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:57,548
うわー。でも、多分、これ僕も初めてなんですよ。
Whoa. But, probably, this is a first for me too.

499
00:33:58,048 --> 00:33:59,548
ほりゃ？
Oh?

500
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:03,548
あの、他の人と振りを作ることも初めて。
Making choreography with someone else is a first too.

501
00:34:04,048 --> 00:34:05,548
初めて。え、作ったことある？
A first. Eh, have you done it before?

502
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:08,548
ホロライブ入ってからない。
Not since joining Hololive.

503
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:10,548
おお。僕は人生初めて。
Oh. For me, it's a first in my life.

504
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:12,548
えー！嬉しい。
Eh! I'm happy.

505
00:34:13,048 --> 00:34:17,048
他の人と作ったことない。なんか恥ずかしすぎて作れなかった、元々。
I've never made it with anyone else. I was originally too embarrassed to.

506
00:34:17,148 --> 00:34:17,848
恥ずかしい？
Embarrassed?

507
00:34:18,048 --> 00:34:21,048
恥ずかしい。なんか自分の、そう、自分のアイデアちょっと出しすぎかなって。
Embarrassed. Like, 'Is it too much to put my own ideas out?'

508
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:24,548
「いや、無理や、これどうかな？」みたいな。今まで無理やった。
Like 'No, that's impossible, what about this?'. It was impossible until now.

509
00:34:25,048 --> 00:34:27,548
そう、そう。
Yeah, yeah.

510
00:34:28,048 --> 00:34:31,248
え、でもめっちゃかっこよかったよ。
But it was really cool.

511
00:34:31,548 --> 00:34:34,548
ありがとね。ハコちゃんもめっちゃかっこよかったよ。
Thank you. You were really cool too, Bae-chan.

512
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:38,248
And for the overseas people, I hope...

513
00:34:38,348 --> 00:34:41,548
...we've gotten a lot of your messages about wanting to see us perform together...

514
00:34:41,648 --> 00:34:46,048
...so I hope this matched, I don't know, lived up to your expectations.

515
00:34:47,048 --> 00:34:51,548
Um, and if you haven't checked it out, we did do a last-minute dance rehearsal...

516
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:54,848
...making the chorus of the choreography you just saw...

517
00:34:55,048 --> 00:34:58,548
...which is why we may have made a few mistakes because it was so last minute, but!

518
00:34:59,048 --> 00:35:00,048
まぁ、そこはね。
Well, you know how it is.

519
00:35:00,156 --> 00:35:02,156
Please just overlook that anyway.

520
00:35:03,256 --> 00:35:04,256
ありがとね！
Thank you!

521
00:35:04,356 --> 00:35:05,156
ありがとう！
Thank you!

522
00:35:05,256 --> 00:35:06,156
ありがとね。
Thank you.

523
00:35:06,256 --> 00:35:09,156
ベぇちゃんとして、ま今日じゃないけど、お誕生日おめでとう！
As Bae, well it's not today, but Happy Birthday!

524
00:35:09,256 --> 00:35:10,856
ありがとうございます！
Thank you very much!

525
00:35:10,956 --> 00:35:12,656
素敵な１年を過ごしてね。
Have a wonderful year.

526
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:15,056
うふふ。ななななになに？
Hehehe. Wha-wha-what?

527
00:35:15,556 --> 00:35:17,556
まということで、ライブも後半行ってるので、

Okay, let's go. Alright, I'm gonna get ready. Okay.

536
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:59,056
朝が来る
Lyrics, Music: 梶浦由記
Morning is Coming
Lyrics, Music: Yuki Kajiura

537
00:35:56,056 --> 00:36:01,056
傷だらけの世界の端に
On the edge of this world full of wounds,

538
00:36:01,156 --> 00:36:06,556
闇が重たくもたれかかる
Darkness leans heavily,

539
00:36:06,656 --> 00:36:10,556
覚めない時の中
In the time that doesn't wake up,

540
00:36:10,656 --> 00:36:16,256
悲しみはどこまでも追いすがって
Sadness chases everywhere,

541
00:36:16,356 --> 00:36:21,556
それでも空は夜明けを探して
Even so, the sky searches for the dawn,

542
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:25,856
取りに行く未来
The future we go to take...

543
00:36:25,956 --> 00:36:31,056
僕らは弱くも儚くもないよ
We are neither weak nor fleeting,

544
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:34,256
信じて愛して
Believe, love,

545
00:36:34,356 --> 00:36:39,056
燃え尽きていく
and burn out...

546
00:36:39,256 --> 00:36:46,056
繰り返し繰り返し 血を流す魂が
Again and again, the soul that sheds blood,

547
00:36:46,256 --> 00:36:50,856
夢を見るその先に
Beyond that dream...

548
00:36:51,056 --> 00:36:56,556
輝いて輝いて 新しい朝が来る
Shining, shining, a new morning comes,

549
00:36:56,656 --> 00:37:00,056
希望を掲げ
Holding hope high...

550
00:37:08,556 --> 00:37:15,056
君を呼んでいる黎明
The dawn is calling you...

551
00:37:29,056 --> 00:37:34,556
失うことで落ちていくか
Will we fall by losing,

552
00:37:34,656 --> 00:37:40,556
それとも光を追いかけるか
or will we chase the light?

553
00:37:40,656 --> 00:37:46,056
選んできた道に散らした
Scattered on the path we chose,

554
00:37:46,156 --> 00:37:51,556
涙も傷も遠くなって
tears and wounds are far away,

555
00:37:52,056 --> 00:37:58,256
息を殺し強欲の影見上げれ
Hold your breath and look up at the shadow of greed,

556
00:37:58,356 --> 00:38:03,556
それでも鮮やかに風を切って
Even so, cutting through the wind vividly,

557
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:07,556
手に入れる未来
the future we obtain...

558
00:38:07,656 --> 00:38:13,256
情熱がいつだって灯火になるよ
Passion will always be a lamp,

559
00:38:13,356 --> 00:38:17,056
天高く昇れと
Climb high into the sky,

560
00:38:17,156 --> 00:38:20,556
狼煙を上げて
and raise a signal fire,

561
00:38:21,056 --> 00:38:27,556
風になり花開き 魂を掻き鳴らす
Becoming the wind, flowers blooming, playing the soul,

562
00:38:27,656 --> 00:38:32,256
僕らが急ぐ場所へ
to the place where we hurry...

563
00:38:32,356 --> 00:38:37,556
華やいで華やいで 新しい朝が来る
Brilliant, brilliant, a new morning comes,

564
00:38:37,656 --> 00:38:41,056
光が
The light,

565
00:38:41,156 --> 00:38:46,056
たなびく方へ
towards where it drifts...

566
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:52,556
夜のもう一つ向こうまで
To one more beyond the night,

567
00:38:53,056 --> 00:38:58,056
どうしても届かない

Whaaa! How was that? Bang bang bang bang bang!

622
00:44:18,564 --> 00:44:23,564
Oh, I feel like we did a lot of songs and I didn't really get to talk about them

623
00:44:23,564 --> 00:44:26,564
because there were other guest parts in between but,

624
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:31,064
uh, there's a couple of songs that I performed that I've said that I've always wanted to sing

625
00:44:31,064 --> 00:44:33,564
BANG!!! has been one of them, so I hope you enjoyed that

I have TWO announcements!

629
00:44:45,564 --> 00:44:48,064

The first item we have is an acrylic block...

644
00:45:20,572 --> 00:45:23,572

It's art drawn by Mika-mama!

646
00:45:26,572 --> 00:45:28,872

647
00:45:28,872 --> 00:45:30,872
'Wa' is so...

648
00:45:30,872 --> 00:45:32,472
...it's got the heart of...

649
00:45:32,472 --> 00:45:34,572
...the Japanese, I don't really know how to say it.

650
00:45:34,572 --> 00:45:36,572
But um, I've always wanted an acrylic block.

651
00:45:36,572 --> 00:45:38,272
I haven't done—I haven't made one yet.

652
00:45:38,272 --> 00:45:41,072
So I really hope that you display this in your homes.

653
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,372

656
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,572

657
00:45:52,572 --> 00:45:55,372

00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:59,872
あと、あの、一応ダブル、ダブルDって感じ？
Also, um, it's like Double, Double D?

660
00:45:59,872 --> 00:46:03,272
I think it's... I don't really know how to explain it, but...

661
00:46:03,272 --> 00:46:05,572
...it's kind of like a two-layered type acrylic block.

662
00:46:05,572 --> 00:46:09,372
So it kind of gives the image of it being 3D,

663
00:46:09,372 --> 00:46:11,872
which makes it really cool. So if you want, please get it!

664
00:46:11,872 --> 00:46:14,572
イヒヒヒヒ！って感じです。

The Rat Sack II Duffel bag

668
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:23,072
I'm so excited about this one.

669
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:27,572
The next item is the Rat Sack II Duffel bag!

670
00:46:27,572 --> 00:46:31,072
Uh, this is—I wanted to create a dance bag,

671
00:46:31,072 --> 00:46:34,572
...duffel bag, gym bag, because mine is kind of breaking...

672
00:46:34,572 --> 00:46:36,872
...and I kind of need another one.

673
00:46:36,872 --> 00:46:40,072
So, I reused the design that I came up with...

674
00:46:40,072 --> 00:46:44,272
...from I think it was two years ago, my birthday, the very first Rat Sack...

675
00:46:44,272 --> 00:46:48,572
...the crossbody bag if you guys remember. It is the same design...

676
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:52,572
...but just enlarged, and it has a lot of pockets and can fit a lot of things.

677
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:55,872
And also, it's good for gym, it's good for dance...

678
00:46:55,872 --> 00:46:58,572
...it's also good for travel. It's really good carry-on luggage as well...

679
00:46:58,572 --> 00:47:02,872
...'cause it's like big, it fits stuff, but not too big, you know?

680
00:47:02,872 --> 00:47:07,572
Um, and there is like, you know, the transparent pocket...

681
00:47:07,572 --> 00:47:11,572
...like in the original crossbody bag. You can put your pins...

682
00:47:11,572 --> 00:47:14,572
...but they won't like, you know, get destroyed and you can protect them and stuff like that.

683
00:47:14,572 --> 00:47:18,072
Yeah, あの、このバッグがめちゃくちゃお気に入りです。

00:47:57,372 --> 00:48:00,872
There's like the tag and the dice and the cross. It's just very Drip.

...um, I did the dance.

815
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,080
It's kind of concerning when, you know,

816
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:59,479
your original song, you feel like the dance is not as hard as other ones that I did this time, but...

817
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,588
Really is, really fun as well, so I'll be doing...

818
00:55:02,588 --> 00:55:05,588
...I'll be uploading like shorts and stuff as well.

819
00:55:05,588 --> 00:55:09,588
I wanted to, you know, embody the beast.

820
00:55:09,588 --> 00:55:12,588

821
00:55:13,588 --> 00:55:15,588

825
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:28,588
As... as usual, I don't have any idea about anything...

826
00:55:28,588 --> 00:55:31,588
...but I'm told it is midnight at... tonight.

827
00:55:34,588 --> 00:55:37,088
It'll be out, just have a listen to it when it's out.

828
00:55:37,088 --> 00:55:38,588
Thank you very much.

829
00:55:39,088 --> 00:55:41,088

830
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:45,088

I hope I did okay.

837
00:56:01,088 --> 00:56:04,588
I still want to hear all your thoughts after the live.

838
00:56:04,588 --> 00:56:10,088
I'm gonna have a, you know, long look at the hashtag #BaeDDay2025.

839

So... thank you so much for watching as always.

840
00:56:13,088 --> 00:56:15,588
This year I really wanted to focus on dance...

841
00:56:15,588 --> 00:56:17,588
...so I hope, you know, that got across.

842
00:56:17,588 --> 00:56:21,588
今年はやっぱりダンス、もっと頑張りたいなと思ってるんで...
Since I've been wanting to work harder on my dancing this year...

845
00:56:28,588 --> 00:56:31,088
...伝わったらいいなと思ってます。
...I'm just hoping that it did.

846
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:34,588
But I guess that's it! I'm gonna go die now.

847
00:56:34,588 --> 00:56:36,588
Mmm, I'm so tired.

848
00:56:36,588 --> 00:56:39,588
The words exiting my mouth are just gone.

849
00:56:39,588 --> 00:56:42,588
I have no idea, nothing's happening up here.

850
00:56:42,588 --> 00:56:44,588
But I... I will continue to work hard.

851
00:56:44,588 --> 00:56:48,588
Thank you so much for a not-birthday birthday this year.

852
00:56:48,588 --> 00:56:50,088
It was a little different for Baebry...

853
00:56:50,088 --> 00:56:52,588
...but I guess that's the end of Baebry.

854
00:56:52,588 --> 00:56:54,588
What was Baebry? Who knows.

855
00:56:54,588 --> 00:56:57,088
