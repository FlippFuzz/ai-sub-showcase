00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,333
Mermaid pose?

69
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:19,533

70
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:21,533

71
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,233

00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:31,533
Oh, the worm!

74
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:33,233
I'm gonna break my entire body...

75
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,833

76
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:35,833
Cartwheel please!

77
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:37,033

00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,233
Dab. There we go.

79
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:41,033
Anyway, thank you, that was your minute.

80
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,033
I hope you guys are satisfied with that.

81
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:44,033
I tried my best.

82
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:46,533
Thank you management, thank you. Alright!

83
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:49,033
Today we have so many things prepared.

84
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,833
I've got a lot of songs...

85
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,333
...maybe some dances...

86
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:56,533
...and...

87
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,033
...I've got a game.

88
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:01,033
My brain kind of... I've had so much caffeine, guys, my brain is like not working.

89
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:02,533
We have a game...

90
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:04,533
...and I hope you're ready to have some fun!

91
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:07,533
But for a game, I need people to play games with.

92
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:10,533
Because unless, you know, as you can see...

93
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:12,533
...I'm kind of alone here in my cage...

94
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:14,533
...so I really need some friends to play with.

95
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:17,533
So... oh! What's that? Wait, what?

96
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:21,033
I think some people are entering the gates of the Fun Zone!

97
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,533
What? Guess who could they be? I wonder.

98

Everyone has a mascot that will be driving along the board in their own go-karts.

138
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,533

まずルール説明します。
First, I'll explain the rules.

143
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,033

重い、重い、重い！
It's heavy, heavy, heavy!

149
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:51,533
Big dice!

150

You can collect cheese by playing mini-games or by completing a lap...

157
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:21,013
...and when the game is over, the player with the most pieces of cheese is the winner.

00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:25,878
話聞いてません。
You guys aren't listening.

161
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:27,898
子供たちがはしゃぎすぎてて。
The kids are way too excited.

162
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:33,328
And whoever has the fewest pieces of cheese, the least amount of cheese...

163
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:35,478
...has to do a punishment challenge!

164
00:10:35,478 --> 00:10:37,478
罰ゲーム！罰ゲーム！
Punishment game! Punishment game!

165
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:39,978
そう、みんなもね、頑張ってね。
So everyone, do your best, okay?

166
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:41,478
はい！おー！
Yes! Yay!

167
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:44,678
So we have four different spaces that you can land on.

168
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,278
The first space is called a Battle Space.

169
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,478
バトルスペース！バトルスペース！
Battle Space! Battle Space!

170
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:53,478
If you land on this space, you have to compete with the other players in a battle!

171
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:55,978
バトル！バトル！
Battle! Battle!

172
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:59,478
And the number of players will change depending on what kind of game it is.

173
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:03,478
Second kind of space is a Baelz Challenge Space!

174
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:06,278
ベールズチャレンジ！
Baelz Challenge!

175
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:08,978
このスペースは、僕とチャレンジ！
On this space, a challenge with me!

176
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:10,978
You'll be competing against me.

177
00:11:10,978 --> 00:11:14,478
The winner will gain two pieces of cheese, loser will lose two pieces of cheese.

178
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:17,278
おお！なるほど！
Oh! I see!

179
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:19,978
Next space is Cheese Space!

180
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:22,278
チーズスペース！
Cheese Space!

181
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:25,978
Very simple, if you land on a blue cheese space, you gain one piece of cheese.

182
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:29,278
If you land on a red cheese space, you lose one piece of cheese.

183
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:31,478
えー！デンジャー！
What! Danger!

184
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:33,478
青色のチーズは+1チーズ、赤色はデンジャーですよ。
Blue cheese is +1 cheese, red is danger.

185
00:11:33,478 --> 00:11:35,478
デンジャー！
Danger!

186
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:38,678
で、最後、and the most interesting space...
And finally, the most interesting space...

187
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:41,478
Chaos Space!

188
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:43,478
カオススペース！
Chaos Space!

189
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:45,978
No Chaos! Yes Chaos! Yes Chaos!

190
00:11:45,978 --> 00:11:48,278
嘘だろ！？カオス！？
Are you kidding me!? Chaos!?

191
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:50,978
嘘だろ、ノー！
No way, no!

192
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:54,478
I'm so excited to see someone land on this because...

193
00:11:54,478 --> 00:11:56,978
I have no idea what will happen.

194
00:11:56,978 --> 00:12:00,478
このカオススペース、何が起こるか全然わからない。
I have no idea what will happen in this Chaos Space.

195
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:04,978
なんでだよ！用意したついでに！
Why not! Even though you prepared it!

196
00:12:04,978 --> 00:12:07,978
いやいや、これこそ楽しさですよ。
No no, this is the fun of it.

197
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,978
なるほどね。
I see.

198
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:14,978
まあ、早速、オーダーを決めましょう。
Well then, let's decide the order right away.

199
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:17,978
オーダー！ダイスオーダー！
Order! Dice order!

200
00:12:17,978 --> 00:12:20,978
We have to decide the turn, so...

205
00:12:29,478 --> 00:12:31,278

00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:32,978
オッケー！イエーイ！
Okay! Yay!

207
00:12:33,678 --> 00:12:38,678
Time to play Rat Trap!

208
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:42,478
はい、そら先輩どうぞ。
Okay, Sora-senpai, go ahead.

209
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:46,978
ぬるっと始まりましたね。そうですね。
It started so suddenly. Yeah.

210
00:12:47,478 --> 00:12:50,478
スタート！レッツゴー！
Start! Let's go!

211
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,478
おお！1！

00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:55,478
1マス！
1 space!

213
00:12:56,478 --> 00:12:59,478
ドンマイ！どんまいですね。
Don't mind! Don't mind.

214
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:02,978
ゴーゴーゴー！

可愛いですね。ドライビング。行きます行きます。
How cute. Driving. Go, go, go.

217
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:14,978
1はどんなスペースかな？何があるんですか？
What kind of space is 1? What's on it?

218
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:18,478
おお、バトル！バトルスペース！
Oh, battle! Battle space!

219
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:22,478
バトル！ワット・バトル？
Battle! What battle?

220
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:25,478
So we have the first mini-game.

221
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:33,478
The first mini-game is Pose and a Phrase... (Explaining the rules)

222
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:36,478
なるほど！
I see!

223
00:13:36,478 --> 00:13:39,278
So, そら先輩 versus フブキ先輩。

224
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,478
おー！

00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:44,478
Make a pose, say a one-liner...

で、どっちがもっと上手く表情できるか。
And who can make a better expression.

00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:57,478
得意な分野かな、キューティーとか。
My specialty, maybe? Like cutie?

231
00:13:57,478 --> 00:14:00,478
キュートかクールか、セクシー、アングリー。
Cute, cool, sexy, or angry?

232
00:14:00,478 --> 00:14:03,478

Freestyle dance, music!

318
00:18:03,936 --> 00:18:07,436
ベールズ、フリースタイル全然できないよ。マジでフリースタイルできない。
Baelz, I can't do freestyle at all. Seriously, I can't.

319
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:12,436
じゃあ、これはでも一緒に踊ってもいいんじゃない？一緒に踊ろう！
Well then, maybe it's okay to dance together? Let's dance together!

00:18:12,436 --> 00:18:14,936
Together danceしよう。一緒にダンスして。

323
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:28,436
で、白上とそらちゃんが、どっちのダンスが魅力的だったかね、二人が勝者を決めます。
And Fubuki and Sora-chan will decide whose dance was more charming. You two decide the winner.

324
00:18:29,436 --> 00:18:31,436
はい、じゃあ行きます。音楽お願いします！
Okay, here we go. Music, please!

326
00:18:48,436 --> 00:18:50,436
ちょっと正面向いてやりなよ。
Hey, face the front!

327
00:18:50,436 --> 00:18:53,436
二人で一緒に。
Both of you together.

328
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,436
これはちょっと too difficult チャレンジだよね。
This was a bit of a too difficult challenge, wasn't it?

329
00:19:00,436 --> 00:19:01,936
そうだよね。
Right.

330
00:19:01,936 --> 00:19:04,936
そらちゃん、どうだった、これ？
Sora-chan, what did you think of this?

331
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,936
一緒に踊っちゃってるんだよね、でも。
But they ended up dancing together.

332
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:12,436
ちょっと、これはもう勝負にならなかったということで。
Wait, this didn't even turn into a match.

333
00:19:13,436 --> 00:19:14,936
二人とも負けだよ！
You both lose!

334
00:19:15,436 --> 00:19:17,436
ねえ、そらちゃん、これ。チーズまた戻ってる。
Right, Sora-chan? The cheese is going back.

Eh, what, minus 2!?

338
00:19:25,936 --> 00:19:29,436
僕らのせいじゃないですよ！あんなに楽しく踊ったのに。
It's not our fault! We had so much fun dancing.

339
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:33,936
あんなに楽しかったのに、負けたよ。ということで、チーズの借金ですか？
Even though it was so fun, we lost. So, it's a cheese debt?

340
00:19:35,436 --> 00:19:38,936
チーズ借金！チーズ借金！
Cheese debt! Cheese debt!

341

467
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,900
ベジマイトってどんなの？
What's Vegemite like?

468
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,400
Did you try Vegemite?

469
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,900
Smell it, smell it first.

470
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,300
二人ともまだ食べたことないんで。
Both of them haven't eaten it yet.

471
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,400
なんだろう…なんか…

Tasty!

473
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,900
お、でもなんだろう。匂いだけだとそこまで。
Oh, but what is it? Just from the smell, it's not that bad.

474
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,400
Like a miso.

475
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
ミソ？
Miso?

476
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
It's a world-famous Vegemite.

休憩…休憩フードみたいな。
It's like... a snack break food.

482
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,900
いいな、ベジマイト食べてみたい。お腹空いた。
Nice, I want to try Vegemite. I'm hungry.

483
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,300
味噌汁だ味噌汁。Like a miso soup.
It's miso soup, miso soup. Like a miso soup.

484
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,400
You're making miso soup in your mouth.

485
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,400

00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,900
What happens if I land on my land on my land on...

489
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,400
うわ、それどこまで行く？
Whoa, how far are you going?

Goodbye Hakos! Bye-bye!

502
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,400
マイナス二つということは、元々マイナス二つだから…
Minus two means, since it was minus two to begin with...

503
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
マイナス四！うわあ！
Minus four! Whoa!

Now Loading

710
00:42:12,976 --> 00:42:15,255
Baby, the rat is finally 3D!

711
00:42:15,755 --> 00:42:18,755
Yeah, hi! Let's chu chu chu!

712
00:42:19,055 --> 00:42:22,655
Here we roll dice, here we cast dice, and we just play dice.

713
00:42:22,755 --> 00:42:25,655
Baby, baby, there's no need to think twice, nani nani no!

714
00:42:25,755 --> 00:42:29,155
Make your night, make your vibe, make your spotlight.

715
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,855
Get up from that hands up and let's roll your life.

Baby, so simple, it's irrelevant,

719
00:42:46,755 --> 00:42:49,055
everyone born on the order when you ripped and tumbled

720
00:42:49,055 --> 00:42:52,655
but we have no time to complain 'cause I for sure can do it all over again.

721
00:42:52,755 --> 00:42:56,055
If we can laugh it doesn't matter where or when.

722
00:42:56,255 --> 00:42:59,055
BG to hammer, physics don't play the dice, so let's travel, search, and prize.

723
00:42:59,255 --> 00:43:02,055
Be limits bound, rule the chance, 意味なんてなああい
Be limits bound, rule the chance, there's no meaning at all!

724
00:43:02,255 --> 00:43:05,555
So we don't give a chu! 嫌なことソッコーミュート
So we don't give a chu! Immediately mute the bad things

So find something new, grateful, shh, now, a kiss

726
00:43:12,655 --> 00:43:18,055
No cage can trap this rat! Bae! No cage can trap this rat! Bae!

727
00:43:18,755 --> 00:43:22,055
Here we roll dice, here we cast dice, and we just play dice.

728
00:43:22,055 --> 00:43:25,255
Down the stream, come on out, don't be too nice, nani nani no!

729
00:43:25,255 --> 00:43:28,755
Follow your heart, follow your feels, so come and join the club.

730
00:43:28,755 --> 00:43:31,755
Go and scream for you're the one that's finally 3D!

731
00:43:31,755 --> 00:43:35,055
転がすダイスはそのままでいい
Keep the rolling dice as they are

732
00:43:35,255 --> 00:43:38,655

735
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:56,755
Now let me recite to you the only thing that will hold true

736
00:43:56,755 --> 00:44:00,055
YOLO is my ninja way, it's time to put those moves on display

737
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:03,455
Why stress about tomorrow when you've got today

738
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,755
Beyond the heart, 今はさ、行こうよ最高になんて誰も知らない
Beyond the heart, right now, let's go, nobody knows the absolute best

739
00:44:06,755 --> 00:44:09,755
人生 総勢 忠誠、マジで、短あああい
Life, all, loyalty, it's seriously short!

740
00:44:09,755 --> 00:44:13,555
One, and we see it as two, 負けてえぐい級
One, and we see it as two, losing is on a gross level

741
00:44:13,755 --> 00:44:17,455
The rat's on the route, 花火、発射、まるで電波
The rat's on the route, fireworks, launch, just like radio waves

742
00:44:20,755 --> 00:44:26,055
No math can settle this rat! Bae! No math can settle this rat! Bae!

743
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:30,055
Here we roll dice, here we cast dice, and we just play dice.

744
00:44:30,255 --> 00:44:33,455
Come and venture into my world upside down, nani nani no!

745
00:44:33,455 --> 00:44:36,755
Time to run and follow us, won't stop till we're done

746
00:44:36,755 --> 00:44:39,755
Idiots are allowed in infinite fun!

747
00:44:39,755 --> 00:44:43,055
みんな自由じゃなきゃもったいないじゃん
It's a waste if everyone isn't free

748
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:46,255
It's time to light our change and just be bigger!

749
00:44:46,255 --> 00:44:47,755
Don't you hesitate on what's ahead of you

750
00:44:47,755 --> 00:44:49,455
That's the game or else you are screwed

751

泣いて笑い果てましょう、チュー、チュー、チュー
Let's cry and laugh to the end, chu, chu, chu

Here we roll, here we cast, here we just Play Dice!

754
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,800
Baby, baby, there's no need to think twice.
