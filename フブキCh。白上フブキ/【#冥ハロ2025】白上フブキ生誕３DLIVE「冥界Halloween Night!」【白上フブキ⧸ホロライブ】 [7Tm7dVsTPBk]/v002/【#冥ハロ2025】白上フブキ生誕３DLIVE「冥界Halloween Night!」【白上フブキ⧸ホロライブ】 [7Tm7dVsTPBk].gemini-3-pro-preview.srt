00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,300
始まりはきっと
It surely began with

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,000
一つの願い
a single wish.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
それを抱いて私は
Embracing that,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,500
生まれた
I was born.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,200
孤独な夜空
In the lonely night sky,

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,400
震える指先で
with trembling fingertips,

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,000
点と点を繋げよう
let's connect the dots.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Wow wow...

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
一次元では
In the first dimension,

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
寂しすぎるから
it's too lonely, so

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,500
私たちは
we sought

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,000
広がりを求めた
to expand.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
点は線となり
Points became lines,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
線は立体となり
lines became 3D shapes,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
そこに距離が生まれたけれど
but distance was born there.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
三次元では
In the third dimension,

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,500
ちょっと
it's a little

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
遠すぎるから
too far apart, so

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,500
私たちは
we sought

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,000
平面に求めた
a flat plane.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
点は線となり
Points became lines,

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
線は星座となり
lines became constellations,

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
この夜空を繋ぐよ
connecting this night sky.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
自分らしく
A place where I can

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
居られる場所を
be myself...

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
気付けばずっと
I realized I had always

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
探していた
been searching for it.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
煌めく星を
Tracing the twinkling stars

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
辿り鉄の上
on this railway,

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
この未開拓を
making this frontier

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
目印に
my landmark.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
雨のち君がいつも
You were always there

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,500
そこにいたから
after the rain,

35
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,500
嬉しくて続けたんだ
so I happily kept going

36
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
今日まで
until today.

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
忘れないでね
Please don't forget,

38
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,000
僕らの星座は
our constellation was

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
君がいたから生まれた
born because you were here.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Wow wow...

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
例え君がいつの
Even if you live

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,500
時を生きては
in any era,

43
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,000
何かを好きになる気持ち
please cherish and keep singing

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,500
大切に歌い続けてね
the feeling of falling in love with something.

45
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,000
僕らの星座は
Our constellation

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
君がいるから生まれ
is born because you are here,

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
夜空に輝き
shining in the night sky,

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
明日へと繋がる
connecting to tomorrow.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Wow wow...

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
未来を目指すよ
We'll aim for the future.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
共に行こう
Let's go together.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
これは僕らのキセキ、
This is our miracle.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
僕とキミと、大切なあの子の
Of me, you, and that precious girl.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
この王国で過ごす、かけがえのない日々を綴る
Weaving the irreplaceable days spent in this kingdom,

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
僕たちの物語
this is our story.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
僕の居る意味はどこにあるの？
Where is the meaning of my existence?

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
誰かに必要とされたかった
I wanted to be needed by someone.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
夢や希望も捨てきれないけど
I can't fully give up on dreams and hopes, but

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
なんとなく今を生きている
I'm just somehow living in the now.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
なんとなく今を生きている
I'm just somehow living in the now.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
ああ どれだけ叫んでも
Ah, no matter how much I scream,

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
この声は君には届かない
this voice won't reach you.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
ああ どれだけ叫んでも
Ah, no matter how much I scream,

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
この声は君には届かない
this voice won't reach you.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
金木犀の匂いがした
I smelled the fragrant olive.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
明日のことも忘れたくなった
I wanted to forget about tomorrow too.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
いっそ逃げてしまおうかな
Maybe I should just run away.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
僕は悲劇の主人公だ
I am the protagonist of a tragedy.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,500
優しいヒトで居たいな
I want to be a kind person.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
でもそんな思いも偽善だ
But even that thought is hypocrisy.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
誰も幸せにできないの
I can't make anyone happy.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
都合良いね、涙が出るの
How convenient, tears are falling.

73
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:06,208
どれだけ歌っても
No matter how much I sing,

74
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:10,708
この声は君には届かない
this voice will not reach you.

75
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:14,608
ああ どれだけ歌っても
Ah, no matter how much I sing,

76
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:19,208
この声は君には届かない
this voice will not reach you.

77
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,108
ああ 息が苦しくなる
Ah, it becomes hard to breathe.

78
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:28,308
この歌もいつしか終わりが来る
This song too will eventually come to an end.

79
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:32,008
ああ 息が苦しくなる
Ah, it becomes hard to breathe.

80
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:37,308
この地球もいつかは終わりが来る
This planet too will eventually come to an end.

81
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:50,008
金木犀の匂いをまた
The scent of osmanthus again...

82
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:52,508
思い出した
...I remembered.

83
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:10,208
気付けば駆け出していた
Before I knew it, I was running,

84
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:13,408
揺れ動く心のままに
following my wavering heart.

85
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,808
遠ざかる白い壁
The receding white walls,

86
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:20,808
一度も振り返らずに
without looking back even once.

87
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:25,208
命が消え逝く季節の
Of the season when life fades away,

88
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:28,408
胸を刺す気配の中で
in the presence that pierces my chest.

89
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:32,008
迫りくる暗い闇
The approaching dark darkness,

90
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:35,708
二度と明けないような気がして
feeling like it will never dawn again.

91
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,708
転がり落ちそうな心
My heart that seems about to roll down,

92
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,108
必死に抱き止めていた
I was desperately holding it back.

93
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:48,008
星空へと続く長い坂道は
The long slope leading to the starry sky...

94
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,208
永遠にも思えたから
...seemed like it would last forever.

95
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:57,208
咲く花や散りぬるを
Blooming flowers and falling ones,

96
00:06:57,608 --> 00:07:00,208
神代の時より繰り返す
repeating since the age of gods.

97
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:03,808
私はそれを美しいとは
I have never thought...

98
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:07,108
思ったことがない
...that that is beautiful.

99
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:11,808
絶えず久方の春の陽を
Constantly, the eternal spring sunlight,

100
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:15,308
仮初の影が奪い合う
temporary shadows snatch from each other.

101
00:07:16,108 --> 00:07:18,808
その営みを美しいとは
I have never thought...

102
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:22,108
思ったことがない
...that that cycle is beautiful.

103
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:27,208
諦めながら生きてた
I lived while giving up,

104
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:29,508
何も望まないように
trying not to wish for anything,

105
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:30,908
それでも
but still...

106
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:33,508
手放せなかった
...I couldn't let go.

107
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:35,208
最後の願いを
Clutching the last wish,

108
00:07:35,308 --> 00:07:38,508
握りしめて駆け上がる
I run up the slope.

109
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,508
我武者羅に生きるお前が笑われて
You, living recklessly, are laughed at,

110
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:26,108
楽に生きる奴が得をする世界で
in a world where those who live easily gain.

111
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:30,108
我だけはお前のことを笑わない
Only I will not laugh at you!

112
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:34,808
皆が指差し笑おうとも我は笑わない
Even if everyone points and laughs, I will not laugh!

113
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:40,708
ああ 人は滅んでゆく ほころんでゆく
Ah, people perish, they come apart.

114
00:09:41,108 --> 00:09:44,208
才を妬み合い 富を奪い合い
Envying talent, stealing wealth.

115
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:48,108
ああ 人は滅んでゆく ほころんでゆく
Ah, people perish, they come apart.

116
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:50,508
その果てに見えた海は
The sea seen at the end of that...

117
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:53,508
地獄だろうか それとも地獄だろうか
is it hell? Or is it hell?

118
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,608
我武者羅に生きるお前が笑われて
You, living recklessly, are laughed at,

119
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:01,208
楽に生きる奴が得をする世界で
in a world where those who live easily gain.

120
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:05,208
我だけはお前のことを笑わない
Only I will not laugh at you!

121
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:08,016
皆が指差し笑おうとも我は笑わない！
Even if everyone points and laughs, I won't laugh!

122
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:09,316
我は笑わない
I won't laugh.

123
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:12,316
正直に生きるお前が貶されて
You, who live honestly, are disparaged,

124
00:10:13,316 --> 00:10:16,616
嘘で生きる奴らが徳となる世界で
In a world where those who live by lies profit,

125
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,616
我だけはお前の腕を離さない！
I alone will not let go of your arm!

126
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:22,816
時を刻み忘れようとも我は離さない
Even if time forgets to tick, I won't let go.

127
00:10:23,316 --> 00:10:24,816
我は離さない！
I won't let go!

128
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:27,316
我は忘れない！
I won't forget!

129
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:46,316
身を粉にして働いても
Even if you work yourself to the bone,

130
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:50,816
感謝されないことも... (シバシバ)
And aren't thanked for it... (often).

131
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:54,616
自己犠牲を受け入れても
Even if you accept self-sacrifice,

132
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:57,316
限界がもうやってくるから
Your limit is already approaching,

133
00:10:57,816 --> 00:11:00,316
自分を大事に愛せばいい
So you should just cherish and love yourself.

134
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:04,316
それは他人を愛すること
That is what it truly means to love others.

135
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:07,816
嗚呼 人は病んでゆく
Ah, people fall into illness,

136
00:11:07,816 --> 00:11:10,316
損なってゆく
Losing themselves,

137
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:12,616
塵に戻ってゆく
Returning to dust.

138
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:15,316
嗚呼 人は老いてゆく
Ah, people grow old,

139
00:11:15,316 --> 00:11:17,616
救われてゆく
Being saved.

140
00:11:17,816 --> 00:11:19,316
君に逢えたから...
Because I met you...

141
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:21,016
君を愛したから...
Because I loved you...

142
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:23,616
君が闘うなら...
If you fight...

143
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,316
僕も闘うから...
I will fight too...

144
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,816
我武者羅に生きるお前が笑われて
You, living earnestly, are laughed at,

145
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:39,816
楽に生きる奴らが徳をする世界で
In a world where those who live easy lives profit,

146
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:42,816
我だけはお前のことを笑わない！
I alone will not laugh at you!

147
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:47,316
皆が指差し笑おうとも我は笑わない！
Even if everyone points and laughs, I won't laugh!

148
00:11:47,816 --> 00:11:50,816
正直に生きるお前が貶されて
You, who live honestly, are disparaged,

149
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:54,816
嘘で生きる奴らが徳となる世界で
In a world where those who live by lies profit,

150
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:58,316
我だけはお前の腕を離さない！
I alone will not let go of your arm!

151
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,316
時を刻み忘れようとも我は離さない
Even if time forgets to tick, I won't let go.

152
00:12:01,816 --> 00:12:03,316
我は離さない！
I won't let go!

153
00:12:03,316 --> 00:12:05,316
我は忘れない！
I won't forget!

154
00:12:35,316 --> 00:12:39,316
それじゃあ今夜は、この王国のお話をしていこう。
Well then, tonight let's talk about this kingdom.

155
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:41,816
嘘か真か、
Truth or lie,

156
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:47,316
ここに記されている本は内容がコロコロと変わってしまう、不思議な本でね
the book recorded here is a mysterious one whose contents change constantly.

157
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:52,316
さて、今回はどんなお話になっているかな。
Now, I wonder what kind of story it has become this time.

158
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:06,316
これはあるサーカスの団が王国へ訪れ、
This is a story about a circus troupe visiting a kingdom,

159
00:13:06,816 --> 00:13:12,316
まだ未熟な座長さんが、綺羅びやかなステージに包まれたお話
and an immature ringmaster enveloped by a glittering stage.

160
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:20,316
あぁ...これが私が望んだ夢のエンディング！
Ah... this is the dream ending I wished for!

161
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,616
さあ、今日も始まりました〜！
Come on, it's started again today!

162
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:58,816
煌びやか、享楽のパレード
A glittering, hedonistic parade.

163
00:13:58,816 --> 00:14:00,316
常識もここじゃ無関係
Common sense is irrelevant here.

164
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:02,016
踊れ歌え騒げ全て忘れて
Dance, sing, make noise, forget everything!

165
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:03,816
細かいことは置いといて
Put the little details aside,

166
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:05,616
とりあえず身を任せてみな
just give yourself over to it for now.

167
00:14:05,616 --> 00:14:07,316
幸福を少し分けるような
Like sharing a little bit of happiness...

168
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:09,316
饗宴 Show Time!
A feast, Show Time!

169
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:17,816
積もりゆく不安や後悔
Piling anxiety and regrets,

170
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,616
今だけはちょっと目を背けて
turn your eyes away just for now.

171
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:21,316
そのままじゃ楽しめないじゃん
You can't enjoy it like that.

172
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:23,316
この場だけは何もかもを忘れて！
Forget absolutely everything just for this moment!

173
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:25,316
幾千の価値観全部
All the thousands of values,

174
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:26,816
引っ括め楽しませてあげる
I'll bundle them up and entertain you.

175
00:14:26,816 --> 00:14:28,616
百鬼夜行もビックリの
Surprising even the Night Parade of One Hundred Demons,

176
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:29,816
隊を成している
forming a corps.

177
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:31,816
怪奇模した喜劇が幕開け
A comedy mimicking the bizarre opens its curtains.

もう間もなく主役の登場、
The main act will appear very soon,

00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:40,816
一時でも目を離さないで！

眩しいほどのステージが始まる
A dazzling stage is about to begin.

184

想像して
Imagine,

185

この空間が世界で一番
This space is the number one in the world,

188
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:51,616
娯楽の名に相応しいんだ！
worthy of the name of entertainment!

189
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:53,816
割れんばかりの歓声と拍手で
With cheers and applause that could crack the air,

190
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:55,316
ショーは回っていく
the show goes on.

191
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:58,816
まあ、これはあくまで理想の話なんですが
Well, this is just an ideal story, though.

192
00:15:13,304 --> 00:15:14,704
さて今日も始めましょうか…
Well then, shall we begin today as well?

193
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:16,304
あ〜、またやっちゃった〜
Ah, I did it again~

194
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:19,904
実際はご覧の通り、まだまだ未熟な見習いなんです
As you can see, I'm actually still an inexperienced apprentice.

195
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:22,804
先人に憧れ持って、私もと飛び込んだものの
Admiring my predecessors, I jumped in too, but...

196
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:25,904
現実はそんな簡単に、上手くいかないなあ…
Reality isn't that simple, things don't go that smoothly...

197

もう一回！怪奇模した喜劇が幕開け

え？既にそれさっき見た？
Eh? You already saw that just now?

200
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:34,004
なら、飽き性なあなたにも朗報
Then, good news for you who gets bored easily.

201
00:15:34,104 --> 00:15:35,504
ちょっと前の模倣をするだけ
I'll just imitate what happened a moment ago.

202
00:15:35,504 --> 00:15:36,904
繰り返しじゃつまらない！
Repetition is boring!

203
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,304
だから、ここから先は趣向を変えてみよう！
So, let's change things up from here on out!

204
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:10,604
ドタバタなサーカスの行方は
Where this slapstick circus is headed...

205
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:12,704
誰にも自分すらも分からない
No one knows, not even me.

206
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:15,904
私を選んだ君だけでも楽しんでってよ〜〜〜損させないから
At least you who chose me, enjoy yourself! I won't let you down.

207
00:16:16,104 --> 00:16:18,904
いつの日か皆と楽しめるショーがしたいんだよな〜！
Someday I want to put on a show that everyone can enjoy!

208
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:22,604
だからこそ、こんなとこで挫けるわけとかな〜い！
That's why there's no way I can give up here!

209
00:16:25,104 --> 00:16:26,804
言葉なんかじゃ言い表せない
Words aren't enough to express it,

210
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:28,304
あの感動を私もいつか…
that excitement, someday I too...

211
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:30,304
とても偉大なこのステージに
Whether I'm worthy of this great stage,

212
00:16:30,304 --> 00:16:32,004
見合っているか分かんないけれど
I don't know yet, but...

213
00:16:32,104 --> 00:16:33,704
観客全て、私の色で
I'll dye the entire audience in my color,

216
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:39,104
創造しよう
Let's create it,

217
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:40,904
華々しいスポットライトの中
amidst the brilliant spotlight.

218
00:16:41,104 --> 00:16:42,904
目を奪うような妙技の数々
A myriad of eye-catching feats.

219
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:44,304
この空間が世界で一番
This space is the one most worthy

220
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,004
“娯楽”の名に相応しいんだ！

この王国へいらっしゃった時のお話
came to visit this kingdom.

226
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:39,504
まだみんな彼女の事を知らない頃だったので
Since it was back when no one knew her yet,

227
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:44,104
国民の大半は、アホの子なんて言ってたけど
most of the citizens called her a 'foolish child', but...

228
00:17:44,904 --> 00:17:47,304
とっても心優しくそして気さくで
She was a very kind-hearted, friendly,

229
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:50,604
頼りになるお姫様だったんだよ
and reliable princess.

230

ですわー！
It is so!

236

一生遊んでイージーモード
Playing around my whole life in easy mode,

237
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,104
って思ったら勝手にどうぞ！
if that's what you think, go right ahead!

238
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,604
世間はいつも風向き次第
The world is always changing like the wind.

239
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:30,104
有象無象ばかりでホント
Truly full of riff-raff everywhere.

240
00:18:30,904 --> 00:18:32,604

傷ついたのこの世界に
I was hurt by the fact that this world

242
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:38,104
血も涙もないこと
has no blood or tears.

243
00:18:39,104 --> 00:18:41,104
あれもダメ これもダメ それもダメ どれもダメ
That's no good, this is no good, that's no good, nothing is good.

244
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:43,604
現実は世知辛い
Reality is tough.

245
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:46,604
全部改変ですね…
It's all getting rewritten, isn't it...

246

I have to enjoy it sparklingly!

254
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,104

Being a marionette,

00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,304
ごめんだわ まったく
I refuse, honestly.

262
00:19:33,604 --> 00:19:35,104
上品な顔してても
Even with an elegant face,

263
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:38,304
黒幕はあの人かも
the mastermind might be that person.

264
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:40,104
まずはあたしが
First, I have to,

265
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:41,604
