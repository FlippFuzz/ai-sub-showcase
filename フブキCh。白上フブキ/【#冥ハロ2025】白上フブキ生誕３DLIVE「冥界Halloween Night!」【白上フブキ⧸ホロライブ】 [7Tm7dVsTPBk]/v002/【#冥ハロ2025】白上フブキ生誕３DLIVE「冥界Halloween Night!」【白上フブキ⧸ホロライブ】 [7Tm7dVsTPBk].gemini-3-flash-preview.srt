00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,500
始まりはきっと
It all surely began with

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,900
一つの願い
a single wish.

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,150
それを抱いて私は
Holding onto that,

5
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,400
生まれた
I was born.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
孤独な夜空
In the lonely night sky,

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,400
震える指で
with trembling fingers,

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,000
点と点を繋げよう
let's connect the dots.

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,000
1次元では寂しすぎるから
Because one dimension is just too lonely,

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,800
私たちは広がりを求めた
we sought out breadth.

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,000
点は線となり
Dots became lines,

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,100
線は立体となり
lines became solids,

13
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,100
そこに距離が生まれた
and distance was born.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,500
けれど
But,

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,500
3次元ではちょっと遠すぎるから
because three dimensions are a bit too far,

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,500
私たちは平面に求めた
we looked to the surface.

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,800
点は線となり
Dots became lines,

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,000
線は星座となり
lines became constellations,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
この夜空を繋ぐよ
connecting this night sky.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,800
自分らしくいられる場所を
A place where I can be myself,

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,000
気づけばずっと探していた
I realized I'd been searching for it all along.

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,000
煌めく星よ その理に集え
O sparkling stars, gather in that order,

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
この旗を目印に
with this flag as your guide.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
あの日君がいつもそこにいたから
Because you were always there that day,

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
嬉しくて 続けられたんだ
I was so happy, I could keep going.

26
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,500
今日まで
Until today.

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,800
忘れないでね 僕らの星座は
Don't forget, our constellation

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,000
君がいたから生まれた
was born because you were here.

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,800
たとえ君がいつの時を生きても
No matter what era you live in,

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,000
何かを好きになる気持ち
the feeling of coming to love something...

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,500
大切に歌い続けてね 僕らの星座は
Please keep singing it with care. Our constellation

32
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500
君がいるから生まれた
was born because you are here.

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,500
夜空に輝き 明日へと繋がる
Shining in the night sky, connecting to tomorrow.

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,800
未来を目指すよ
I'll aim for the future.

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,000
共に行こう
Let's go together.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,500
これは僕らのキセキ、
This is our miracle,

37
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
僕とキミと、大切なあの子の
mine, yours, and that precious girl's,

38
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,500
この王国で過ごす、かけがえのない日々を綴る
chronicling the irreplaceable days spent in this kingdom.

39
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
僕たちの物語。
Our story.

40
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,000
小説「FBKINGDOM STORY」ED主題歌抜粋
Novel 'FBKINGDOM STORY' ED Theme Song Excerpt

41
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,000
僕の居る意味はどこにあるの？
Where is the meaning for me being here?

42
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,500
誰かに必要とされたかった
I wanted to be needed by someone.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,800
夢や希望も捨てきれないけど
I can't quite throw away my dreams and hopes,

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,500
なんとなく今を生きている
but somehow, I'm living in the now.

45
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,500
あぁ どれだけ叫んでも
Ah, no matter how much I scream,

46
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,800
この声は君には届かない
this voice won't reach you.

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,500
金木犀の匂いがした
There was the scent of fragrant olives.

48
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,500
明日のことも忘れたくなった
It made me want to forget about tomorrow.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
いっそ逃げてしまおうかな
Maybe I should just run away instead.

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,500
僕は悲劇の主人公だ
I'm the protagonist of a tragedy.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,500
やさしいヒトで居たいな
I want to be a kind person.

52
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,800
でもそんな思いも偽善だ
But even that thought is hypocrisy.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,800
誰も幸せにできないの
I can't make anyone happy.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
都合良いね、涙が出るの
How convenient, tears are falling.

55
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:05,458
どれだけ歌っても
No matter how much I sing

56
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:10,508
この声は君には届かない
This voice won't reach you

57
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:13,258
どれだけ歌っても
No matter how much I sing

58
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:18,308
この声は君には届かない
This voice won't reach you

59
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:23,058
息が苦しくなる
It's getting hard to breathe

60
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:28,158
この歌もいつしか終わりが来る
This song too, will one day come to an end

61
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:31,858
息が苦しくなる
It's getting hard to breathe

62
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:36,908
この星もいつかは終わりが来る
This world too, will one day come to an end

63
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:49,358
金木犀の匂いをまた
The scent of gold osmanthus again...

64
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,058
思い出した
I remembered

65
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,008
In the dust, amidst the wintry wind,

66
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:02,908
the shadow of the girl...

67
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:06,008
suddenly, the prologue begins.

68
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,458
気付けば…　駆けだしていた…
Before I knew it... I was running...

69
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,158
揺れ動く…　心のままに…
Following... my wavering heart...

70
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:17,008
遠ざかる…　白い壁…
Receding... the white wall...

71
00:06:17,808 --> 00:06:20,658
一度も…　振り返らずに…
Without... ever looking back...

72
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,508
《生命》が…　消え逝く季節の…
In the season... where "Life" fades away...

73
00:06:25,258 --> 00:06:28,408
胸を刺す…　気配の中で…
In the air... that stings my chest...

74
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:32,158
迫りくる…　暗い闇…
Approaching... the dark gloom...

75
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,858
二度と…　明けなないような気がして…
Feeling as if... it will never dawn again...

76
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:39,558
転がり落ちそうな心
A heart that feels like it might tumble down

77
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:43,258
必死に抱きとめていた…
I was desperately holding on...

78
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:47,308
星空へと続く長い坂道は
The long slope leading to the starry sky

79
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:51,208
永遠にも…　思えたから…
Because it felt... like eternity...

80
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:56,208
咲く花や…　散りぬるを…
Flowers blooming... and withering away...

81
00:06:57,008 --> 00:07:00,208
神代の《時代》より繰り返す…
Repeating since the age of the gods...

82
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:04,008
私はそれを…　美しいとは…
I have never... thought that...

83
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,158
思ったことがない…
to be beautiful...

84
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:11,108
久方の…　春の陽を…
The long-awaited... spring sun...

85
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,158
仮初めの影が奪い合う…
Fleeting shadows fighting over it...

86
00:07:15,908 --> 00:07:18,858
その営みを…　美しいとは…
I have never... thought that...

87
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:22,158
思ったことがない…
to be beautiful...

88
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:26,058
諦めながら…　生きてた…
I lived... while giving up...

89
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:30,008
何も望まないように…　それでも…
Trying not to wish for anything... And yet...

90
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:34,008
手放せなかった…　最後の願いを…
I couldn't let go... of my last wish...

91
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:38,158
握りしめて…　駆け上がる
Clutching it tight... I run up

92
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:22,408
我武者羅に生きるお前が笑われて
You, living recklessly, are laughed at

93
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:25,758
楽に生きる奴らが徳をする世界で？
In a world where those who live easily gain merit?

94
00:09:26,008 --> 00:09:29,458
我だけはお前のことを笑わない！
I alone will not laugh at you!

95
00:09:29,658 --> 00:09:33,908
皆が指差し笑おうとも我は笑わない！
Even if everyone points and laughs, I will not!

96
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:38,858
ああ人は滅んでゆく
Ah, people are perishing

97
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,458
綻んでゆく
They are coming apart

98
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:43,858
才を妬み合い　富を奪い合い
Envying talent, snatching wealth

99
00:09:44,158 --> 00:09:45,608
ああ人は滅んでゆく
Ah, people are perishing

100
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,308
綻んでゆく
They are coming apart

101
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:50,358
その果てに見えた海は
The sea seen at the end of that

102
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:53,658
地獄だろうか？ それとも地獄だろうか？
Is it hell? Or is it hell?

103
00:09:54,058 --> 00:09:57,458
我武者羅に生きるお前が笑われて
You, living recklessly, are laughed at

104
00:09:57,558 --> 00:10:00,758
楽に生きる奴らが徳をする世界で？
In a world where those who live easily gain merit?

105
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:04,508
我だけはお前のことを笑わない！
I alone will not laugh at you!

106
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:08,816
皆が指差し笑おうとも我は笑わない！
Even if everyone points and laughs, I won't laugh!

107
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,316
正直に生きるお前が貶なされて
You who live honestly are disparaged,

108
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:16,316
嘘で生きる奴らが徳となる世界で
In a world where those who live by lies prosper,

109
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:19,316
我だけはお前の腕を離さない！
I alone will not let go of your arm!

110
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:22,816
時を刻み忘れようとも我は離さない！
Even if time forgets to tick, I won't let go!

111
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:26,816
我は忘れない！
I will not forget!

112
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:47,316
身を粉にして働いても
Even if I work myself to the bone,

113
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:51,316
感謝されないことも…
There are times I'm not thanked...

114
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:54,816
「自己犠牲」を受け容れても
Even if I accept "self-sacrifice",

115
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:57,816
限界がもうやってくるから
The limit is already approaching,

116
00:10:57,816 --> 00:11:01,316
自分を大事に愛せばいい
So it's fine to treasure and love yourself.

117
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:04,816
それは他人を愛すること
That is loving others.

118
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:07,816
ああ人は滅んでゆく
Ah, people are perishing.

119
00:11:07,816 --> 00:11:10,316
綻んでゆく
Coming apart.

120
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:13,316
元に今戻ってゆく
Now returning to how it was.

121
00:11:13,316 --> 00:11:15,316
ああ人は泳いでゆく
Ah, people are swimming.

122
00:11:15,316 --> 00:11:17,816
救われてゆく
Being saved.

123
00:11:17,816 --> 00:11:20,316
君に逢えたから…
Because I met you...

124
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:21,816
君を愛したから
Because I loved you.

125
00:11:21,816 --> 00:11:23,816
君が闘うなら…
If you fight...

126
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,316
僕も闘うから…
I will fight too...

127
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,816
我武者羅に生きるお前が笑われて
You who live recklessly are laughed at,

128
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:39,316
楽に生きる奴らが徳をする世界で
In a world where those who live easily benefit,

129
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:42,316
我だけはお前のことを笑わない！
I alone will not laugh at you!

130
00:11:42,316 --> 00:11:46,316
皆が指差し笑おうとも我は笑わない！
Even if everyone points and laughs, I won't laugh!

131
00:11:47,316 --> 00:11:50,816
正直に生きるお前が貶なされて
You who live honestly are disparaged,

132
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:54,816
嘘で生きる奴らが徳となる世界で
In a world where those who live by lies prosper,

133
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:58,316
我だけはお前の腕を離さない！
I alone will not let go of your arm!

134
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:01,316
時を刻み忘れようとも我は離さない！
Even if time forgets to tick, I won't let go!

135
00:12:01,316 --> 00:12:04,816
我は忘れない！
I will not forget!

136
00:12:34,816 --> 00:12:39,816
それじゃあ今夜は、この王国のお話をしていこう。
Well then, tonight, I'll tell you a story of this kingdom.

137
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:47,816
嘘か真か、ここに記されている本は内容がコロコロと変わってしまう、不思議な本でね。
Whether true or false, the book written here is a mysterious one whose contents change rapidly.

138
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:53,316
さて、今回はどんなお話になっているかな。
Now, I wonder what kind of story it's turned into this time.

139
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:07,316
これはあるサーカスの一団が王国へ訪れ、
This is a story of a circus troupe that visited the kingdom,

140
00:13:07,316 --> 00:13:13,316
まだ未熟な座長さんが、煌びやかなステージに包まれたお話。
And a still-inexperienced ringmaster who was enveloped in a brilliant stage.

141
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:20,316
あぁ… これが私が望んだ夢のエンディング！
Ah... this is the dream ending I wanted!

142
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:57,816
さあ、今日も始まりました～！
Now, it's started again today~!

143
00:13:57,816 --> 00:14:01,316
煌びやか、尊楽のパレード
Brilliant, a parade of noble music

144
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:05,316
常識もここじゃ無関係 踊れ歌え騒げ全て忘れて
Common sense is irrelevant here. Dance, sing, make a fuss, forget everything

145
00:14:05,816 --> 00:14:08,816
細かいことは置いといて
Put the details aside for now

146
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:11,816
とりあえず身を任せてみな
Just try leaving yourself to it

147
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:15,316
幸福を少し分けるような饗宴
A banquet that shares a little happiness

148
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:16,316
Show Time!

149
00:14:16,316 --> 00:14:19,316
積もりゆく不安や後悔
Accumulating anxieties and regrets

150
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,816
今だけはちょっと目を背けて
Just for now, turn your eyes away a bit

151
00:14:22,816 --> 00:14:25,816
そのままじゃ楽しめないじゃん この場だけは何もかも忘れて！
You can't enjoy it like that! Forget everything just in this place!

152
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:29,816
幾千の価値観全部 引っ括め楽しませたげる！
I'll make you enjoy all those thousands of values altogether!

153
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:33,316
百鬼夜行もビックリの隊を成している
Forming a troupe that would even surprise the Pandemonium

154
00:14:33,316 --> 00:14:36,816
怪奇模した喜劇が幕開け
A comedy imitating the bizarre opens its curtains

155
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:39,816
一目見ればたちまち虜に！？
A single glance and you're instantly a captive!?

156
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:43,316
どんな愛も受け入れてくれる ここだけはあなたの理想郷
Accepting any kind of love, only here is your utopia

157
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:46,816
「もう間もなく主役の登場、一時でも目を離さないで！」
"The main character is appearing shortly, don't take your eyes off for even a moment!"

158
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:50,816
眩いほどのステージが始まる
A blindingly bright stage begins

159
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:54,816
華々しいスポットライトの中 目を奪うような妙技の数々
In the brilliant spotlight, many dazzling feats of skill

160
00:14:54,816 --> 00:14:58,816
この空間が世界で一番 “娯楽”の名に相応しいんだ！
This space is the most suitable for the name "entertainment" in the world!

161
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:02,316
割れんばかりの歓声と拍手でショーは終わっていく
The show ends with thunderous cheers and applause

162
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:06,316
「まあ、これはあくまで理想の話なんですが^^;」
"Well, this is just an ideal story though ^^;"

163
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:14,304
さて、今日も始めましょうか...
Well then, shall we begin today as well...

164
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:16,104
あ〜、またやっちゃった〜！
Ah~, I did it again!

165
00:15:16,104 --> 00:15:19,004
実際はご覧の通り　まだまだ未熟な見習いなんです
In reality, as you can see,
I'm still just a clumsy apprentice.

166
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:23,104
先人に憧れ持って　私も！と飛び込んだものの
Looking up to my predecessors,
I dived in thinking, "Me too!"

167
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:26,204
現実はそんな簡単に　上手くいかないなあ…
But reality isn't that easy,
it's just not going well...

168
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:29,904
もう一回！　怪奇模した喜劇が幕開け　一目見ればたちまち虜に！？
One more time!
The curtain rises on a comedy mimicking the strange.
One look and you're instantly captivated!?

169
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:33,504
え？既にそれさっき見た？なら、飽き性なあなたにも朗報
Eh? You've already seen that?
Then here's good news for you, who gets bored easily.

170
00:15:33,904 --> 00:15:35,404
Q.ちょっと前の模倣をするだけ
Q. Just mimicking what came before?

171
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:37,004
A.繰り返しじゃつまらない！
A. Repetition is boring!

172
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,204
だから、ここから先は趣向を変えてみよう！
So, let's try changing the presentation from here on!

173
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:12,504
ドタバタなサーカスの行方は　誰にも自分すらも分からない！？
The outcome of this slapstick circus...
No one knows, not even me!?

174
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:16,204
私を選んだ君だけでも楽しんでってよ〜〜〜！！！損させないから
Since you chose me, please enjoy yourself to the fullest!!!
I'll make it worth your while!

175
00:16:16,504 --> 00:16:19,404
いつの日か皆と楽しめる　ショーがしたいんだよな〜！
I want to put on a show
that everyone can enjoy one day!

176
00:16:19,504 --> 00:16:23,104
だからこそ、こんなとこで　挫けるわけとかかな〜い！
That's why I can't afford to give up in a place like this!

177
00:16:24,804 --> 00:16:28,204
言葉なんかじゃ言い表せない　あの感動を私もいつか…
That emotion that can't be put into words...
I hope to one day...

178
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:32,004
とても偉大なこのステージに　見合っているか分かんないけれど
I don't know if I'm worthy
of this grand stage yet, but...

179
00:16:32,204 --> 00:16:35,604
観客全て、私の色で　染め尽くしてやろう！
I'll dye every member of the audience in my own colors!

180
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:38,304
手始めに、今、眼の前の君たちからいくよ〜〜〜！！！
To start with, I'm coming for all of you right in front of me!!!

181
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:40,404
創造しよう
Let's create it!

182
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:42,204
華々しいスポットライトの中
Amidst the brilliant spotlights,

183
00:16:42,204 --> 00:16:44,104
目を奪うような妙技の数々
numerous eye-catching feats.

184
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,104
この瞬間が世界で一番　“娯楽”の名に相応しいんだ！
This moment is the most worthy in the world
of the name "entertainment"!

185
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:48,004
割れんばかりの歓声と拍手で
With thunderous cheers and applause,

186
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:49,104
ショーが終わっていく
the show comes to an end.

187
00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:52,604
ああ…これが私が望んだ夢のエンディング。
Ah... this is the dream ending I wished for.

188
00:17:30,304 --> 00:17:36,504
これは花の国のお姫様がこの王国へいらっしゃった時のお話
This is a story from when a princess from the Kingdom of Flowers
came to visit this kingdom.

189
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:45,404
まだみんな彼女の事を知らない頃だったので　国民の大半は、アホの子なんて言ってたけど、
Back then, before everyone knew who she was,
most of the citizens called her a bit of an airhead.

190
00:17:45,404 --> 00:17:51,704
とっても心優しくて気さくで頼りになるお姫様だったんだよ
But she was a very kind, friendly,
and reliable princess.

191
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:56,604
なんてったって、みこはお姫様なんだから！
Because after all, Miko is a princess!

192

一生姫プでイージーモード！って思ったら勝手にご存です！？
Easy mode with 'princess play' for life!
Who said you could decide that!?

198
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,004
世間はいっつも風向き次第
The world always goes where the wind blows.

199
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:30,904
有象無象ばかりでホント　人間不信になっちゃう
Full of nobodies, honestly,
it makes me lose faith in humanity.

200
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,404
気づいたのこの世界に　血も涙もないこと
I realized that this world
has neither blood nor tears.

00:18:38,404 --> 00:18:39,204
これもダメ
not this,

203
00:18:39,304 --> 00:18:40,204
それもダメ
not that either,

204
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:41,104
どれもダメ
none of it works.

205
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:44,304
現実は世知辛い
Reality is just bitter.

206
00:18:44,604 --> 00:18:47,404
全部改変ですわ…！
It's time for a total modification...!

207

改変して差し上げますわ！

216
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:27,204
だれ？だれ？だれ？だれ？　裏で糸を引いてるのはだれ？
Who? Who? Who? Who?
Who's the one pulling the strings behind the scenes?

217
00:19:27,704 --> 00:19:32,504
操り人形だなんて　ごめんだわ全く
Being a puppet...
I'm absolutely not interested.

00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:47,204
改革だ…　自分改革ですわ…！
It's a reformation...
A self-reformation, desu-wa...!

222
00:19:47,904 --> 00:19:50,704
そうよなんてったってお姫様
That's right, after all, I'm a princess.

223
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:53,704
あたしこそ最高権力者
I am the supreme ruler.

もう声は届かないので
The voice no longer reaches anyone, so

435
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:42,841
まるで透明になったみたいだわ
It's like I've become transparent

436
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:47,241
そうして誰もが知らぬふりをした
And so, everyone pretended not to know

437
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:51,641
何故なら世界が呪われているから
Because the world is cursed

438
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:58,141
『永遠』の呪いは解かれていた
The curse of "eternity" had been broken

439
00:34:58,241 --> 00:35:02,641
まるでふたりの方が狂ったみたいだわ
It's like the two of them were the ones who went mad

440
00:35:03,322 --> 00:35:06,622
そしていつか笑うように眠る
And one day, sleep as if smiling.

441
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:11,222
なぜなら二人は放たれているから
Because the two of us are set free.

442
00:35:11,622 --> 00:35:18,322
死んだ世界でただ二人だけが幸せだった
In a dead world, only the two of us were happy.

443
00:35:18,922 --> 00:35:20,722
さあ
Now.

444
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:17,222
さて、今日はこれくらいにしておきましょう。
Now, let's call it a day.

445
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:20,222
...そろそろ時間になりましたし。
...It's about that time.

446
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:23,722
え？どこへ向かうのかって？
Eh? You're asking where I'm headed?

447
00:36:25,222 --> 00:36:28,722
今日は何の日かご存知ないのですか？
Don't you know what day it is today?

448
00:36:29,222 --> 00:36:35,722
今日は、この王国の地下深くにある冥界でのハロウィンパーティーですよ！
Today is the Halloween party in the underworld, deep beneath this kingdom!

449
00:36:36,222 --> 00:36:40,222
死者と生者が楽しむ年に一度のお祭りです。
It's an annual festival where the dead and the living enjoy themselves.

450
00:36:40,722 --> 00:36:43,222
さあ、一緒に向かいましょう。
Now, let's head there together.

451
00:36:44,722 --> 00:36:46,722
でも、気を付けて。
But, be careful.

452
00:36:46,922 --> 00:36:50,222
パーティーとはいえ、死者が住まう冥界です。
Even if it's a party, it's the underworld where the dead reside.

453
00:36:50,722 --> 00:36:55,722
誰かの思念や死者たちによって奇妙なことが起こるかもしれません。
Strange things might happen due to someone's thoughts or the dead themselves.

454
00:36:56,222 --> 00:37:00,722
でも、決してそちらに耳を傾けすぎてはいけませんよ...
But you must never listen too closely to them...

455
00:37:01,222 --> 00:37:03,722
それでは、参りましょう。
Well then, let's go.

456
00:37:12,222 --> 00:37:13,722
蒼炎
Blue Flame

作詞・作曲：景乃

458
00:37:50,222 --> 00:37:52,722
誰かが言いました
Someone once said,

459
00:37:53,222 --> 00:37:56,722
激しく燃えるものほど
The more intensely something burns,

460
00:37:57,222 --> 00:38:00,222
煌めく引き換えに
In exchange for its sparkle,

461
00:38:00,722 --> 00:38:04,722
その身をすぐ焦がしきると
The sooner it burns itself out.

462
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:15,722
数ある燭台に
Upon the many candle holders,

463
00:38:16,222 --> 00:38:19,722
お好きな火を灯しましょう
Let's light the flame of your choice.

464
00:38:20,222 --> 00:38:23,222
期待と裏腹に
Contrary to expectations,

465
00:38:23,722 --> 00:38:27,722
燻ればお生憎様
If it smolders, my condolences.

466
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,222
ランランランラン
Ran ran ran ran.

467
00:38:29,522 --> 00:38:31,722
右手には錆びた時計
In my right hand, a rusted watch.

468
00:38:31,922 --> 00:38:32,722
ランランランラン
Ran ran ran ran.

469
00:38:32,922 --> 00:38:35,722
左には油の筒
In my left, a tube of oil.

470
00:38:35,922 --> 00:38:36,722
ランランランラン
Ran ran ran ran.

471
00:38:36,922 --> 00:38:42,722
絽のドレスを着飾って さあ
Dressed up in a silk gauze dress, now,

472
00:38:43,222 --> 00:38:50,222
激しく 儚く 蒼く燃ゆる花びら
Violently, fleetingly, blue-burning petals.

473
00:38:50,722 --> 00:38:57,722
瞬き ゆらめく 生を彩り照らせ
Twinkling and flickering, illuminate life with color.

474
00:38:58,222 --> 00:39:04,722
いずれ尽き果てる未来へと
Toward a future that will eventually run out.

475
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,722
ゆりかごの目の前で
In front of the cradle,

476
00:39:12,922 --> 00:39:16,722
遍く飛び交う銃弾
Bullets fly everywhere.

477
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:24,722
指だけ動かせば容易くその火は潰える
With just a movement of a finger, the flame easily dies out.

478
00:39:39,722 --> 00:39:46,722
仮初めの情熱で 焼け爛れた舌では
With a temporary passion, and a scorched and raw tongue,

479
00:39:47,222 --> 00:39:54,722
上手に喋ることができないようで
It seems I cannot speak well.

480
00:39:55,222 --> 00:40:01,722
喉元過ぎても 毒を孕ませて
Even after it's passed the throat, let it harbor poison,

481
00:40:01,922 --> 00:40:02,722
やがては腑を腐らせる
And eventually rot the guts.

482
00:40:02,677 --> 00:40:09,977
やがては腑を腐らせるでしょう
Eventually, it will rot your guts.

483
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:17,977
揺らぐ死と生の狭間
Between flickering life and death

484
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:22,877
焼ける心と歌う
Singing with a burning heart

485
00:40:22,877 --> 00:40:26,477
描いた最愛の終幕を
The beloved finale I drew

486
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:29,177
激しく 儚く
Intense, fleeting

487
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:33,077
青く燃ゆる花びら
Blue-burning petals

488
00:40:33,077 --> 00:40:37,877
瞬き ゆらめく
Twinkling and flickering

489
00:40:37,877 --> 00:40:41,177
生を彩り照らせ
Color and illuminate life

490
00:40:41,177 --> 00:40:48,677
いずれ尽き果てるその先へと
Towards what lies beyond exhaustion

491
00:41:05,477 --> 00:41:11,277
あちらの世界に引きずり込まれないうちに早く会場へ向かわないといけませんね。
We must hurry to the venue before we're dragged into that other world.

492
00:41:11,377 --> 00:41:13,777
気を付けてついてきてくださいね。
Please be careful and follow me.

493
00:41:13,777 --> 00:41:17,177
あまり深入りすると、おっと…
If you get too deep into it, oops...

494
00:41:17,677 --> 00:41:22,077
そうそう、知らないほうがきっと懸命ですよ。
That's right, it's probably for the best that you don't know.

495
00:41:22,577 --> 00:41:26,277
なんだかすっごく心地が良いよね。
It feels really good somehow, doesn't it?

496
00:41:43,677 --> 00:41:49,077
気づけば見知らぬ世界に立っていた
Before I knew it, I was standing in an unknown world

497
00:41:49,077 --> 00:41:54,477
何処かも分からず毎日毎日泣いていた
Not knowing where I was, I cried every single day

498
00:41:54,477 --> 00:41:55,977
なんて暇もなく
But there's no time for that!

499
00:41:55,977 --> 00:41:58,477
Happy Time おかしな面々が
Happy Time! Strange people

500
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:00,877
Happy Time おどけて転がるの
Happy Time! Playfully rolling around

501
00:42:00,877 --> 00:42:05,177
Happy Time その馬鹿馬鹿しさに希望も恐怖もなくなった
Happy Time! In that absurdity, hope and fear have vanished

502
00:42:05,677 --> 00:42:13,477
確かそうアタシには為すべき仕事愛の棲家
Indeed, for me, there is work to be done in this nest of love

503
00:42:13,677 --> 00:42:17,177
パンプキン ヘッドギア
Pumpkin, Headgear

504
00:42:17,177 --> 00:42:21,477
だけどなんかどーでもいい
But somehow, none of it matters

00:42:22,477 --> 00:42:25,177
さぁ始まった夢の夜だ
Now it's begun, this night of dreams

506
00:42:25,177 --> 00:42:27,977
音楽が響いて鳴り止まない
The music resonates and won't stop

507
00:42:27,977 --> 00:42:30,477
声を揃えて叫べ今日は
Raise your voices and shout today

508

510
00:42:35,877 --> 00:42:38,677
真面目に生きても割に合わない
Living seriously just doesn't pay off

511
00:42:38,677 --> 00:42:40,877
なんでもありさ なぜって今日は
Anything goes, because today is

出口はないんだって そう永遠に
There's no exit, they say, for eternity

515
00:42:48,777 --> 00:42:50,977

Gone, they're gone

無心でチェックし解答するけれど
I mindlessly check and answer

520
00:43:05,877 --> 00:43:07,677
本当にそうかな
But is it really true?

521
00:43:07,677 --> 00:43:10,377
Happy Life とりま音に乗せて
Happy Life! For now, ride the sound

522
00:43:10,377 --> 00:43:13,177
Happy Life デタラメに踊るの
Happy Life! Dance haphazardly

523
00:43:13,177 --> 00:43:17,877
Happy Life その繰り返しのなか懐疑心も失った
Happy Life! In that repetition, skepticism was lost too

おっと音声が乱れました
Oops, the audio got distorted

529
00:43:37,477 --> 00:43:40,177
お気になさらずに皆々様
Please don't mind it, everyone

530
00:43:40,177 --> 00:43:42,877
そんなお口は縫い合わせて
Let's sew up those mouths

Let's regain our composure and join in, everyone

I understood everything, everything

You'll be able to forget the sorrows of the transient world, right?

558
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:08,098
諸行無常 ちまたじゃ お化けよりも怖い人たち
All things are impermanent; in the streets, people are scarier than ghosts

増えすぎちゃってすぐに 1out, 2out, 3out ノックアウト
They've increased too much, so quickly it's 1out, 2out, 3out, knockout!

「迷える哀れな子羊たちよ」
“You poor, wandering lambs”

583
00:47:42,518 --> 00:47:46,018
「お菓子が欲しいかい？ それとも安らぎが欲しいかい？」
“Do you want candy? Or do you want peace?”

584
00:47:46,018 --> 00:47:49,518
永遠に求め続けるの？ それならばずっと苦しいままだ
Will you keep seeking forever? Then you'll remain in pain forever.

永遠に断ち切れない 呪いの鎖に囚われ
Trapped in a chain of curses that can never be broken

589
00:48:02,518 --> 00:48:06,518

Before you rot away completely

590
00:48:06,518 --> 00:48:10,518
脳みそちょっといじるだけで あら不思議
Just a little tinkering with the brain, and oh, look!

591

595
00:48:26,018 --> 00:48:29,518
あー怖かったなーなんて へたり込んで涙目で
Saying “Oh, that was scary,” collapsing with teary eyes

596

笑う顔見たいな
I want to see your smiling face

597

もう苦しまなくていいよ こんなに頑張ったんだから
You don't have to suffer anymore, because you've worked so hard

598

躊躇わずこっちにおいで
Don't hesitate, come over here

599
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:44,518
もっとずっと本能的に気持ち良いいだけの
Just something that's much more instinctively pleasant

600
00:48:44,518 --> 00:48:47,518
ゴールを見せてあげる
I'll show you the goal

601
00:48:47,518 --> 00:48:51,018
脳漿埋まってまで光るカタルシス
Catharsis that shines until the brain is buried

602
00:48:51,018 --> 00:48:54,518

この冥界ではこうして思念として漂っているんだね。
They drift as thoughts here in the underworld.

605
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:19,518
あまり深入りしてはいけないよ。こういうのが一番たちが悪い。
Don't delve too deeply. These things are the most troublesome.

606
00:49:19,718 --> 00:49:24,518
私はただ、あなたを愛していただけ。
I just... loved you.

607
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:38,518
物言わぬ唇に生気を吹き込んで
Blowing life into wordless lips

608
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:46,318
今宵「あなた」は甦る あの頃の姿で
Tonight, “you” shall be revived in your form from those days

誰も知らない場所で眠らせた。
And let her sleep in a place no one knows.

618

Is it eternal love?

622
00:50:43,326 --> 00:50:46,526
禁断の行為か。
Or a forbidden act?

623
00:50:46,526 --> 00:50:49,426
また逢いたいと願うだけ。
I only wish to meet again.

624
00:50:49,426 --> 00:50:52,426
それが罪なのでしょうか。
Is that a sin?

625
00:50:52,426 --> 00:50:55,426

726
00:58:00,614 --> 00:58:04,114
(ぜん！) 女王の私のお出ましです！ (おー！)

729
00:58:07,114 --> 00:58:10,114
私に見惚れちゃったら最後です♡
If you're entranced by me, it's the end. ♡

730
00:58:10,614 --> 00:58:13,614
鮮やかなステップ くるり舞ってワルツ
Vivid steps, turning and dancing a waltz,

731
00:58:13,614 --> 00:58:17,114
百鬼夜行のリズムに揺られて
swaying to the rhythm of the Night Parade.

732
00:58:17,114 --> 00:58:21,614
この楽しさ癖になるわ
This fun is becoming addictive.

733
00:58:21,614 --> 00:58:24,114
時間切れとか…
Running out of time...

734
00:58:24,114 --> 00:58:26,614
やだ！全然足りないってば！
No! I'm telling you, it's not enough at all!

735
00:58:26,614 --> 00:58:28,114
Let's 冥界 Halloween Night!!
Let's underworld Halloween Night!!

736
00:58:28,114 --> 00:58:31,114
Dancing! Dancing! 一夜の奇怪なメモリー
Dancing! Dancing! A strange memory of one night.

737
00:58:31,114 --> 00:58:34,614
ラッタッタ ラッタッタ 冥界 Halloween Night!
Rat-tat-ta, rat-tat-ta, underworld Halloween Night!

738
00:58:34,614 --> 00:58:38,114
Sweety! Sweety! おもむろに頬張るキャンディー
Sweety! Sweety! Slowly stuffing cheeks with candy.

739
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:41,114
ラッタッタ ラッタッタ あもっと頂戴！
Rat-tat-ta, rat-tat-ta, oh give me more!

740
00:58:42,114 --> 00:58:48,614
泡沫の夢 淡い霧の中溶けて
Fleeting dreams melting in the faint mist,

741
00:58:48,614 --> 00:58:54,114
青白い頬を 涙が伝った
tears trickled down pale cheeks.

742
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:58,114
この命は誰のため？自問自答の末
For whom is this life? At the end of self-reflection,

743
00:58:58,114 --> 00:59:04,614
禁断の箱 開けたら
once the forbidden box is opened...

744
00:59:05,614 --> 00:59:07,114
時間を戻す
Reverse time,

745
00:59:07,114 --> 00:59:10,114

746
00:59:13,814 --> 00:59:17,114
Dancing! Dancing! 闇夜にハッピーなメロディー

Swinging! Swinging! A spine-chilling and pleasant irony.

749
00:59:23,614 --> 00:59:27,114
ラッタッタ ラッタッタ 狂宴のショータイム!
Rat-tat-ta, rat-tat-ta, the showtime of the mad banquet!

750
00:59:27,114 --> 00:59:29,114
(パパパ) 恐ろしや
(Pa-pa-pa) How terrifying.

751
00:59:29,114 --> 00:59:30,114
(うらめしや) 恨めしや
(Urameshiya) How resentful.

752
00:59:30,114 --> 00:59:33,114
夢もお名前も忘れてる
Forgetting dreams and even names.

753
00:59:33,114 --> 00:59:33,814
おろろ？
Ororo?

754
00:59:33,814 --> 00:59:35,614
(パパパ) おいしそう

756
00:59:37,114 --> 00:59:39,614
Welcome! さあ、踊ろうよ
Welcome! Come on, let's dance.

757
00:59:39,614 --> 00:59:41,614
This is Halloween Night!!

758
01:00:02,495 --> 01:00:04,695
ハロウィンパーティー、いかがでしたでしょうか？
How was the Halloween party?

759
01:00:05,395 --> 01:00:08,695
ちゃんとこちら側の王国に戻って来られていますか？
Were you able to return to this kingdom safely?

760
01:00:09,695 --> 01:00:15,695
冥界の女王様に気に入られてしまうと、魂を奪われてしまって帰って来られませんからね。
If the Queen of the Underworld takes a liking to you, she'll steal your soul and you won't be able to come back.

761
01:00:17,195 --> 01:00:20,695
戻って来られてラッキーでした... なんて。
You were lucky to be able to return... just kidding.

762
01:00:21,695 --> 01:00:25,695
あ、今日のお話はどうでしたか？楽しかったでしょうか？
Ah, how were today's stories? Did you enjoy them?

763
01:00:26,695 --> 01:00:32,695
私が特にお気に入りは探偵のお話でして、今回お聞かせできてとても嬉しかったです。
My particular favorite was the detective story, and I'm very happy I could share it with you this time.

764
01:00:34,395 --> 01:00:37,695
そうだ、いつかあなたのお話も聞かせてくださいね。
That's right, please tell me your story someday, too.

765
01:00:38,695 --> 01:00:43,695
もしかすると、あの本にあなたのお話も書き記されるかもしれませんよ。
Perhaps your story will be recorded in that book as well.

766
01:00:44,695 --> 01:00:47,695
なんといっても、摩訶不思議な本ですから。
After all, it's a mysterious book.

767
01:00:48,695 --> 01:00:52,695
何が起こるか、司書である私にもわかりません。
Even I, the librarian, don't know what will happen.

768
01:00:54,195 --> 01:00:56,695
さて、そろそろお時間ですね。
Well, it's about time.

769
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:03,195
またお話が聞きたくなりましたら、いつでもこの王国図書館へお越しください。
If you ever want to hear a story again, please come to this Kingdom Library anytime.

770
01:01:04,695 --> 01:01:06,695
それでは、さようなら。
Well then, goodbye.

771
01:01:18,695 --> 01:01:22,195
ハジマリはきっとひとつの願い
The beginning was surely a single wish

772
01:01:22,195 --> 01:01:26,195
それを抱いて私は生まれた
I was born holding onto it

773
01:01:26,695 --> 01:01:29,195
孤独な夜空
In the lonely night sky

774
01:01:29,195 --> 01:01:32,195
震える指で 点と点をつなげよう
With trembling fingers, let's connect the dots

775
01:01:36,195 --> 01:01:41,195
LIVE Blu-ray 発売決定！
LIVE Blu-ray Release Decided!

776
01:01:41,695 --> 01:01:44,195

Say! Fanfare! 行きますよー！
Say! Fanfare! Here we go!

778
01:01:47,195 --> 01:01:49,695
Say! ほらどの顔あげて
Say! Look, lift up your face

779
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:52,195
みんなで手をとれば
If we all hold hands

780
01:01:52,195 --> 01:01:54,695
High! まだまだ道半ば
High! We're still only halfway there

781
01:01:54,695 --> 01:01:57,695
世界を越えよう
Let's go beyond the world

782
01:01:58,195 --> 01:02:00,695
Say! ほら推し推しがまま
Say! Look, just as you like

783
01:02:00,695 --> 01:02:04,195
止まらない全力ですから
Because I'm going at full power without stopping

784
01:02:05,195 --> 01:02:07,195
夢を書き換えたら
If we rewrite our dreams

785
01:02:07,195 --> 01:02:09,695
追いかけ続けよう
Let's keep chasing them

786
01:02:09,695 --> 01:02:12,195
ともにつなぐファンファーレ Go!
The fanfare that connects us, Go!

787
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,695
Yeah!

788
01:02:15,195 --> 01:02:17,195
ハイ！ハイ！うーここ！
Yes! Yes! Woo, here!

789
01:02:18,695 --> 01:02:22,195
なかなか苦い姿 自分自身の
Quite a bitter sight, of myself

790
01:02:22,195 --> 01:02:25,195
輝きを見失った
When I lost sight of my brilliance

791
01:02:25,195 --> 01:02:27,695
時には思い出してね
Please remember

792
01:02:27,695 --> 01:02:30,195
僕らのステージは
Our stage

793
01:02:30,195 --> 01:02:32,695
君がいるから輝く
Shines because you are here

794
01:02:42,695 --> 01:02:44,695
Oh Yeah! 無数の星の中
Oh Yeah! Among countless stars

795
01:02:45,195 --> 01:02:48,195
Oh Yeah! 光を君がくれた
Oh Yeah! You gave me light

796
01:02:49,195 --> 01:02:50,695
Oh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah! もっと
Oh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah! More

797
01:02:51,195 --> 01:02:53,195
Oh Yeah! 越えて行けるさ
Oh Yeah! We can go beyond

798
01:02:53,195 --> 01:02:55,195
Oh Yeah! スーパーノバ起こせ今
Oh Yeah! Create a supernova now

799
01:02:55,195 --> 01:02:58,195
Oh Yeah! 何度だって飛べる
Oh Yeah! We can fly any number of times

800
01:02:58,195 --> 01:03:00,195
Oh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah! これは
Oh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah! This is

801
01:03:00,195 --> 01:03:02,695
まぎれもなく僕らの奇跡
None other than our miracle
