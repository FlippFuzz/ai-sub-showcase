6
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,500
ねえ その言葉に私にちょっと興味ないの
Hey, aren't you a little interested in those words of mine?

7
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,200
ああ そう じゃあいいか
Ah, I see. Then never mind.

8
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,300
私全部全部わかってたいの
I want to understand everything, every single thing.

9
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
ダメなよう？ そんなこと言われても
No good? Even if you say that...

10
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,400
意味わかんないじゃん
...it makes no sense.

11
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,500
五感現象 異常上昇
Sensation phenomenon, abnormal rise.

12
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,500
どこがいいの？なんてよく聞かれるけどさ
"What's so good about it?" They ask me often, but...

13
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,000
わからないでいいよ
It's fine if you don't understand.

14
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,500
愛に溢れて止まらないだけ
I'm just overflowing with love and can't stop.

15
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,800
ア・ア・ア・イ・エ・イ
A-a-a-i-e-i

16
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,000
つまらない どいつもこいつも
It's boring, everyone's the same,

17
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,000
飽きないの？
Don't you get tired?

18
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,500
さあ どうする ダーリン？
Now, what will you do, Darling?

19
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,500
おお もう絶対 僕にアイウエちゃってしょうがない
Ah, geez. You're definitely falling for me, it can't be helped.

20
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,400
いつもの継ぎ足し足しするのは忍びないけど
I feel bad about always just adding more to it, but...

21
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,500
行ったり
Going...

22
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,500
来たり
...and coming back.

23
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,100
泣き枯れちゃっても
If I cry myself dry,

24
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,300
困っちゃうし
I'll be in trouble.

25
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,800
いつまでたったって堪えらんないからさ
Because I can't bear it no matter how much time passes.

26
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,500
僕は今日も逃げるのさ
I'm running away again today.

27
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,500
フラフラ
Wandering around,

28
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,500
危険一髪 あなたは僕の運命の人
A close call. You're the one for me.

29
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,400
許してよ こんなのあんまりじゃーん！
Forgive me. This is just too much!

30
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,300
よそう 決めないで
Stop it. Don't decide,

31
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,600
選べないで
Don't choose.

32
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,000
僕は全部全部を愛していたいの
I want to love everything, every single thing.

33
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,800
最低だよ そんなこと言われても
That's the worst. Even if you say that,

34
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,400
別に十々承知
I'm well aware.

35
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,400
ラブソングに酔い酔い ほどほど
Drunk on love songs, in moderation.

36
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,300
何がダメなの？なんてよく聞かれるけどさ
"What's so bad about it?" They ask me often, but...

37
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,500
他人事もいいところ
It's none of my business.

38
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,500
愛に当たって砕けて立ち上がるだけ
Just hitting love head-on and picking myself back up.

39
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,400
奇想天外 何を言っているのかな？
Bizarre. What are you saying?

40
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,300
悔しであーらら言葉に言っちゃって
Regrettably, the words just come out.

41
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,600
アイノアジ チェリアジ ぜんぶだめね
The taste of love, the taste of cherry. It's all no good.

42
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,500
女の子面倒結構
Girls are such a bother.

43
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,000
百花繚乱 雪吹雪いても 天真爛漫 冷静になれど
Flowers blooming in profusion, even in a blizzard. Innocent and cheerful, even if I become calm.

44
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,833
...ンは等しくお利口なヤツらさ
...are equally clever guys.

45
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:05,833
銃半信半疑 飛ばして
Half-trusting, half-doubting guns, flying.

46
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:08,333
ご愛顧 お大事?
Your patronage, take care?

47
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,333
止めどない この愛の
This unstoppable love.

49
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:17,133
教えて 息づらして するくたして
Tell me, making it hard to breathe, making it...

50
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,733
知らないって 知らないって
"I don't know," "I don't know."

51
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:23,033
私もっと全部をわかっていたいの
I want to understand everything more.

52
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:26,133
ダメだよって そんなこと言われても
Even if I'm told "No, you can't."

53
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:28,333
意味わかんないじゃん
It doesn't make sense.

54
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:30,833
承諾事項 意向上昇
Agreed matters, rising intentions.

55
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:34,133
まったく どうしようもない君に
To you, who are absolutely hopeless.

56
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:39,133
天前を だらしないくらいがちょうどいい
Being pampered, just a bit slovenly is just right.

57
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:42,833
愛が溢れて溢れて止まらない
Love overflows and overflows, it won't stop.

58
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:46,733
バチバチもういい加減にして
Now, enough of this crackling.

心から 許さない
I won't forgive you from the heart.

64
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:09,433
一瞬でも 一秒でも 交差していたいたい
Even for a moment, even for a second,
I want our paths to cross.

65
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:12,933

Look at my room, guys! Whoa! So many weapons!

92
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:55,633
Because I am an ancient weapon.

00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:58,833
This is only befitting of an ancient weapon.

252
00:15:55,558 --> 00:15:57,518
いや、でも我々もね、色んな繋がりがありますから、ヘリとか。

253
00:15:57,518 --> 00:15:59,478
あ、そうだ!
Oh, that's right!

254
00:15:59,478 --> 00:16:01,558

ボカーンってやつね。
The 'kaboom' one.

00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:13,678
まあ、私ね、あの3Dお披露目で、やはり絵を描きたいんですよ。
Well, for my 3D showcase, I really want to draw.

259
00:16:13,678 --> 00:16:15,318

え、みこも描くー。
Eh, Miko wants to draw too!

262
00:16:18,598 --> 00:16:22,038
お、でも普通に絵を描くのがね、ちょっとつまんないんじゃないですか。
But just drawing normally is a bit boring, isn't it?

263
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:26,078
ということで対決、対決したいと思って。
So I thought we should have a battle.

264
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:27,518
いいんですか? みこと。
Is that okay? With Miko?

265
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:30,638
みこ先輩、そう、噂によるとね、絵が上手いので。
Miko-senpai, yeah, I heard rumors you're good at drawing.

266
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:36,758
まあそれはまあ確かに、JPの中では中の下ぐらいの...
Well, certainly, among JP members, I'm around lower-middle...

267
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:39,238
まあ上手いよね、エリートだから。何でもできるし。
Well, I'm good. I'm an elite, I can do anything.

268
00:16:39,238 --> 00:16:41,358
じゃあこの後見るか? うん、みこのやつ。
Wanna see it later then? My drawing.

00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:43,158
そう、でも、まだね、あの、まだまだゲストがいます。

00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:25,398
Yay! So cute!

282
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:28,398
でね、この後、まあイラスト、まあ絵の対決やるんですけど。
So, after this, we're doing a drawing battle.

283
00:17:28,398 --> 00:17:31,958
まあね、あの、スタッフさんからね、あの、お題ね、あの、もらったんですよ。
Well, you see, I got a prompt from the staff.

284
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:35,158
あー、いいじゃないですか、そのお題。
Oh, that sounds good, that prompt.

285
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:38,278
で、そのお題を描いて、で、ムメイとゼタと対決でございます。
So we'll draw that prompt and battle with Mumei and Zeta.

286
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:41,358
みこたちが描いて、それを当てるってことね。
So we draw it and they have to guess it.

287
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:43,478
そう、あーなるほどなるほど。
Right, I see, I see.

288
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:47,358
So what we will be doing is that staff thought of a prompt...

289
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,998
...and me and Miko-senpai have to draw them...

290
00:17:50,998 --> 00:17:55,558
...and Mumei and Zeta will be the ones guessing what prompt is it.

291
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:57,838
Okay! Yay! Let's go!

292
00:17:57,838 --> 00:18:00,838
We have one minute to draw. 1分。1分ね。
We have one minute to draw. One minute. One minute.

293
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:04,518
1分で。60秒。OK。描きましょ。
In one minute. 60 seconds. Okay. Let's draw.

294
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,358
忙しいね。
That's busy.

295
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:08,398
1分で描きましょ。
Let's draw in one minute.

296
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:10,078
これを使います。
We'll use these.

297
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:11,518
ドン、ドン。
Bam, bam.

298
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:14,398
Whoa! Canvases!

299
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:16,878
本格的ですね、アーニャさん。
This is very professional, Anya-san.

300
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:18,318
ね、これはいいですよ。
Right? This is good.

301
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:21,078
ここで座らせていただいて。よいしょっと。
Let's take a seat here. There we go.

302
00:18:23,398 --> 00:18:27,518
とりあえず、Mumei and Zeta, close your eyes, because we will be showing the prompt.
Anyway, Mumei and Zeta, close your eyes, because we will be showing the prompt.

303
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:30,038
見ないでね。見ないで。
Don't look. Don't look.

304
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:33,438
Close your eyes... 見ててね。
Close your eyes... Watch, okay?

305
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:35,878
何のお題かなー。
I wonder what the prompt is.

306
00:18:36,258 --> 00:18:40,958
あひるに告白するスバル
Subaru confessing to a duck

307
00:18:37,398 --> 00:18:38,438
あ!
Oh!

308
00:18:38,438 --> 00:18:41,158
あー、なるほどですね。
Ah, I see.

309
00:18:41,158 --> 00:18:44,038
あー、OK OK OK。
Ah, OK OK OK.

310
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:46,278
Can we take a peak?

311
00:18:46,278 --> 00:18:49,318
OK OK OK OK。
OK OK OK OK.

312
00:18:49,318 --> 00:18:51,998
でも1分なんだよな。
But it's only one minute.

313
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,598
1分だね。どうなるんかな。
One minute, huh. I wonder how it'll go.

314
00:18:54,598 --> 00:18:58,078
Okay, open your eyes, if you haven't.

315
00:18:58,078 --> 00:19:00,398
Okay! My eyes are open!

316
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:02,998
よし、じゃあ、始めますか。
Alright, then, shall we start?

317
00:19:02,998 --> 00:19:05,558
行きますか。
Shall we go?

318
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:07,558
Ready?

319
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:08,838
Ready?

320
00:19:08,838 --> 00:19:10,998
Ready!

321
00:19:10,998 --> 00:19:13,078
Set... Go!

322
00:19:13,078 --> 00:19:14,638
Okay! Okay!

323
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:16,478
始まりました。
It has begun.

324
00:19:16,478 --> 00:19:20,358
ここで今まで培ったものを全て...
I'll use everything I've cultivated until now...

325
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:23,358
Do you think one minute is enough to draw anything?

326
00:19:23,358 --> 00:19:25,038
No.

327
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,478
They will prevail.

328
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:29,438
え、どうやって描くんだったっけ?
Wait, how was I supposed to draw this?

329
00:19:29,438 --> 00:19:31,958
ちょっ...
Wait...

330
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:35,158
They have so much passion in their eyes.

331
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:37,598
みこはもう余裕ですけど、ちなみに。
I'm quite confident, by the way.

332
00:19:37,598 --> 00:19:39,238
お?
Oh?

333
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:42,198
We should be able to do this, Zeta.

334
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:45,158
Exactly. We should be able to figure this out.

335
00:19:45,158 --> 00:19:48,318
Can you? We can maybe figure it out based on their hand movements.

336
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:50,078
待って、手の動き?
Wait, hand movements?

337
00:19:50,078 --> 00:19:53,278
I think I know what it is.

338
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:55,238
You know what it is?

339
00:19:55,238 --> 00:20:00,038
I definitely know what it is based just on their movement.

340
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:02,571
Okay, um...

341
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:10,371
...it could be, I don't know, something related to their emotions maybe? I'm not too sure.

342
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:09,271
せめて...
At least...

343
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:11,071
これだけは伝わってほしい。
...I hope at least this gets through.

344
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:14,471
Oh, what do you think?

345
00:20:16,811 --> 00:20:18,571
これだけは...
At least this...

346
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:19,671
伝わって。
...get through.

347
00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:21,571
これだけは伝わってほしい。
I hope at least this gets through.

348
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:23,271
I guess you're right. It could be a variety of things.

349
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:27,071
ちょ... 待って。
Wai... Wait.

350
00:20:27,071 --> 00:20:28,691
ちょっと難しかった、これ。
This was a bit difficult.

351
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:30,271
いや、これは...
No, this is...

352
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:31,721
絵心だからね、あにゃ、これは。
It's about artistic spirit, Anya.

353
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:35,011
そうだね、絵心が伝わるかどうかだから。
Right, it's about whether the artistic spirit gets through.

354
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:37,071
せめて、あの...
At least, um...

355
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:39,021
まあ、誰かだけに伝わってほしいな。
Well, I hope at least one person gets it.

356
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:39,771
そうね。
Right.

357
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:40,771
OK, OK.

358
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:41,771
OK, OK.

359
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:43,771
誰か一人は100%。
Someone will get it 100%.

360
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:45,571
Let's show the show!

361
00:20:45,771 --> 00:20:46,571
うん。
Yeah.

362
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:47,571
OK?

363
00:20:47,571 --> 00:20:48,771
OK.

364
00:20:48,771 --> 00:20:50,771
OK, let's see Anya's!

365
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:51,971
Yes!

366
00:20:52,771 --> 00:20:54,271
ドン！
Ta-da!

367
00:20:57,271 --> 00:20:59,571
せめて誰かだけに伝わってほしい、これは。
I hope at least someone gets this.

368
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:03,571
もうなんなのよ、これ。
What even is this?

369
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:06,371
That's it?

370
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:09,271
Is that a duck? I was about to say it's a duck.

371
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:11,771
Mumei, what do you think that is? I can't tell.

372
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,571
This is my masterpiece!

373
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:15,071
It's very obvious!

374
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:16,571
Who is it, senpais?

375
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:19,271
OK, let's now see Miko's.

376
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:21,071
ドン！
Ta-da!

377
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:23,771
Oh, a platypus!

378
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:26,071
可愛んじゃねえか。
Isn't that cute.

379
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:28,471
可愛んじゃねえか、そんなのよりずっと。
Isn't that cute, much more than that one.

380
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:31,271
いやいやいや、伝わるよ、伝わるよ。
No, no, no, it'll get through, it'll get through.

381
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:34,271
いやいやいや、No, no, no, mine is better!
No, no, no, mine is better!

382
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:36,271
Are we doing the same thing? I guess we'll find out.

383
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:37,271
OK.

384
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:39,471
何を描いたかってとこが...
What we drew is...

385
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:39,471
Winner!

386
00:21:39,471 --> 00:21:40,771
Mumei-Zeta discussion time!

387
00:21:40,771 --> 00:21:43,771
What person do you guys think this is?

388
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:46,571
Mumei can go first.

389
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:53,771
All right. I think it is Subaru-senpai talking to a platypus.

390
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:57,771
OK. It does look like a platypus.

391
00:21:57,771 --> 00:22:02,271
I'm gonna say the same thing, except a duck maybe.

392
00:22:03,271 --> 00:22:04,771
Huh huh huh.

393
00:22:05,271 --> 00:22:08,771
シュバシュバ、シュバシュバ、シュバシュバ。
Shuba shuba, shuba shuba, shuba shuba.

394
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:10,371
果たして？
Really?

395
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,271
Is it wrong? Is it correct?

396
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:15,271
正解かどうかどうだ？
Is it correct or not?

397
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:17,071
Is that a platypus?

398
00:22:17,271 --> 00:22:18,571
Your answer?

399
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:19,671
Final answer?

400
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:23,271
A platypus, I guess. I'll go with a platypus.

401
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:24,771
Duck-platypus.

402
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:26,271
OK.

403
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:29,271
Yeah, platypus. Platypus is more likely. Let's just go with that.

404
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:32,071
正解はこちら！
The correct answer is here!

405
00:22:32,071 --> 00:22:33,671
そう、これむずいよな。
Yeah, this is hard.

406
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,771
正解は...
The correct answer is...

407
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,671
ドン！
Ta-da!

408
00:22:37,071 --> 00:22:38,571
正解は...
The correct answer is...

409
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:41,671
正解かどうかどうだ。
Is it correct or not?

410
00:22:42,271 --> 00:22:46,271
あひるに告白するスバル
Subaru confessing to a duck

411
00:22:44,371 --> 00:22:48,271
Confessing! Confessing to a duck!

412
00:22:46,071 --> 00:22:48,571
Confessing to a duck?

413
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:51,271
告白するスバル。
Subaru confessing.

414
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:54,571
みこさん、あひるしか見てなくて...
Miko-san, I was only looking at the duck...

415
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:56,071
あんま覚えてなくて。
...so I didn't remember well.

416
00:22:56,071 --> 00:22:57,771
あれ挨拶かな？
Was that a greeting?

417
00:22:57,771 --> 00:22:58,771
挨拶？
A greeting?

418
00:22:59,471 --> 00:23:02,071
なんか、私これ告白してるから...
Like, since I'm confessing here...

419
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:04,071
なんか心がハッピーになっちゃったんだけど。
...my heart just became happy.

420
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:05,271
あ、そういうことね。
Oh, I see.

421
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:06,771
Yeah, it's not a platypus!

422
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:08,671
圧があるよ、このスバルさん。
There's pressure in this Subaru-san.

423
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:11,271
It's not a platypus!

424
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:14,071
なんか圧が凄いのよね、私の。
Like, the pressure is amazing in mine.

425
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:15,571
うん。
Yeah.

426
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:17,271
ちょっと圧があるな。
It does have some pressure.

427
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,671
Yeah, my Subaru-senpai is definitely confessing to a duck.

428
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:21,771
That is a duck.

429
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:23,671
Interesting.

430
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:25,071
Interesting, interesting.

431
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:25,671
I know, right?

432
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,771
Well, Mumei...

433
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:30,771
...which art do you like the best out of these two?

434
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:33,771
一番好きなのはどれ？
Which one do you like best?

435
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:36,571
I have to go with Anya's...

436
00:23:36,571 --> 00:23:42,771
...because I just love the expression that you put on Subaru-senpai. It's so cute.

437
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:41,671
Anya's art is favorite!

438
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:45,971
やっぱ、やっぱね、絵心がね...
As expected, the artistic spirit...

439
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:47,571
もう恵まれてるって。
...is truly gifted.

440
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:49,571
絵心！
Artistic spirit!

441
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:49,671
絵心！
Artistic spirit!

442
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:51,271
恵まれてるって。
Is truly gifted.

443
00:23:51,271 --> 00:23:52,771
みこの方があるでしょ、あれ。
Miko's is more like it, right?

444
00:23:52,771 --> 00:23:56,471
だって、小物使いしてるし、ここ、見てこれ、小物。
Because I used accessories, look here, accessories.

445
00:23:57,271 --> 00:24:00,271
これやってほしいわ、昴先輩に。
I want Subaru-senpai to do this.

446
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:02,571
Yeah, thank you so much, Mumei.

447
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:04,271
What about you, Zeta?

448
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:07,771
OK, for me...

449
00:24:07,771 --> 00:24:10,571
...I would have to go with Miko-senpai.

450
00:24:10,571 --> 00:24:12,471
Look at that beautiful platypus.

451
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:14,771
でも可愛いよね、これ。
But it's cute, isn't it?

452
00:24:14,771 --> 00:24:16,271
ツンデレじゃね？
It's tsundere, right?

453
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:18,071
お前のこと好きだ、あ、そうそう。
"I like you," ah, right.

454
00:24:18,071 --> 00:24:19,771
別に、好きなんて... みたいな。
Like, "It's not like I like you..."

455
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:23,571
そう、別に好きなわけじゃないのよね。
Right, it's not like I like you.

456
00:24:23,771 --> 00:24:25,271
可愛、別に。
Cute, not really.

457
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:26,771
ツンデレ。
Tsundere.

458
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:28,771
Yeah, Subaru-senpai is confessing.

459
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:29,771
そうそうそう。
Right, right, right.

460
00:24:29,771 --> 00:24:30,771
可愛いよね。
Cute, isn't it?

461
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,471
Oh my god.

462
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:36,571
I thought it was Subaru-senpai scolding the duck.

463
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:38,771
You know what? I thought the same thing.

464
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:42,471
なんか、あひるに怒ってるみたいな、と思った。
I thought it was like she's scolding the duck.

465
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:44,271
ああ、ちょっとね。
Ah, a little bit.

466
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:46,571
そういう雰囲気あるよね。
It does have that vibe.

467
00:24:47,771 --> 00:24:49,571
まあ、確かにな。
Well, certainly.

468
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,271
スバちゃん素直じゃないから。
Suba-chan isn't honest with herself.

469
00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:52,771
ああ、なるほどね。
Ah, I see.

470
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:54,571
今日は恥ずかしがってるんだね。
She's being shy today.

471
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:56,071
だよね。
Right.

472
00:24:56,071 --> 00:24:57,771
やっぱ可愛いわ。
She's so cute.

473
00:24:55,271 --> 00:24:58,271
So cute, Subaru-senpai.

474
00:24:58,771 --> 00:25:00,771
Thank you so much, Zeta and Mumei, for joining us!

475
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:06,001
ありがとうございます！おめでとう！
Thank you so much! Congratulations!

476
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:08,001
ありがとう！3D！
Thank you! 3D!

477
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:12,167
バイバイ！
Bye-bye!

478
00:25:13,334 --> 00:25:15,951
あ、みこ先輩も、ありがとう、ありがとうございます。
Ah, Miko-senpai, thank you, thank you so much.

479
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:18,434
いや、こちらこそ、来させてくださって、ありがとうございます。
No, thank you for having me here.

480
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:20,401
いやあ、楽しかったね。
Man, that was fun.

481
00:25:20,401 --> 00:25:21,901
え、もう終わり？
Wait, it's over already?

482
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:24,984
え、じゃあさ、あの…え、うん。
Well, then... uh, yeah.

483
00:25:24,984 --> 00:25:28,151
やっぱそこら辺の武器、ちょっと後で持ち帰ってもいいすか？
Can I actually take some of those weapons home later?

484
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:31,201
それは…それは、アーニャさん…
That's... about that, Anya...

485
00:25:31,201 --> 00:25:33,367
それは、うー。検討します。
That's... uh, I'll consider it.

486
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:36,484
みこ先輩のために、まあ、ぬいぐるみあげたんじゃないですか。
I already gave you a plushie, didn't I?

487
00:25:36,484 --> 00:25:38,017
まだ欲しいんですか？
You still want more?

488
00:25:38,017 --> 00:25:39,451
いや、もらったけど…
Well, I did get it, but...

489
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:42,801
かっこいいよね、あれね！やば！
Those are so cool! Insane!

490
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:44,084
あ、憧れますよね。
Ah, they're quite alluring.

491
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,501
え、じゃあ、持ってるね。
Well then, I'll be waiting.

492
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:46,334
オッケー。
Okay.

493
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:47,551
うん、じゃあ頑張ってね。
Yeah, good luck!

494
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:48,334
オッケー。ありがとう。
Okay, thank you.

495
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:49,984
ありがとう。ありがとう。
Thank you. Thank you.

496
00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:52,384
この後も、頑張ります。やったー。
I'll keep doing my best. Yay!

497
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,184
バイバイ！みこ先輩！
Bye-bye! Miko-senpai!

498
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:57,317
バイバイ！バイバイ！
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

499
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:02,234
いやあ、でも、みこ先輩のイラスト、可愛いよね。
Man... but Miko-senpai's illustration is so cute.

500
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:05,534
ああ。楽しかったな、もう。
Ah, that was so much fun.

501
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:07,984
楽しかったね。
It was fun, wasn't it?

502
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:12,134
まだ、まだね、このお披露目はね、続きます。なんと。
This showcase is still... still going on, believe it or not.

503
00:26:14,334 --> 00:26:15,951
さてさて。
Now then.

504
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:22,084
Let's see what is next on our schedule.

505
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:23,201
え、え、何？
Eh, wait, what?

506
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:25,984
また？またコール？
Another one? Another call?

507
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,084
ハロー？ハロー？誰だ？
Hello? Hello? Who is it?

508
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:31,584
初めまして。
Nice to meet you.

509
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:34,067
え、わたくし、声優の鈴木みのりと申します。
I'm voice actress Minori Suzuki.

510
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:36,584
（驚きの声）
(Gasping in shock)

511
00:26:36,584 --> 00:26:39,584
え、アーニャさんがですね、プロジェクトセカイの…
So, I heard that Anya-san likes...

512
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:41,584
東雲絵名がお好きということで。
Ena Shinonome from Project Sekai.

513
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:47,884
え、こちらでご縁がありましてですね、今回ボイスコメントを送らせていただきたいと思います。
Since we have a connection here, I wanted to send a voice comment this time.

514
00:26:49,001 --> 00:26:53,917
まずは何より、3Dお披露目できて、おめでとうございます。
First and foremost, congratulations on your 3D showcase.

515
00:26:55,584 --> 00:26:59,184
確かに、私もね、まだこのコメントを撮っている時は…
To be honest, while I'm recording this message...

516
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:06,684
アーニャさんの可愛い、あの、イラストだったりとかね、ま、3Dじゃないものを拝見しておりますので。
I've only seen Anya-san's cute illustrations and non-3D forms.

517
00:27:07,734 --> 00:27:14,834
またこう進化してね、3Dのアーニャさんになったら、またどんな可愛さが増えてしまうんだという感じで。
So I'm wondering how much cuter she'll become once she's evolved into 3D Anya-san.

518
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:19,017
個人的にもワクワクしておりますが。
I'm personally very excited about it.

519
00:27:21,034 --> 00:27:29,084
えー、そうですね。アーニャさんがどんな人なんだろうっていうふうに、いろいろ調べていく中で、もちろんあのYouTubeの方も見させていただきましたが。
As I was researching what kind of person Anya-san is, I of course watched your YouTube videos.

520
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:36,901
あの、シャマという曲を歌っている動画が私、特に好きで。
I especially like the video where you're singing the song 'SHAMA'.

521
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:38,584
（激しい驚き）
(Intense shock)

522
00:27:38,584 --> 00:27:46,384
あの、アーニャさんの声、可愛らしいお声とシャマのあのキーもね、独特な綺麗なアーニャさんの裏声も聞けて。
I got to hear Anya-san's lovely voice, and your beautiful head voice in the key of 'SHAMA' was just unique.

523
00:27:46,384 --> 00:27:54,067
なんか、うっとりしちゃうというか。爽やかさと、可愛さと、かっこよさが、こう同時に楽しめちゃうアーニャさんの歌声に、一人感動しておりました。
It was enchanting. I was personally moved by Anya-san's singing voice, which lets me enjoy freshness, cuteness, and coolness all at once.

524
00:27:56,917 --> 00:28:04,384
ね。絵名をお好きと言ってくださっていて、なんかこう演じている身としても、絵名の頑張りが誰かに届いているんだなっていうのを実感できて。
You said you like Ena, and as her voice actress, knowing her hard work is reaching someone makes me feel so proud.

525
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:11,584
とっても嬉しく思っています。
It makes me very happy.

526
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:24,084
またぜひどこかで、3Dのアーニャさんとね、お会いできたらいいななんて、お話しできたらいいななんて、こっそり思ってます。
I secretly hope to meet and talk with the 3D Anya-san somewhere in the future.

527
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:31,184
ぜひこれからも頑張ってください。陰ながら応援しております。絵名のこともよろしくお願いします。
Please continue to do your best. I'll be supporting you. And please keep supporting Ena too.

528
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:34,067
以上、鈴木みのりでした。
That's all from Minori Suzuki.

529
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:39,784
これは！これはこの後ガチャ回すしかないんですよ！
This! I have no choice but to roll the gacha after this!

530
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,584
ありがとうございます！ありがとうございます！
Thank you! Thank you so much!

531
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:45,784
鈴木みのりさん、ありがとうございます！
Suzuki Minori-san, thank you very much!

532
00:28:45,784 --> 00:28:48,484
メッセージ、嬉しい。
The message... I'm so happy.

533
00:28:48,884 --> 00:28:50,584
嬉しい。
I'm so happy.

534
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:53,584
え？ありがとうございます。
Eh? Thank you.

535
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:56,784
Wait, what?

536
00:28:57,084 --> 00:28:58,767
What happened?

537
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:00,584
What just happened, everyone?

538
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:02,584
What just happened?

539
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:04,584
Who's that?
Who was that?

540
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:08,584
What was that?

541
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:12,084
Bro, I'm sorry, I'm sorry guys. I'm... I'm winning.

542
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,084
I'm winning too much today.

543
00:29:15,084 --> 00:29:18,584
You guys have to admit that I'm winning so much today.

544
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:21,384
It's not even funny.

545
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,584
Excuse me?

546
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:27,084
Who was that? I'm trying to process that.

547
00:29:28,084 --> 00:29:29,584
は？まだある？
Huh? There's more?

548
00:29:30,084 --> 00:29:31,584
ハロー？
Hello?

549
00:29:31,584 --> 00:29:35,584
やめてください、もう心が、心がもうぐちゃぐちゃになってます、わたくし。
Please stop, my heart... my heart is already a mess.

550
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:38,001
誰だ？
Who is it?

551
00:29:38,084 --> 00:29:39,834
アーニャさん、初めまして。
Anya-san, nice to meet you.

552
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:42,584
声優の佐倉綾音です。
I'm voice actress Ayane Sakura.

553
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:46,584
この度は、まず3Dお披露目おめでとうございます。
First of all, congratulations on your 3D showcase.

554
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:49,584
Holy... holy Yagoo...

555
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:51,501
Holy Yagoo...

556
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:58,384
というわけで、どうやら配信などで、私の名前をよく出してくださっていたというお話で。
So, I heard that you've been mentioning my name often in your streams.

557
00:29:58,584 --> 00:30:00,584
本当にありがとうございます。
Thank you so much.

558
00:30:01,897 --> 00:30:03,730
配信など聞かせていただいたんですけど、
I've listened to your streams and such,

559
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,363
えぇ、聞いてくれるの？
Eh, you listen to them?

560
00:30:05,363 --> 00:30:08,763
とっても可愛い声で「佐倉綾音さん」とか
with such a cute voice, calling me "Sakura Ayane-san" or

561
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:12,430
「あやねるさん」とか呼んでいただいていて、
"Ayaneru-san,"

562
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,997
あ、私も明日から
and I thought, "Ah, I'll be able to

563
00:30:14,997 --> 00:30:17,430
お仕事頑張れるなっていうふうに思いました。
work hard from tomorrow too."

564
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,430
わ！私も明日から仕事頑張ろ！
Whoa! I'll work hard from tomorrow too!

565
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,097
ありがとうございます。
Thank you very much.

566
00:30:22,097 --> 00:30:25,930
むしろこちらがありがとうございますという気持ちです。はい。
Actually, it's me who should be thanking you. Yes.

567
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,663
そうですね、アーニャさん。私、
So, Anya-san. I really love

568
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:31,930
ウエクラさんのイラストがとっても好きなのですが、
Uekura-san's illustrations,

569
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:36,930
そのウエクラさんがママなんですよね。
and Uekura-san is your "mama," right?

570
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,430
My mama is amazing, yes!

571
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,930
すっごい可愛いウエクラさんのイラストに
With a voice just as cute as

572
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,930
全然負けないとっても可愛い声で、
Uekura-san's lovely illustrations,

573
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,430
軽快なトーク、楽しい、
you've got this breezy talk—fun,

574
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:51,930
可愛いだけじゃない面白いトークをされていて、
not just cute but interesting,

575
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,430
おお、すごく素敵だなと思いました。
and I thought it was just wonderful.

576
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,430
日本語もめちゃくちゃお上手ですよね。
Your Japanese is incredibly good, too.

577
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,430
ていうか、バイリンガルっていうことになるんですか？
Or rather, you're bilingual, right?

578
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,430
すっげーカッコいい！
That's so cool!

579
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:07,430
私も二ヶ国語とか三ヶ国語とか喋りたくなったな。
It makes me want to speak two or three languages.

580
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,997
あー！その通りでございます。
Ah! That is correct.

581
00:31:09,997 --> 00:31:14,997
多分、私よりアーニャさんの方が日本語で喋るの上手だと思います。
I think you're actually better at Japanese than I am.

582
00:31:14,997 --> 00:31:16,430
いやいやいや、さすがに！
No way, that's going too far!

583
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,930
本当に、それぐらい思うほど
Seriously, I've been listening to

584
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,930
字幕とか全然なしにスムーズに配信を聞かせていただいて、
your streams smoothly without any subtitles,

585
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,430
とても楽しませていただきました。
and I've really enjoyed them.

586
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,930
あと一つ気になったのが、
One more thing I was curious about:

587
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,930
アーニャさんのホロライブの紹介ページ、あるじゃないですか。
your Hololive profile page.

588
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:36,430
そこの紹介欄に、
In the introduction section there,

589
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:40,930
「基本的に無感情で人間には特に興味がないです。」
"Basically emotionless and not particularly interested in humans."

590
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:44,930
「見た目で判断しないでください。」
"Please don't judge by appearances."

591
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:49,930
「愚かな人間どもはいつも見た目で判断しますよね。」って書いてあるんです。
"Foolish humans always judge by appearances, don't they?" is what it says.

592
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:54,430
これ、あはは、黒歴史っぽい...！
This, ahaha, sounds like a dark past...!

593
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:58,930
これは、私には興味持っていただいたんですよね。
So... you were interested in me, right?

594
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,930
え！もちろん！
Eh! Of course!

595
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,930
私が人間扱いされてないっていうことではないんですよね。
Wait, does that mean I'm not treated as a human?

596
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:07,930
いや女神ですよ、佐倉綾音さんは。
No, Sakura Ayane-san is a goddess.

597
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,930
ちょっとこれに関しては、アーニャさんの心を
In that regard, if I've been able to

598
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,930
もし少しでも開かせることができているんだったら、
open Anya-san's heart even a little,

599
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:19,430
とっても嬉しい、ありがたいことだなと思いながら読んでいました。
I read that thinking how happy and grateful I am.

600
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:23,930
人間っていいものです。
Humans are good things.

601
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,930
もう知ってるか。
But you probably know that.

602
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:30,930
多分、素敵な仲間とかリスナーさんに囲まれて知ってると思うんですけど。
Surrounded by wonderful friends and listeners.

603
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:36,930
これからもぜひ引き続き人間のことをよろしくお願いします。
Please continue to be kind to humans from now on.

604
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:41,930
何の話だ。というわけで、アーニャさん、改めて本当に3Dお披露目おめでとうございます！
What am I talking about? Anyway, Anya-san, congratulations on your 3D debut!

605
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,930
次はいつかはお喋りできる
Next time, if there's ever

606
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,930
タイミングが来たらその時を楽しみにしています。
a chance for us to talk, I'm looking forward to it.

607
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,897
というわけで、佐倉綾音でした。バイバイ！
Anyway, this was Sakura Ayane. Bye-bye!

608
00:32:49,897 --> 00:32:52,930
それ私ですね、多分死にます。
That's me, I'll probably die.

609
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,930
もう何百年も生きてるんですけど、多分一瞬で死にますね。
I've lived for hundreds of years, but I'll probably die in an instant.

610
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,897
ありがとうございます！
Thank you very much!

611
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:07,930
終わっちゃった... 終わっちゃった。
It's over... It's over.

612
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,930
Was that? Of every dream. Was that?

613
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,930
Guys!

614
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,930
Waduh, aku, aku, aku sudah...
Whoa, I, I, I'm already...

615
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:26,930
kepalaku sudah tidak bisa, tidak bisa berpikir ya guys, habis itu.
my head already can't, can't think anymore guys, after that.

616
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:31,930
Thank you so much! Thank you so much to Sakura Ayane-san and Suzuki Minori-san!

617
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:35,930
鈴木みのりさんも佐倉綾音さんもありがとうございます。
Suzuki Minori-san, Sakura Ayane-san, thank you very much.

618
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,930
もうマジで私の中で熱い声優さんのお二人でございます。
They are truly two voice actresses that I'm really passionate about.

619
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:45,930
本当にありがとうございます。ありがとうございます。ありがとうございます！
Thank you so very much. Thank you. Thank you!

620
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:52,930
まあということでね、あのお披露目は私の頭もぐちゃぐちゃになったんですけど、
So, this showcase has made my head all scrambled, but

621
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,930
まだ終わってません。終わってないです。
it's not over yet. It's not over.

622
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,930
まだまだあります！
There's still more!

623
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:03,930
After this, there's still a few more stuffs to show you guys.

624
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:07,930
Okay, let's go to the next live segment! See you there!

625
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,930
じゃあこの後のライブパートに移るから移動します。
Now, I'm moving on to the live part that's coming up next.

626
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:16,930
待っててください。
Please wait for it.

627
00:34:28,397 --> 00:34:30,930
Sudah jam berapa ini?
Wait, what time is it?

628
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:35,930
Aku terlambat untuk pergi kerja lagi.
I've been running late to work again.

629
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,930
Ya biarin deh.
Well, whatever.

630
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,930
アーニャ？アーニャ・メルフィッサ？
Anya? Anya Melfissa?

631
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,930
Lagi di dalam kan?
I know you're inside.

632
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:45,930
おい、アーニャ！
Hey, Anya!

633
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,930
大家さん？
The landlady?

634
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,930
Ada apa ya?
What's up, I wonder?

635
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:50,930
はーい？
Yeees?

636
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:51,930
アーニャ...
Anya...

637
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,930
Kamu tahu hari ini tanggal berapa?
Do you know what date today is already?

638
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,430
Bayar kos woi!
Pay your damn rent!

639
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:58,930
Wah, akhir-akhir ini aku sering skip kerja juga.
Ugh, I've been skipping work lately, too.

640
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,930
Em, boleh minta simpati?
Err, can I get some pity here?

641
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:09,311
Jangan- jangan nggak, kayak misalnya, saya bayar bulan depan gitu. Apakah boleh?
Wait, no, like, for example, I can pay next month. Is that okay?

642
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:16,811
Gak boleh dasar freeloader! Sudah berbulan-bulan kau belum bayar ya! Kalau masih gak bisa bayar juga hari ini, maka pergi sekarang juga dari sini!
No way, you freeloader! You haven't paid for months! If you still can't pay today, then get out of here right now!

643
00:35:17,311 --> 00:35:21,411
Aaaaaaaaaaa! Bentar Ibu, bentar!
AAAAAAAAAA! Wait, ma'am, wait!

644
00:35:22,711 --> 00:35:26,311
Ternyata jadi manusia susah juga ya.
Being human is harder than I thought.

645
00:35:26,811 --> 00:35:33,611
Harus kerja dan melakukan beberapa hal lain hanya untuk bisa makan dan tinggal di tempat yang enak.
You have to work and do many other things just to eat and live in a nice place.

646
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:37,711
Mungkin menjadi manusia memang bukan ide yang bagus.
Maybe becoming human wasn't such a good idea after all.

647
00:35:38,211 --> 00:35:40,911
Sangat susah beradaptasi.
It's so hard to adapt.

648
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:44,711
Padahal aku adalah senjata legendaris dari masa lalu.
And yet, I'm a legendary weapon from the past.

649
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:48,311
Kenapa aku harus melakukan semua hal merepotkan ini?
Why do I have to do all these troublesome things?

650
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:51,911
Hah... aku capek hari ini.
*Sigh*... I'm tired today.

651
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:56,211
Tidur di bangku di sini dulu deh.
I'll just sleep on this bench for now.

652
00:35:56,511 --> 00:35:58,411
Good night.

653
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:09,011
Halo. Akhirnya kamu terbangun.
Hello. You're finally awake.

654
00:36:09,411 --> 00:36:13,111
Apa? Ini di mana? Anda siapa?
What? Where is this? Who are you?

655
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:15,611
Kamu pingsan di depan studio kami.
You passed out in front of our studio.

656
00:36:16,011 --> 00:36:18,311
Kenalkan, nama saya Mr. Yagoo.
Nice to meet you. I'm Mr. Yagoo.

657
00:36:18,711 --> 00:36:20,611
Silakan minum minuman hangat ini dulu.
Please, have some of this warm drink.

658
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:25,011
Mr. Yagoo...? Mr. Yagoo...?

659
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:28,511
ちょっと怪しいんだけど…
(Okay, this is VERY suspicious.)

660
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:31,111
Ya sudahlah. Salam kenal juga.
Whatever. Nice to meet you too.

661
00:36:31,511 --> 00:36:36,011
Mungkin tidak terlihat dari penampilan, tapi saya merupakan senjata kuno yang legendaris.
I might not look like it, but I'm actually a legendary ancient weapon.

662
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:40,011
Yah, walaupun baru diusir dari tempat kos saya.
Well, although I was just kicked out of my boarding house.

663
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:45,411
Makanya! Itu dia!
That's why! Exactly!

664
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:48,411
Kenapa sih manusia itu begitu kejam?
Why are humans so cruel?

665
00:36:48,911 --> 00:36:51,311
Mana egois pula... saya sungguh tidak paham!
And so selfish... I really don't understand!

666
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:54,611
Anak muda zaman sekarang tuh begini semua ya?
Is this how all young people are these days?

667
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:56,311
Terdengar berat sekali.
That sounds rough.

668
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:57,911
Benar kan!
Right?!

669
00:36:58,211 --> 00:37:02,011
Saya tidak tahu harus bagaimana sekarang.
I really don't know what to do anymore.

670
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,311
Bagaimana jika anda menjadi talent dari agensi kami?
Well... how about becoming a talent for our agency?

671
00:37:05,711 --> 00:37:06,611
Menjadi seorang idol!
As an idol!

672
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:09,611
Eh? Apa maksudnya?
Eh? What do you mean?

673
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:13,911
Talent... maksudnya jadi idola VTuber?
Talent... you mean like an idol VTuber?

674
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:18,011
Eh? Seperti Tokino Sora, idola VTuber terkenal itu?
Eh? Like Tokino Sora, that famous idol VTuber?

675
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:22,611
Benar. Dia juga bagian dari kami, hololive production.
That's right. She's also part of our hololive production.

676
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:26,111
Sebagai gantinya, kamu bisa tinggal di sini sementara waktu.
In exchange, you can stay here for the time being.

677
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,111
Aku mau! Mau, mau!
Count me in!

678
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,553
この生活の 虜になっちゃうよ Lady
I'll become a prisoner of this life, Lady.

679
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:52,011
光を失った おさがりの宝石を 永久に纏って
Forever wearing second-hand jewels that have lost their light.

680
00:37:53,211 --> 00:37:59,211
トリコロージュ / Lyrics + Composition: 煮ル果実
Tricologe / Lyrics + Composition: Nilfruits

681
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:11,711
救われたの光 救いが虚無になるなんて
The light that saved me became a void,

682
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:15,311
まるでフィクション トラパネーション 浮き足気分になってんだ
Just like fiction, trepanation, I'm feeling restless.

683
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:19,011
足枷と鎖に縛られて たった一度の光で会うため
Bound by shackles and chains, just to meet with that one-time light,

684
00:38:19,011 --> 00:38:22,711
この部屋でずっと待ってる 何かを待つ囚人
Waiting in this room forever, a prisoner waiting for something.

685
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:26,411
出されたものは満遍なく 残さず平らげて
Eating everything that was served without leaving anything behind,

686
00:38:26,411 --> 00:38:30,111
異端な死よりも 誰よりも無個性だった
Being more personality-less than anyone else, even more than a heretical death.

687
00:38:30,111 --> 00:38:33,711
住めば都 暗い歌を何度も何度も吐き捨てて
Any place is home, spitting out dark songs over and over again,

688
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:37,211
挙句の果て ふれる行為自体が苦手になった
In the end, I became bad at the act of touching itself.

689
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:44,211
夜中 ふとに映った 煌めく仮面舞踏会
In the middle of the night, a sparkling masquerade ball suddenly reflected.

690
00:38:44,811 --> 00:38:52,211
馬鹿らしいほどに 狂おしいほどに 年甲斐もなく惹き込まれたら
If I'm drawn in so ridiculously, so maddeningly, regardless of my age.

691
00:38:52,211 --> 00:38:59,211
この生活の 虜になっちゃうよ Lady
I'll become a prisoner of this life, Lady.

692
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:07,211
よく似合ってるってさ お誂え向きだってさ その後のことは見向きもしないくせに
You say it suits me well, you say it's just right, even though you won't even look at what happens after.

693
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:14,211
生活の 虜になっちゃうよ Lady Lady
A prisoner of life, Lady Lady.

694
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:19,211
痛みだってさ 言えぬ傷だってさ すべて生き抜いた証
Even pain, even wounds that can't be spoken of, are all proof of having survived.

695
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:24,211
乗り越える試練 他愛もないことでしょう
A trial to overcome, it's nothing significant, is it?

696
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:42,211
少し欠けてるピンコパール 迷子になったアイオライト
A slightly chipped pink opal, a lost iolite,

697
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:46,211
埃を被るトパーズ 孤独なアメトリンもみんな
A dusty topaz, and lonely ametrine, everyone.

698
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:50,211
それぞれ着飾って 濁って重くなって
Dressing up in their own ways, getting muddy and heavy,

699
00:39:50,211 --> 00:39:54,211
奈落の底 牢獄に 沈んでいくとしても
Even if they sink into the bottom of the abyss, into a prison.

700
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:58,211
訪れた幸せかぼちゃ 祝祭日みたいに
Like the happiness that arrived, like a public holiday,

701
00:39:58,211 --> 00:40:02,211
すでに決められた予定調和
A pre-established harmony that's already been decided.

702
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,825
...思い出させてしまう
...it makes me remember.

703
00:40:03,825 --> 00:40:05,725
貶めても構わないよと
Go ahead and humiliate me.

704
00:40:05,725 --> 00:40:09,625
希望有りの絶望に変えて依存 依存
Turning hopeful despair into addiction, addiction.

705
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:16,225
生活の 虜になっちゃうレイデー
Captivated by this life, Lady.

706
00:40:16,225 --> 00:40:17,625
「いつか報われる」
It'll pay off someday."

707
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,325
「認めてもらえる」
I'll be recognized."

708
00:40:19,325 --> 00:40:22,625
気休めの呪文で踊るのさ
Dancing to a hollow spell.

709
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:24,325
エゴを騙すの
Deceiving the ego.

710
00:40:24,325 --> 00:40:31,825
生活の 終わりはすぐそこレイデー レイデー
The end of this life is right there, Lady, Lady.

711
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:34,925
綻びを目で追うふりをして
Pretending to eye the frayed edges.

712
00:40:34,925 --> 00:40:39,025
生きていくため 乗り越える試練
An ordeal to overcome just to survive.

713
00:40:39,025 --> 00:40:42,525
仕方ないことでしょう
It can't be helped, can it?

714
00:40:55,525 --> 00:41:02,325
この生活の 虜になっちゃうレイデー
Captivated by this life, Lady.

715
00:41:02,325 --> 00:41:06,325
当たり障りのない大衆的な宝石は
Harmless, common jewels...

716
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:11,025
もう必要はない濁りさえも綺麗
...are no longer needed; even the blur is beautiful.

717
00:41:11,025 --> 00:41:17,825
生活の 虜になっちゃえレイデー レイデー
Become a captive of this life, Lady, Lady.

718
00:41:17,825 --> 00:41:21,025
生臭かった金にならないカサ
Fishy, worthless leftovers.

719
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:25,525
琴線を奏でない言葉は無用
Words that don't pull at heartstrings are useless.

720
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:32,325
生活の 虜になっちゃったレイデー レイデー
I've become a captive of this life, Lady, Lady.

721
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:36,225
「痛かった」ってさえ 言えない秘密も
Even the secret of not being able to say "it hurt"...

722
00:41:36,225 --> 00:41:39,925
そう生きていくため まともなものだもの
...is perfectly normal just to keep living.

723
00:41:39,925 --> 00:41:44,525
他愛もないことでしょう
It's nothing special, is it?

724
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:50,525
レイデー レイデー
Lady, Lady.

725
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:56,525
あなたも虜でしょう
You're a captive too, aren't you?

726
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:12,025
うわああああ! ありがとう!
Waaaah! Thank you!

727
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:13,025
おめでとう!
Congratulations!

728
00:42:13,025 --> 00:42:15,525
うるせー! ありがとう!
Shut up! Thank you!

729
00:42:18,325 --> 00:42:20,725
え、え、来てくれてありがとう本当に。
E-e-, thank you so much for coming, really.

730
00:42:20,725 --> 00:42:21,925
当たり前ですよ、来るじゃん。
Of course, I'd obviously come.

731
00:42:21,925 --> 00:42:23,825
もう呼んでくれてありがとうね。
Thank you so much for inviting me.

732
00:42:23,825 --> 00:42:26,825
ねえ、ありがとうね。もう嬉しい。
Right, thank you. I'm so happy.

733
00:42:28,025 --> 00:42:31,925
やっぱ去年ね、なんか仲良くなった。めちゃくちゃ遊んだね、去年。
After all, we got close last year. We hung out a lot.

734
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:35,725
去年、あの嘘でね。
Last year, with that 'lie' game.

735
00:42:35,725 --> 00:42:40,325
というね、あのゲームにね。めちゃめちゃ遊ばせてもらいました。
That game, right. We got to play it so much.

736
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,325
ありがとうございます。いやね、もう、ここに呼んだ理由も、やっぱ...
Thank you. Well, the reason I invited you here is...

737
00:42:47,825 --> 00:42:50,325
声が曲に合うと思ったから。
...because I thought your voice would suit the song.

738
00:42:50,325 --> 00:42:51,525
嬉しい!
I'm so happy!

739
00:42:51,525 --> 00:42:54,025
やったぜ。え、めっちゃ練習しましたよ。
Alright. I practiced so much.

740
00:42:54,025 --> 00:42:56,525
ありがとう。めっちゃいい声でした。
Thank you. Your voice was amazing.

741
00:42:56,525 --> 00:42:59,025
本当? ありがとう。めっちゃいい声でした、もう。
Really? Thanks. It was a really good voice, really.

742
00:42:59,025 --> 00:43:01,025
小さなアーニャ。
Little Anya.

743
00:43:01,025 --> 00:43:04,525
いや、そんな変わらんって。結構変わってる? そんな変わらんって、もう。
Hey, it's not that different. Is it really? Not that different, really.

744
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:12,725
やっぱこのさ、後ろに飛んでるドローン。ずっと気になってて。
That drone flying behind us... I've been curious about it.

745
00:43:12,725 --> 00:43:16,025
やっぱドローン気になるんだ。カメラになってるんだよね、実は。
So you are curious about it. It's actually a camera.

746
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:20,025
すごいよね、これね。こんな飛んでる。
It's amazing, isn't it. It's just flying there.

747
00:43:20,025 --> 00:43:23,025
色々いいアングルも見せられたんじゃないかな。
I think we were able to show some good angles with it.

748
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:28,025
本当に素晴らしい、素敵な感じになったんじゃないでしょうか。
It really created a wonderful, lovely atmosphere.

749
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:32,725
ですね。うん、こちらのアーニャお披露目、まだまだ続いていくと。
Right. Yeah, this Anya showcase is still going on.

750
00:43:33,325 --> 00:43:37,525
いや、本当に、呼んでもらって嬉しかったんで。また一緒に遊ぼう。
No, really, I'm glad you invited me. Let's hang out again.

751
00:43:37,525 --> 00:43:40,725
ありがとう来てくれて。いつでも行くよ。また。
Thanks for coming. I'll come anytime. Later.

752
00:43:41,825 --> 00:43:45,025
また遊ぼうね。ルーナも挟んで、3人でも。
Let's hang out again. With Luna too, the three of us.

753
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:52,325
絆、あるかどうかわかんないんですけど。あるよ、全然ある!
I don't know if we have 'bonds'... We do, definitely!

754
00:43:54,325 --> 00:43:57,825
ねえ、次もルーナ先輩と遊びましょう。遊びましょう、3人で。
Right, let's hang out with Luna-senpai next time. Let's do it.

755
00:43:59,925 --> 00:44:02,325
そねーちゃん、続きも頑張ってね。
Sone-chan, good luck with the rest.

756
00:44:02,325 --> 00:44:05,325
ということで、僕はここでドロンです。ドロンだけに。
So, I'm gonna 'doron' (leave) here. Since it's a drone.

757
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:10,025
やばいだろ。ありがとう。バイバーイ!
That's terrible. Thank you. Bye-bye!

758
00:44:47,525 --> 00:44:49,325
段々言葉を吐いた
Little by little, I spat out words.

759
00:44:49,325 --> 00:44:51,325
あんな想い出に泣いたのは
Crying over those memories...

760
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:54,725
今日で終わりにするのか
...will you end it today?

761
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,325
1, 2の合図を待って
Waiting for the signal: 1, 2.

762
00:44:56,325 --> 00:44:58,325
You & Me 手を取り合ったのは
You & Me, taking each other's hands...

763
00:44:58,325 --> 00:45:02,525
僕の勇気ある行動
...was my courageous act.

764
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:03,839
お気に召すまま
At Your Pleasure

765
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:04,839
なら　エンドロールまで
So, until the end roll

766
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:08,339
そぞろなしいな　この人生
This life is a bit restless

767
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,839
退屈なんて言わないでね
Don't say it's boring, okay?

768
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:14,339
言わないでね
Don't say it, okay?

769
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:22,339
今更なんて言わないでね
Don't say it's too late now, okay?

770
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:30,039
僕ら今　さあさあ輪になって
We're now, come on, in a circle

771
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:32,639
回り始める　段々嫌になって
Beginning to spin, gradually getting sick of it

772
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:34,639
でも気になるね
But I'm still curious, aren't I?

773
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:36,339
目は離せないや
I can't take my eyes off it

774
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:40,339
自分勝手も　ドンドン宙に舞って
Selfishness too, keeps dancing in the air

775
00:45:40,339 --> 00:45:43,839
でも離れてく　パッパ音に乗って
But it drifts away, riding the sound

776
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:46,839
踊り始める　段々嫌になって
Beginning to dance, gradually getting sick of it

777
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:48,339
でも気になるね
But I'm still curious, aren't I?

778
00:45:48,339 --> 00:45:49,839
目は離せないや
I can't take my eyes off it

779
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:54,339
この先ずっと　僕の心をシェイクシェイクイェイ
From now on, forever, shake shake my heart, yeah

780
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:59,639
大正解なんてないのさ　じゃあ一体どこに向かえば
There's no right answer, so where should I head?

781
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:02,639
物語は終わりますか
Will the story end?

782
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:05,839
ワンツーの合図を待って　ユーアンドミー手が触れ合ったのは
Waiting for the one-two signal, you and me, our hands touched

783
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:08,839
僕の勇気ある行動
Because of my courageous action

784
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:10,339
フェイズ
Phase

785
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:14,339
畏まってたって　意味ないんだって
Being stiff is meaningless

786
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:17,839
恥ずかしがってた　夢にバイバイです
Goodbye to the dreams I was shy about

787
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:21,639
この先ずっと　よろしくね
From now on, forever, nice to meet you

788
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:26,039
君といま　さあさあ混ざり合って
With you now, come on, mixing together

789
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:29,339
目を逸らしあう　段々嫌になって
Avoiding each other's eyes, gradually getting sick of it

790
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:30,839
でも気になるね
But I'm still curious, aren't I?

791
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:32,639
目は離せないや
I can't take my eyes off it

792
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,339
自分勝手も　トントン様になって
Selfishness too, starts to look good

793
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:39,639
崩れ落ちてく　パッパ触れる前に
Collapsing, before it can even touch

794
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,839
消えてしまうの　燦々嫌になって
Disappearing, completely getting sick of it

795
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:44,339
でも気になるね
But I'm still curious, aren't I?

796
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:45,839
目は離せないや
I can't take my eyes off it

797
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:49,839
この先ずっと　分かり合えるまで僕たちは
From now on, forever, until we understand each other, we...

798
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:12,339
今更なんて言わないでね
Don't say it's too late now, okay?

799
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:19,839
僕ら今　さあさあ輪になって
We're now, come on, in a circle

800
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:23,039
回り始める　段々嫌になって
Beginning to spin, gradually getting sick of it

801
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:25,039
でも気になるね
But I'm still curious, aren't I?

802
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:26,639
目は離せないや
I can't take my eyes off it

803
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:30,039
自分勝手も　ドンドン宙に舞って
Selfishness too, keeps dancing in the air

804
00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:32,839

But it drifts away, riding the sound

805
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,039
踊り始める　段々嫌になって
Beginning to dance, gradually getting sick of it

806
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:37,339
でも気になるね
But I'm still curious, aren't I?

807
00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:38,839
目は離せないや
I can't take my eyes off it

808
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,339
この先ずっと　僕の心をシェイクシェイクイェイ
From now on, forever, shake shake my heart, yeah

809
00:48:31,339 --> 00:48:35,339
わああ！　イェーイ！
Waaaa! Yay!

810
00:48:36,339 --> 00:48:38,339
アーニャちゃん、3Dおめでとう！

そうだね。ロックだったね。
Right. It was rock.

817
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,839
ね、ロック。めちゃくちゃ、もう、体がね、止まらないの。
Yeah, rock. My body just... wouldn't stop.

818
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:58,339
ああ、これ、これずっとやってるもん。
Ah, I've been doing this the whole time.

819
00:48:58,339 --> 00:49:01,339
アーニャが……アーニャの手が止まらねぇ！
Anya's... Anya's hand won't stop!

820
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:05,339
やめろ！　あああ！
Stop it! Aaaa!

821
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:09,339
やめろ！　俺のパンチやめて！
Stop it! Stop my punches!

822
00:49:10,339 --> 00:49:12,339
ということでね、なんでこの曲選んだの？
So, why did you choose this song?

823
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:17,339
え、だって、わためちゃんにかっこいい曲、似合うからね。
Well, because cool songs suit you, Watame-chan.

824
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,839
嬉しい。え、大丈夫だった？　こんなやりたい放題させてもらって。
I'm happy. Uh, was it okay? Letting me run wild like this.

825
00:49:21,339 --> 00:49:23,839
いやいやいや、これしかないやろ。
No no no, it had to be this.

826
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,339
これしかないよな、もう。
It had to be this, really.

827
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:27,339
これしかないよな。
It had to be this.

828
00:49:28,339 --> 00:49:30,839
まあ、ロックしていこうぜ、この後も。
Well, let's keep rocking after this too.

829
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:32,839
ロックしていこうぜ！
Let's keep rocking!

830
00:49:33,339 --> 00:49:36,339

You know, we also noticed that...

832
00:49:39,339 --> 00:49:41,339
お、気づいたことがありました？
Oh, you noticed something?

833
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:43,339
なんと。顔が似てるんだよな！
Actually, our faces look similar!

834
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:45,839
お、似てる？　でかいということか？
Oh, similar? You mean they're big?

835
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:48,839
似てるよね、ほら見て。
They're similar, right? Look.

ほらほら、似てるよね。
Look, look, they're similar, right?

837
00:49:51,339 --> 00:49:54,339
いや似てるって。瞳の色もね、同じだし。紫だしね。
I'm telling you, they're similar. Our eye color is the same too, both purple.

838
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,339
ね、顔でかいし。
And we have big faces.

839
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:02,339

Coba-coba suruh tebak, tebak, tebak.

00:51:51,154 --> 00:51:53,654
Ada TV! Ada TV!
There's a TV! There's a TV!

872
00:52:43,154 --> 00:52:46,154
Kureiji Ollie, bagaimana tadi? Kita... joget dan nyanyi...
Kureiji Ollie, how was that? We... danced and sang...

873
00:52:46,154 --> 00:52:49,154
enggak nyanyi sih, joget tapi ke Identity Voices.
well not sang, but danced to Identity Voices.

874
00:52:50,654 --> 00:52:52,154
How was that?

875
00:52:52,654 --> 00:52:54,654
Gue baru tahu lu bisa nge-DJ!
I just found out you could DJ!

876
00:52:54,654 --> 00:52:57,154
Iya, that's one of my hidden skills.
Yeah, that's one of my hidden skills.

877
00:52:57,154 --> 00:52:59,654
Well, I've been living for like hundreds of years.

878
00:52:59,654 --> 00:53:01,654
Oh benar juga, sudah lama.
Oh right, it's been a long time.

879
00:53:01,654 --> 00:53:05,154
Makanya I have a lot of hidden skills. Dan Pavolia Reine, bagaimana tadi?
That's why I have a lot of hidden skills. And Pavolia Reine, how was that?

880
00:53:05,154 --> 00:53:07,654
Tadi... kita ngapain aja ya? Saking hype-nya...
Just now... what were we doing? We were so hyped...

881
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:12,654
Saking hype-nya lupa kita ngapain aja.
So hyped I forgot what we did.

882
00:53:12,654 --> 00:53:16,654
Kita nge-DJ dan joget... bergerak sendiri.
We were DJing and dancing... moving on our own.

883
00:53:16,654 --> 00:53:19,154
Iya, bergerak. Bergerak. Aduh gila, seru banget gila.
Yeah, moving. Moving. Man, it was crazy fun.

884
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:22,654
Ya sudah berarti... ini aja enggak sih? Eh, by the way, itu udah berkilau!
Alright then... should we just do this? Eh, by the way, it's already shiny!

885
00:53:31,154 --> 00:53:34,154
Ha? Enggak lah, tunggu, belum kita masih ada lagi!
Huh? No way, wait, we're not done yet!

886
00:53:34,154 --> 00:53:36,654
Masih ada? Iya.
There's more? Yes.

887
00:53:37,654 --> 00:53:40,654
Wah, apa tuh? Kita mau ngapain, Guys?
Whoa, what is it? What are we gonna do, guys?

888
00:53:40,654 --> 00:53:43,154
Ngapain sih kira-kira?
What do you think?

889
00:53:42,654 --> 00:53:46,154
Kita bakal... kita bakal itu enggak sih? Ini udah di stage bertiga.
We're gonna... we're gonna do that, right? We're already on stage together.

890
00:53:46,154 --> 00:53:50,154
Kita mau nyanyi dan joget bareng!
We're gonna sing and dance together!

891
00:53:50,654 --> 00:53:54,154
Yes! Kita atur-atur formasi dulu nanti.
Yes! Let's get into formation.

892
00:53:54,154 --> 00:53:56,654
Oke, siap formasi nanti. Oke.
Okay, get ready for formation. Okay.

893
00:53:56,154 --> 00:53:58,654
Oke, dengarkan, listen to our song...
Okay, listen, listen to our song...

894
00:53:58,654 --> 00:54:01,654
our cover song I guess.

895
00:54:04,154 --> 00:54:08,154
Oke! Gekkou!
Okay! Moonlight!

896
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:21,154
ガラクタだとかゴミを詰めて
Filled with junk and trash

897
00:54:21,154 --> 00:54:24,154
ボロ布ひとつを被せた
I covered it with a rag

898
00:54:24,154 --> 00:54:26,154
目に食い込んだ影をした
I had shadows digging into my eyes

899
00:54:26,154 --> 00:54:27,154
偽物
Fake

900
00:54:27,154 --> 00:54:30,654
誰かが紡いだ言葉を
Words someone else spun

901
00:54:30,654 --> 00:54:34,154
誰かが奏でた色を
Colors someone else played

902
00:54:34,154 --> 00:54:35,654
歪にコラージュした
I collaged them distortedly

903
00:54:35,654 --> 00:54:36,154
偽物
Fake

904
00:54:36,154 --> 00:54:39,654
一番最初の青の中
In the very first blue

905
00:54:39,654 --> 00:54:43,154
革新的な少年の愛情が
A revolutionary boy's love

906
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,654
ほら
Look

907
00:54:44,654 --> 00:54:47,654
僕ら気づいたらもう見えなくなる
By the time we noticed, we could no longer see

908
00:54:47,654 --> 00:54:51,154
おもちゃ失くした子供も泣いている
Even the child who lost their toy is crying

909
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:54,654
どうしたら終わるのスポットライトに
When will it end? Under the spotlight

910
00:54:54,654 --> 00:54:57,154
照らされている
Being illuminated

911
00:54:57,154 --> 00:54:58,654
その背中は
That back

912
00:54:58,654 --> 00:55:01,154
まだこの手から遠ざかっていく
Is still drifting further from this hand

913
00:55:01,154 --> 00:55:03,154
あなたみたいになれやしなくて
I can never become like you

914
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:04,769
あなたみたいになれやしなくて
I can't become like you

915
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:05,769
あの月を追いかけるように
Like chasing that moon

916
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:06,869
渇いた心は
My parched heart

917
00:55:06,869 --> 00:55:09,469
満たされないまま
Remains unfulfilled

918
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:12,169
ひとりになって、ひとりになって
All alone, all alone

919
00:55:12,169 --> 00:55:15,169
くすんだ夢を見続けてしまった
I kept on seeing a faded dream

920
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:18,069
ガラクタだって、ボロギレだって
Even if it's junk, even if it's rags

921
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:20,769
その心臓が脈打つ限りには
As long as that heart beats

922
00:55:20,769 --> 00:55:25,469
僕だけの怒りがあった
There was an anger only I could feel

923
00:55:34,469 --> 00:55:37,469
足りないのは何だったんだろう
What was it that was missing?

924
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:39,569
神様に聞いてきたあとで
After I went to ask God

925
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:43,269
堕天使の弓矢に口止めされた
A fallen angel's arrow silenced me

926
00:55:43,269 --> 00:55:45,769
初めから知っていたんだよ
I knew it from the start

927
00:55:45,769 --> 00:55:48,169
忘れた芝居をしてんだよ
I'm just pretending I forgot

928
00:55:48,169 --> 00:55:51,469
もらいもんの剣を抱きしめている
Clutching onto a borrowed sword

929
00:55:52,269 --> 00:55:54,569
何十回目の失望だろう
How many times have I been disappointed now?

930
00:55:54,569 --> 00:55:57,069
いっそ何もかも捨ててしまいたいと
I'd rather just throw everything away

931
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:03,469
結局最後は何にも残らない
In the end, nothing remains

932
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:07,469
愛も紡いでも名前も朽ちていく
Love and the names we weave also decay

933
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:09,969
どうしてだろう
I wonder why

934
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:13,469
この胸の奥にこびりついている
It's stuck deep within my chest

935
00:56:13,469 --> 00:56:17,769
冬の夜の静寂に似た孤独を
A loneliness like the silence of a winter night

936
00:56:17,769 --> 00:56:20,769
あなたはきっと知りもしないで
You surely won't even know

937
00:56:20,769 --> 00:56:22,769
ひとりに星を見ていた
As you watched the stars alone

938
00:56:22,769 --> 00:56:26,469
赤い目の僕に気も留めないまま
Without even noticing my red eyes

939
00:56:27,069 --> 00:56:29,769
隣に立ってたあなた遠くで
You were standing right beside me, yet so far

940
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:33,069
くすんだ夢も見えなくなってしまって
Even the faded dream became invisible

941
00:56:33,069 --> 00:56:35,469
それでも追い続けて
But I'll keep on chasing it anyway

942
00:56:35,969 --> 00:56:38,169
偽物だって本当だって
Whether it's fake or real

943
00:56:38,169 --> 00:56:43,469
振り返れば最後そこには
ぼやけた記憶があった
If I look back, in the end,
there's only a blurred memory

944
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:46,469
骸を貸したいのに
I want to lend my remains

945
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:48,769
クリシェを抜け出したいのに
I want to escape the cliché

946
00:56:48,769 --> 00:56:51,769
また誰かの焼き直し？
Is this another rehash of someone else?

947
00:56:51,769 --> 00:56:54,769
数多の星の屑たち
Multitudes of stardust

948
00:56:54,769 --> 00:56:57,769
沈みゆくユーティリティ
A sinking utility

949
00:56:57,769 --> 00:57:01,069
無慈悲な月の光
The merciless moonlight

950
00:57:01,069 --> 00:57:03,769
アイデンティティさえまやかし？
Is even identity just a deception?

951
00:57:10,069 --> 00:57:12,769
盗んででも愛が欲しい？
Do you want love even if you have to steal it?

952
00:57:17,769 --> 00:57:21,769
何時の世も同じことばかり繰り返す
Repeating the same thing in every era

953
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:25,769
懐かしい歌が風に揺れている
A nostalgic song sways in the wind

954
00:57:25,769 --> 00:57:29,469
あなたの声で教えてもらった言葉
The words I was taught by your voice

955
00:57:29,469 --> 00:57:32,069
今でも忘れぬように
So that I won't forget them even now

956
00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:34,769
書き留めている同じことを
I'm writing down the same things

957
00:57:35,469 --> 00:57:36,769
あなたみたいになれやしなくて
I can't become like you

958
00:57:36,769 --> 00:57:38,769
あの月を追いかけるように
Like chasing that moon

959
00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:42,069
渇いた心は満たされないまま
My parched heart remains unfulfilled

960
00:57:43,769 --> 00:57:46,769
時間が経って時間が経って
As time passes, as time passes

961
00:57:46,769 --> 00:57:50,069
振り返る時目をそらさぬように
So I won't look away when looking back

962
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:52,169
なぞる僕たちは
We who trace our path

963
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,769
偽物だってボロギレだって
Whether we're fakes or rags

964
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:57,469
覚めた夢を抱いた先には
At the end of clutching a dream I woke from

965
00:57:57,469 --> 00:58:03,469
僕だけの光がずっと
My own light will always remain

966
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:19,669
あ、OK guys, gimana tadi?
Ah, OK guys, how was that?

967
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:21,869
Emm, kita Holoro nyanyi bareng ya,
Umm, we Holoro sang together,

968
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:23,569
dan nge-DJ bareng.
and DJ'd together.

969
00:58:23,669 --> 00:58:25,869
Oh my god, oh my god, capek. Capek.
Oh my god, oh my god, I'm tired. So tired.

970
00:58:28,169 --> 00:58:29,769
OK, we sang Gekkou,

971
00:58:29,869 --> 00:58:32,569
me, Ollie, and Reine sang Gekkou.

972
00:58:32,669 --> 00:58:33,669
How was it?

973
00:58:33,769 --> 00:58:36,669
It's one of my favorite songs and I'm so
happy I got to sing it with them!

974
00:58:38,469 --> 00:58:40,969
And oh my god, ま、色々ありましたね。
And oh my god, well, lots of things happened.

975
00:58:41,069 --> 00:58:43,169
かなた先輩とね、あの一緒にドロンしたし、
I 'disappeared' together with Kanata-senpai,

976
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,969
ま、私はドロンしてなかったんですけど。
well, I didn't actually disappear myself though.

977
00:58:46,469 --> 00:58:48,769
で、わためちゃんともね、あのベースもね、
And with Watame-chan, the bass part too,

978
00:58:48,869 --> 00:58:50,869
こう何にもね、あの弾きましたね。
we played it like this.

979
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:53,169
いやぁ、楽しかった！
Man, that was fun!

980
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:55,969
で、ID 2期生と一緒にDJ、そして「月光」歌いましたと。
And then the DJ session and singing
'Gekkou' with ID Gen 2.

981
00:58:57,069 --> 00:58:59,969
いかがでしたでしょうか？ How was it everyone?
How was it? How was it everyone?

982
00:59:02,069 --> 00:59:04,769
ま、このあともね、色々まだあるので。
Well, there's still more to come after this.

983
00:59:04,869 --> 00:59:07,969
After this there's still some stuff
that I want to show you guys.

984
00:59:08,969 --> 00:59:10,969
Oh my goodness.

985
00:59:11,169 --> 00:59:12,769
あれ？あれ？
Huh? What?

986
00:59:12,869 --> 00:59:13,969
ん？
Hmm?

987
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:15,169
What's that?

988
00:59:15,269 --> 00:59:16,569
Wait what? What's that sound?

989
00:59:16,669 --> 00:59:18,069
Hello? Wait what? What is that?

990
00:59:19,869 --> 00:59:21,869
Something is flying. Wait what?

991
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:25,469
Ha, kaya terlihat familiar guys.
Ha, that looks familiar guys.

992
00:59:26,669 --> 00:59:29,669
あれ？あれ知ってる顔だぞ。え？
Huh? I know that face. What?

993
00:59:29,769 --> 00:59:31,569
ちょっと、ちょっと見てみたい。
Wait, I want to take a look.

994
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:34,669
あれちょっと近く、近くから見てみたい。あれ？
I want to see it from a bit closer. Huh?

995
00:59:36,569 --> 00:59:38,569
Is that, wait, is that YAGOO?

996
00:59:38,669 --> 00:59:40,769
Is that YAGOO? あれ？
Is that YAGOO? Huh?

997
00:59:41,669 --> 00:59:43,869
Ha, YAGOO ke sini guys.
Ha, YAGOO's coming here guys.

998
00:59:43,969 --> 00:59:47,669
YAGOO-nya, YAGOO-nya bisa melayang dong kocak.
YAGOO, YAGOO can fly! That's hilarious.

999
00:59:47,769 --> 00:59:49,469
YAGOO beneran woi.
It's really YAGOO.

1000
00:59:49,569 --> 00:59:51,769
Hai, YAGOO, YAGOO-nya bisa melayang.
Hi, YAGOO, YAGOO can fly.

1001
00:59:51,869 --> 00:59:53,169
YAGOO！
YAGOO!

1002
00:59:53,269 --> 00:59:55,769
YAGOOさん、こっちこっち！
YAGOO-san, over here, over here!

1003
01:00:06,883 --> 01:00:08,883
あれ？一体何が？
Huh? What on earth?

1004
01:00:08,983 --> 01:00:10,083
あれ？
Wait...

1005
01:00:10,183 --> 01:00:11,883
YAGOOさんですよね？
You're Yagoo-san, right?

1006
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,683
飛べるんですか？
Can you fly?

1007
01:00:14,683 --> 01:00:15,883
そうですね。
That's right.

1008
01:00:15,983 --> 01:00:18,883
アーニャさん、3Dお披露目おめでとうございます。
Anya-san, congratulations on your 3D debut.

1009
01:00:18,983 --> 01:00:20,683
ええ、もしかして...
Wait, could it be...

1010
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,383
...今日わざわざここまで？
...you came all the way here today?

1011
01:00:22,483 --> 01:00:24,083
ありがとうございます！
Thank you very much!

1012
01:00:24,183 --> 01:00:26,283
せっかくなので、
Since we have this opportunity,

1013
01:00:26,383 --> 01:00:29,683
まあ我々ホロライブID2期生はね、
well, we, Hololive ID Gen 2,

1014
01:00:29,783 --> 01:00:32,283
3Dお披露目をしたわけなんですけれども、
have just had our 3D debuts,

1015
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,683
YAGOOさんのご感想を聞きたいんですが、
but I'd like to hear Yagoo-san's thoughts,

1016
01:00:34,783 --> 01:00:36,483
いただいてもよろしいですか？
if that's alright?

1017
01:00:36,483 --> 01:00:39,583
ホロライブインドネシアの皆さんも、
Everyone in Hololive Indonesia,

1018
01:00:39,683 --> 01:00:41,383
1期生に続いて2期生の皆さんも
after Gen 1, now Gen 2 as well,

1019
01:00:41,483 --> 01:00:43,683
3Dお披露目できて、とても良かったと思います。

どっからどう見ても品行方正
However you look at me, I'm well-behaved

1060

いたって真面目でいいじゃんね
I'm perfectly serious, and that's fine, right?

1061
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:19,183
眼鏡かけ歩く天真爛漫
Innocently walking around with my glasses on

1062
01:03:19,183 --> 01:03:21,583
本当の自分がわからない
I don't know who my true self is

1063
01:03:21,883 --> 01:03:24,283
マスクを付けて隠してる
Wearing a mask to hide away

1064
01:03:24,283 --> 01:03:26,683
泣きそうな顔全部隠してる
Hiding every part of my tearful face

1065
01:03:26,683 --> 01:03:29,183
夜がくるたびに思い出してる
Recalling it every time night falls

1066

空駆けシュレッダー隠してく
Hiding the shredder that races across the sky

1067

もう　うんざりかい？
Are you fed up already?

1068
01:03:36,883 --> 01:03:39,383
アンリアルなままで絶好調で
In top form while remaining unreal

1069
01:03:39,383 --> 01:03:41,883
隠してた本当の自分も
Even the true self I kept hidden

1070
01:03:41,883 --> 01:03:44,383
有耶無耶にならないで
Don't let it become vague

1071
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:46,883
甘い嘘も本当にしよう
Let's turn even sweet lies into truth

1072
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:49,983
可愛く笑って
Smile cutely

1073

コードの上を伝っていくんだ
Transmitting over the cords

1077
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:12,483
ひとつの迷いも揺らさずに
Without letting a single doubt waver

1078
01:04:12,483 --> 01:04:14,983
夜が来たならば公明正大
When night comes, it's fair and square

1079
01:04:14,983 --> 01:04:17,583
嫌いなものは捨てちまえ
Throw away everything you hate

1080
01:04:17,583 --> 01:04:18,783
オッケー
Okay

1081
01:04:18,783 --> 01:04:20,083

気にする奴は知らんね
I don't care about those who mind

1083
01:04:21,383 --> 01:04:22,583
へなちょこなのなんて気にすんな
Don't worry about being a weakling

一瞬で離せよ走り出した世界に
Let go in an instant to the world that's started running

自分で決める神様
The god who decides for themselves

1086
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:31,283
案外弱いみたいな心象
An unexpectedly weak impression

1087
01:04:31,283 --> 01:04:33,783
全部さらけ出してしまいな
Just lay it all bare

1088
01:04:33,783 --> 01:04:36,383
散々悩んだって
No matter how much you worry

1089
01:04:36,383 --> 01:04:38,983
独りきりじゃ歩けないよ
You can't walk all alone

1090
01:04:43,783 --> 01:04:45,383
Say Ho!

1091
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:47,783
Say Ho!

1092
01:04:48,783 --> 01:04:51,283
悪いことしたら神様が見てる
If you do something bad, God is watching

1093
01:04:51,283 --> 01:04:53,783
なんて嘘なんじゃないなんて聞かない
I won't ask if that's a lie

1094
01:04:53,783 --> 01:04:56,283
神すら見せないFAKE FAKE
A FAKE FAKE that not even God can see

1095
01:04:56,283 --> 01:04:58,883
信じてないだなんて誰も言ってない
No one said they don't believe

1096
01:05:01,883 --> 01:05:05,283
散々揺れるマスクをとって
Taking off the heavily swaying mask...

1097
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:06,599
綺麗な自分を晒すんだ
Exposing my beautiful self

1098
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:09,199
全然生きてるじゃんね
I'm totally alive, right?

1099
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:11,599
怖い？辛い？鼻をくくろう
Afraid? Hurting? Let's turn our noses up

1100
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:14,099
今日からまた叫んじょうぜ
From today, let's scream again

1101
01:05:14,099 --> 01:05:16,799
隠してた本当の自分を
The true self you've been hiding

1102
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,399
ある観客になんないで
Don't just be an observer

1103
01:05:19,399 --> 01:05:21,999
甘い？歌も本当にしよう
Naive? Let's make even the song real

1104
01:05:22,099 --> 01:05:24,599
可愛く笑って
Smile cutely

1105
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:27,099
楽しく舞って
Dance joyfully

1106
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:31,799
君が笑っているリアルな今日
A real today where you are smiling

1107
01:05:33,399 --> 01:05:36,799
戦うんだ嘘も吐いて
I'll fight, even telling lies

1108
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:42,299
それもいつかは本当さ 絵も伝う
Even that will be the truth someday, words also flow
