297
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:55,232
呆気ないだろう？
Isn't it underwhelming?

298
00:20:55,232 --> 00:20:57,032
エンジン全開 絶好調
Engine at full throttle, in peak condition

299
00:20:57,032 --> 00:20:59,532
スカしたママ またにもデザート
Acting cool, once more, a dessert

00:21:00,032 --> 00:21:01,532
恐れはしない
I won't be afraid

301
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:02,832
救えもしない
I can't even save it

302
00:21:02,832 --> 00:21:04,232
不完全燃焼
Incomplete combustion

303
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:07,532
花火になってまた飛ばそうぜ チャレンジャー
Become a firework and fly again, Challenger

304
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:11,232
暗い空も 涙も 吹き飛ばすように
To blow away the dark sky and tears

305
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:12,832
払えよ
Sweep it away

306
00:21:12,832 --> 00:21:14,032
痛いよ
It hurts

307
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:16,832
鳴らして醒めてね
Make a sound and wake up

308
00:21:17,032 --> 00:21:21,032
顔上げて ショウはここから
Look up, the show starts from here

決まれ決まれ 一等賞
Win, win the first prize

313
00:21:37,032 --> 00:21:38,832
噛ませ ハッタリもちょっと
Give it a go, a little bluffing

314
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:40,232
真骨頂
My true worth

315
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,832
見切り発車
A snap judgment

316
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:43,032
バーナブル・ショウ
A burnable show

317
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:44,232
表も焼き切り
Burning the surface

318
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:45,532

Even if I get scolded

319
00:21:45,532 --> 00:21:47,032

00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:09,532
詰め込んだ風船
A balloon filled with them

323
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:14,032
銀河を駆けてゆく 旅人たちを乗せて
Across the galaxy, carrying the travelers

324
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,832
まだ終わらない
It's not over yet

325
00:22:15,832 --> 00:22:17,032
終わりたくない
I don't want it to end

326
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:18,832
それでもいつかは
But even so, someday...

327
00:22:18,832 --> 00:22:21,532
その日が来るまで
...until that day comes

328
00:22:22,032 --> 00:22:25,032
いざ躍り明かせ 歌い明かせ
Now, dance all night, sing all night

I won't forget

333
00:22:32,032 --> 00:22:33,232
嘆きはしない
I won't grieve

334
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:35,032
サヨナラじゃないから
Because it's not goodbye

335
00:22:35,232 --> 00:22:39,032

An adventurous and delightful legend

336
00:22:39,032 --> 00:22:40,532

Writing it down

340
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,532
Mr. Showtime!

341
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,232

みんな来てくれたの？ありがとう！
Did everyone come for me? Thank you!

345
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:11,532
いえいえー
No problem.

346
00:23:11,832 --> 00:23:13,232
あーにゃーちゃん！
Anya-chan!

ありがとなんだけどさ…
I'm grateful, but...

350
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:26,532
ありがとなんだけどさ、どういうテンションなの、これ？
I'm grateful, but what's with this energy?

351
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,532
フレア何やってんのさ、こういうテンションだっけ？
Flare, what are you doing? Was the energy like this?

352
00:23:29,832 --> 00:23:31,232
そうだよ、お祝いテンション
That's right, it's celebration energy.

353
00:23:31,232 --> 00:23:33,232
あ、そうなの？逆にどんなんだと思ってたの？
Oh, really? What did you think it was?

354
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:34,532
お祝いテンションなんなの？
What is celebration energy?

355
00:23:34,532 --> 00:23:35,832
そうだよ、そうなの。
Exactly, that's it.

356
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:37,532
そうなんだ。
I see.

357
00:23:38,032 --> 00:23:39,032
アーニャちゃんは…
Anya-chan...

358
00:23:39,032 --> 00:23:39,832
うん。
Yeah.

359
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:41,532
何歳になったの？
How old have you turned?

360
00:23:42,532 --> 00:23:45,032
私は、2才になったの！
I turned 2 years old!

361
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:49,032
みたい。
Apparently.

362
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:50,532
みたいなの。
Something like that.

363
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:51,532
そうだよ。
Indeed.

364
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:54,532
アイリスは、何歳なの？
IRyS, how old are you?

365
00:23:56,232 --> 00:23:57,832
え、アイリスは…
Eh, IRyS is...

366
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:05,532
ちょっとまだ言ってないでしょ！
Wait, I haven't said it yet!

367
00:24:05,532 --> 00:24:07,032
まだ、まだ言ってないから！
I haven't said it yet!

368
00:24:07,032 --> 00:24:08,532
聞いてないから！
I'm not listening!

369
00:24:08,832 --> 00:24:11,032
何歳、アイリスは何歳なの？
How old, how old is IRyS?

370
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:13,832
アイリスは…

00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:20,032
あ、おめでとう！
Ah, congrats!

Thank you, and thank you IRyS too.

376
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,532
アイリスもありがとな、おめでとう。
IRyS too, thank you. Congrats.

377
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:30,032
頑張った頑張った。
Good job, good job.

378
00:24:30,232 --> 00:24:31,532
もうやめて、もう…
Stop it already...

379
00:24:32,032 --> 00:24:33,532
あー、どういうテンション…
Ah, what is this energy...

380
00:24:34,032 --> 00:24:35,232
私はもう消えます。
I'm going to disappear now.

381
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:38,032
アーニャ！逃がさないよ！
Anya! I won't let you escape!

382
00:24:40,032 --> 00:24:43,032
うわぁ〜！恥ずかしいんだけど！
Uwah~! This is so embarrassing!

383
00:24:45,032 --> 00:24:46,032
なぁ、ということでね。
Well, so.

384
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:49,032
ね、Mr. Showtime、4人で歌ったんですけれども。
We just sang 'Mr. Showtime' with the four of us.

385
00:24:49,532 --> 00:24:54,032
いかがでしたでしょうか、感想とか、曲の感想とか。
How was it? Any thoughts on the performance or the song?

386
00:24:54,832 --> 00:24:58,532
もう、めっちゃ難しかったんだわ！
It was seriously so difficult!

387
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,340
高いところと低いところでボボボボボボって
With the high parts and low parts going bo-bo-bo-bo...

388
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,540
ああ、確かにね
Ah, that's true.

389
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,040
低いところばっかだったよ私
I was doing nothing but the low parts.

390
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,540
ありましたね。でもすごかった、かっこよかったですよ。ゴロゴロ〜とかも
You were. But it was amazing, you sounded so cool. Even the growling parts.

391
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,540
本当？イケボアイリス出したことないよって
Really? I've never really done 'cool-voice IRyS' before.

392
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,240
イケボアイリス珍しいからさ、たまにはいいんじゃないかな
Cool-voice IRyS is rare, so I think it's good once in a while.

393
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,540
ま、確かにね。こういうイケボアイリス、レアなんでね
Well, true. This kind of cool-voice IRyS is a rarity.

394
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,040
8歳だもんね
Since you're 8 years old.

395
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,540
8歳なのにね
Even though I'm 8.

396
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,540
もう、もうね、それはそれとして。みんな受け取ってね
Geez, anyway, that aside. Everyone, please take it in...

397
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,540
アイリスのかっこよさを
...IRyS's coolness.

398
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,540
8歳... 8歳... ごめんなさい
8 years old... 8 years old... I'm sorry.

399
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,540
絶対この後アーカイブ見返して
You absolutely have to watch the archive again after this.

400
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,040
やだやだ、見たくない
No, no, I don't want to see it!

401
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,540
見返してほしい。回すたびに今度は見よ
I want you to rewatch it. Watch it every time it loops.

402
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:51,540
でもアーニャのライブはちゃんと見てね。この部分だけ飛ばして
But make sure you watch Anya's live properly. Just skip this part.

403
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,040
一番大事なとこでしょ
That's the most important part!

404
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,240
めっちゃ喉乾いてんな
Man, my throat is so dry.

405
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,040
あら？喉乾いてきた？
Oh? Are you getting thirsty?

406
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,540
急に喉乾いてきたわ。このテンションで喉乾いたわ
Suddenly my throat is parched. This excitement made me thirsty.

407
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,540
なら乾いた。あ、アーニャお腹空いた... あ、お飲み物ないかな？
Then I'm dry. Ah, Anya is hungry... Ah, is there anything to drink?

408
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,540
あ、なんか来た、なんか来た
Oh, something's coming, something's coming.

409
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,540
アーニャちゃん！たくさん歌って喉乾いたでしょ？
Anya-chan! You've been singing a lot, so you must be thirsty, right?

410
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,040
そうだよ
That's right.

411
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,540
これ飲んでほしいのら
I want you to drink this, nanora.

412
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,540
何その声？
What's with that voice?

413
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,540
こぼしてる、こぼしてる。なんか熱そうなの出てきた
She's spilling it, she's spilling it. Something hot-looking came out.

414
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,540
はい、これは
Here, this is...

415
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,540
何これ？怪しいな。熱っ！これ何？
What is this? Suspicious. Hot! What is this?

416
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,040
ねえ、湯気立ってる。熱っ、熱っ
Hey, it's steaming. Hot, hot!

417
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
熱そうだよ、本当
It really looks hot.

418
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,540
うんとこどっこいしょ熱いもの。飲んで、飲んで
Heave-ho, something really hot. Drink it, drink it.

419
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,540
まあ一旦飲むか。飲んで飲んで
Well, I guess I'll try it. Drink up, drink up.

420
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,040
本当に飲んだ！本当に飲んだ！
She actually drank it! She actually drank it!

421
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,540
美味しい？美味しい？
Is it good? Is it good?

422
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,540
ふぅ... めっちゃ、めっちゃ美味しかったよ。でも
Phew... It was really, really delicious. But...

423
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,540
本当？怪しかったけどさ、めっちゃ美味しかった？
Really? It was suspicious, but it was really delicious?

424
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,040
よかった... 美味しかったならよかった
Good... I'm glad if it was tasty.

425
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,040
うわー！え、何、何？
Whoa! Eh, what, what?!

426
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,040
え、どういうこと？デカくなった？
Wait, what's happening? Did I get big?!

427
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,040
アーニャ！どういうこと？
Anya! What's going on?!

428
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,040
デカっ！あんまり動き回らないでよ
She's huge! Don't move around too much!

429
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,540
デカくなっちゃった！ねえ、すごい揺れるね。これ潰れるかな？
I've become huge! Hey, it's shaking like crazy. Is this gonna collapse?

430
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,540
みんな潰れるじゃん。ガミガミやめてよ
We're all gonna get crushed! Stop nagging me!

431
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,540
あ！アイリス！
Ah! IRyS!

432
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,540
ああー！！
AAAAAAHH!!

433
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,540
残りはルーナ先輩、元に戻してくださいよ。じゃないと、潰しちゃうぞ
Luna-senpai, turn me back to normal. Or else I'll crush you!

434
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,540
潰しちゃうぞー
I'll crush you~!

435
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:32,040
ねえ、もしかしてお茶かければ元に戻るの？
Hey, maybe if I pour tea on myself, I'll turn back?

436
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,540
暴力、暴力はやめて！
Violence! Stop the violence!

437
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,040
それだ、やってよルーナ！
That's it! Do it, Luna!

438
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:44,540
やっちゃうよ。頼む、もう一回かけてみる。足元に。普通にかけるのら
I'll do it! Please, I'll try pouring it one more time. On her feet. Just regular pouring, nanora.

439
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,540
戻れるかな？あ、戻った！え？
Can she return? Oh, she's back! Eh?

440
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,540
さっきはよくもやってくれたな
You really put me through it earlier.

441
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,540
ルーナ先輩、ルーナ先輩、どういう飲み物なんですかそれ？
Luna-senpai, Luna-senpai, what kind of drink is that exactly?

442
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,540
小さくなったならね
Well, now she's gotten tiny.

443
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:00,540
そんなことはどうだっていいんだよ。なんなん、さっきはよくも踏みつけてやってくれたね
Never mind that! What the heck, you had the nerve to trample on me earlier!

444
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:05,540
アーニャ、アーニャちゃん、ちっちゃくて可愛いね。餌あげたいよ。餌あげたくなっちゃった
Anya, Anya-chan, you're so small and cute! I want to feed you. I feel like giving you a treat.

445
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:11,540
酷いことしないで。可愛いから、ご褒美あげちゃう
Don't do anything mean! Since you're so cute, I'll give you a reward.

446
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,540
え、どういうご褒美？
Eh? What kind of reward?

447
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:20,540
アーニャちゃん、おっと、それは... それは... アイリスの足が！
Anya-chan, oops, that's... that's... IRyS's leg!

448
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,040
パンチラと見せかけてパンチ！
A punch disguised as a panty shot!

449
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,540
待って、なんて残酷な。痛い、痛い。ちょっと2歳児にやることじゃないよ
Wait, how cruel! Ouch, ouch! Hey, that's not something you do to a 2-year-old!

450
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,540
2歳児だと思います？2歳児、2歳児だよ、こんなにちっちゃくて。可愛いね
You think she's a 2-year-old? A 2-year-old, she really is a 2-year-old, being this tiny. So cute.

451
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:38,540
アーニャにさ、プレゼントもあげたことだし、そろそろ帰ろっか
Well, we've given Anya her present, so it's about time we headed home.

452
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,540
帰るのね。時間だし、じゃあね
Heading home then. It's time, so see ya!

453
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:51,540
待って、その前に元に戻してくださいよ。ちょっと待って、ちょっと待って！
Wait, turn me back before you go! Wait a second! Wait a second!!

454
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,340
Here we go, thank you! The party's over.

455
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,240
お芝居はおしまい
The play is over.

456
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,540
止まらない weekend, weekend
Unstoppable weekend, weekend.

457
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,840
Always be in the show, the show time

458
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,540
Wow! Get up, get ready!

459
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,840
新しい今も back up してくれないように
So that even the new 'now' won't hold us back.

460
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,840
ぐるぐる回る 必ず追いついて見せるから
Spinning round and round, I'll definitely show you I can catch up.

461
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,540
遠く今待って 正しいことは与えられてた
Wait far away now, the right things were given to us.

462
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,040
送り足を送れたのは君だけ
The only one who could send me off was you.

463
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,540
愛していたい二人じゃなきゃ始まらない
I want to keep loving you, it won't start unless it's the two of us.

464
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,240
歪なステップでもいい 今は君と踊っていたい
Distorted steps are fine, I just want to dance with you right now.

465
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:50,040
ただ生きるためのまじないをそこに残した
I left a charm there just for the sake of living.

466
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,840
命を負ってほしい君と短く長い季節を辿って
I want you to bear this life, as we trace through short and long seasons together.

467
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,040
ないないまで はじめまして あら
Until nothing is left, nice to meet you. Oh?

468
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,248
…だろ
...right?

469
00:30:01,248 --> 00:30:03,448
でもどうしても引き剥がして
But I must tear it away

470
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:08,348
その深い深い瞳に別の色を乗せたい
I want to put a different color in those deep, deep eyes

471
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:12,448
置いてきた空振りを今蹴り飛ばして
Kicking away the swings and misses I left behind

472
00:30:12,448 --> 00:30:14,648
駆けつけるから
Because I'm coming for you

473
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:17,948
甘く淫らに見せるから
Because I'll show you something sweet and lewd

474
00:30:36,148 --> 00:30:40,048
バイバイしても元通りでもない
Even if we say goodbye, it won't be like it was

475
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:44,248
私に成せることはないが
There's nothing I can do, but...

476
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:49,548
でもそうだきっと今更と言って
But that's right, surely you'll say it's too late

477
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,548
仰ぐ
Looking up

478
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:54,248
頷き広がる空から
From the nodding, spreading sky

479
00:30:54,248 --> 00:30:58,348
愛していたい　うっかりしなきゃ始まらない
I want to love; it won't start unless I'm careless

480
00:30:58,348 --> 00:31:03,048
いびつなステップでも今は君と踊っていたい
Even with distorted steps, I want to dance with you now

481
00:31:03,048 --> 00:31:07,748
ただ生きるためのまじないをそこに残した
I left a spell there just for living

482
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:12,348
命を追って欲しい君と短くない季節渡って
I want you to chase life, crossing seasons with you that aren't short

483
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:16,848
バイバイしても元通りでもない
Even if we say goodbye, it won't be like it was

484
00:31:16,848 --> 00:31:21,048
私にできることはあるか
Is there anything I can do?

485
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:25,948
このテンポそうだこんな歌ならどうだ
This tempo, yes, how about a song like this?

486
00:31:25,948 --> 00:31:30,848
だらしなくないけどちょっといいかもね
It's not slovenly, but it might be a bit good

487
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:35,048
もっと響かせて
Make it resonate more

488
00:31:35,048 --> 00:31:40,048
この道に駆けて
Running on this path

489
00:32:07,648 --> 00:32:12,848
ずうっといっしょ！
Together Forever!

490
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:24,348
10年越しても窓の外のせいで手摺り減った
Even after 10 years, the handrail wore down because of the outside window

491
00:32:24,348 --> 00:32:27,748
10年見逃して窓の外見せる変えるなくなった
Overlooking it for 10 years, there's no more showing or changing the outside window

492
00:32:27,748 --> 00:32:31,548
繋ごうよ手と手を背中も引き込んで
Let's join hands, drawing our backs in too

493
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:35,448
お互いに足を引っ張ったお互いに充電した想い出がずうっといっしょ
Pulling each other's legs, recharging each other, memories are always together

494
00:32:42,148 --> 00:32:45,748
3回目の夏誰からも見られていない気がしたんだ
The third summer, I felt like no one was watching me

495
00:32:45,748 --> 00:32:49,248
千々に砕けて昼の街期待しないようにしたんだ
Shattered into pieces, I tried not to expect anything from the city during the day

496
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:52,848
そうやってもう白黒のストイベ自棄になった
Doing that, the black and white event made me desperate

497
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:57,248
あたし面死にたくて仕方ないこんな顔台無しにしたいと思えないもん
I can't help wanting to die, I can't imagine wanting to ruin this face

498
00:32:57,248 --> 00:33:00,848
供に過ごした日々が
The days we spent together

499
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:04,248
鮮やかな幸せが代えの利かないドラマになってたらいいな
I hope the vivid happiness becomes an irreplaceable drama

500
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:10,248
離れ離れなんて誰かが継ぎ接いだバグだよね
Being apart is just a bug someone patched together, right?

501
00:33:10,248 --> 00:33:14,248
あなたの一生の後悔として添い遂げるよ
I'll live out my life as your lifelong regret

You made a mistake with me; it's irreversible

504
00:33:21,148 --> 00:33:25,748

When longing, when stopping, in this inseparable bond, always together

505
00:33:38,948 --> 00:33:42,348
もうちょっと普通に悲しいこと悲しいと思いたかった
I wanted to feel sad things as sad, just a bit more normally

506
00:33:42,348 --> 00:33:46,048
叙情の端に感情隠して楽になりたかった
I wanted to hide my emotions at the edge of lyricism and be at ease

507
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:49,748
精一杯懸命に生きてくださいね
Please live your life as hard as you can

508
00:33:49,748 --> 00:33:53,648
あたし面死にたくて仕方ないあの子の言いなりになんていたくないの
I can't help wanting to die, I don't want to be at that girl's beck and call

509
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:57,148
あなただけひとりで
Just you alone

510
00:33:57,148 --> 00:34:00,648
あたしの目を盗んで幸せになろうなんて思わないで
Don't think about becoming happy behind my back

511
00:34:00,648 --> 00:34:04,148
髪を乾かしてくれた夜から
Since the night you dried my hair

512
00:34:04,148 --> 00:34:07,748
あたしは壊されてんだよ
I've been broken

あなたの一生の後悔として添い遂げるよ
I'll live out my life as your lifelong regret

514
00:34:14,048 --> 00:34:17,448
外れなくなってしまった指輪みたいに
Like a ring that won't come off

515
00:34:17,448 --> 00:34:21,048
今もずっと欲しがっている最低でいてよ
I'm still wanting it; please be the worst

516
00:34:21,048 --> 00:34:24,448
一緒にいた時の方が私可愛かったな
I was cuter when we were together

517
00:34:24,448 --> 00:34:28,048
あなたの一生の後悔として添い遂げるよ
I'll live out my life as your lifelong regret

518

大切なものってなに？胸打したそれ

あたしと間違いを犯したな取り返しがつかないです
You made a mistake with me; it's irreversible

恋焦がれる時も止める時もどん底で眠っていても遅くないわ　墓までずうっといっしょ
When longing, when stopping, even if sleeping at rock bottom, it's not too late. All the way to the grave, always together

521
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,856
ずっといっしょ！
Always together!

惰性で待った成々へ
Towards the results waited for through inertia

527
00:35:49,622 --> 00:35:52,689
生まれ育ち　内側が悪かったせいで

528
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:55,589
全部あなたのせいで
Everything is your fault

529
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:59,389

788
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,280
Want it, want it, want it, opposites go supersonic

I know, I know we're not going down

796
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,580

00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,080
Chronic, chronic, chronic, collide till we go atomic

Want it, want it, want it, opposites go supersonic

Tell me you won't go away

817
00:55:12,088 --> 00:55:13,988
Imagining maybe one day

818
00:55:13,988 --> 00:55:15,588
That we'll meet in between

819
00:55:15,588 --> 00:55:17,688
Organic life and blue screens

820
00:55:17,688 --> 00:55:20,588
I do need you

821
00:55:20,588 --> 00:55:22,588

You'll take me so far

823
00:55:24,588 --> 00:55:26,588
Chronic, collide till we go

824

Want it, want it, want it

827
00:55:31,988 --> 00:55:33,988
Opposites go supersonic

00:55:33,988 --> 00:55:35,488
Love it, love it, love it

829
00:55:35,488 --> 00:55:37,988
