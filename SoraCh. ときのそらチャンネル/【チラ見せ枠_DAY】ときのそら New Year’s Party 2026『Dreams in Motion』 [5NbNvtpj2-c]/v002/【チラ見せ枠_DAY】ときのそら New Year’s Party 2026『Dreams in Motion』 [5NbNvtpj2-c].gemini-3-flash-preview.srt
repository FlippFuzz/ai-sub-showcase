00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:14,674
強がりだって
even when I'm just acting tough,

98
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:19,774
明日の教科書見ずに閉じたら
if I close tomorrow's textbook without looking,

99
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:22,274

136
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:14,026
慌てて飛び出して気づく
I rushed out only to realize...

137
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:16,626
こっちじゃないここどこ？助けてあん肝！
...it's not this way! Where am I? Help me, Ankimo!

138
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:20,926
トラブルばっか転んで起きての毎日です
It's just trouble after trouble, falling and getting up every day.

139
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:25,726
何でも思い通りとかそんな美味しい話はないから
Things going exactly as planned—there's no such sweet deal.

140
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:30,226
心の曇り空を晴らす合言葉唱えて
Reciting the magic words to clear the cloudy skies of the heart...

141
00:15:30,926 --> 00:15:33,826
ほら快晴でしょう！ずっと
See, it's perfectly clear! Always...

142
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:35,826
みんなに届けたい
...I want to reach everyone...

143
00:15:35,826 --> 00:15:38,326
歌もダンスも元気も！
...with my songs, my dance, and my energy!

144
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:40,926
きっとおなじ空の下
Surely, under the same sky...

145
00:15:40,926 --> 00:15:43,126
笑顔も分け合えるよ
...we can share our smiles.

146
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:45,726
ちょっと疲れちゃうときも
Even when I'm a bit tired...

147
00:15:45,726 --> 00:15:48,226
涙が出そうなときも
...or when I'm about to cry...

148
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:50,526
いつも魔法の言葉で
...always with the magic words...

149
00:15:50,526 --> 00:15:53,026
今日もケセラセラのかな
...today is 'Que Sera Sera,' I guess.

150
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:56,526
せーの！ケセラセラ！
One, two! Que Sera Sera!

151
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:08,926
みんなコンそら！
Hello everyone, KonSora!

152
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,226
今日も一日頑張ろう！
Let's do our best again today!

153
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:14,226
カメラにマイクによし準備オッケー！
Camera, mic—all set! Ready, okay!

154
00:16:14,226 --> 00:16:16,226
お水もちゃんとあるし
I've got my water, too.

155
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,726
備えさえあれば嬉しいです
If I'm prepared, I'm happy.

156
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:21,226
それじゃ今日は何をしようかな？
Well then, what should I do today?

157
00:16:21,726 --> 00:16:23,726
お歌に雑談に
Singing, chatting...

158
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:26,226
あ、ほらトラブルだ！
Oh, see, here's some trouble!

159
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:29,226
みんなと笑い飛ばせば
If I laugh it off with everyone...

160
00:16:29,226 --> 00:16:31,526
また明日も晴れ晴れだ！よっしゃ！
...tomorrow will be bright again! Alright!

161
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:52,726
ほっと溜息こぼして
Letting out a soft sigh...

162
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:55,226
ふと夜空を見上げたら
...and happening to look up at the night sky...

163
00:16:55,726 --> 00:16:58,226
ぽっと満天の星たちが
...suddenly, the stars filling the heavens...

164
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,726
キラキラ瞬いていた
...were sparkling and twinkling.

165
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:03,726
ずっと追いかけ続けたい
I want to keep chasing them...

166
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:06,226
雲より高い夢でも
...even if it's a dream higher than the clouds.

167
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,726
もっと強く羽ばたいて
I'll flap my wings even harder...

168
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:11,226
空まで駆けていくよ
...and run all the way to the sky.

169
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,726
そっと背中を押すような
When I'm wrapped in a warmth...

170
00:17:13,726 --> 00:17:16,226
ぬくもりに包まれたら
...that feels like a gentle push on my back...

171
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:18,526
いつまでも止まんないよ
...I'll never stop.

172
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:21,226
今日も今日も、明日も明日も
Today and today, tomorrow and tomorrow...

173
00:17:21,726 --> 00:17:24,226
ずっとケセラセラのかな
...it'll always be 'Que Sera Sera,' I guess.

174
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:26,526
せーの！ケセラセラ！
One, two! Que Sera Sera!

175
00:17:46,626 --> 00:17:48,626
みんなー！
Everyone!

176
00:17:49,126 --> 00:17:51,126
みんなー！
Everyone!

177
00:17:51,826 --> 00:17:54,826
新年明けまして
Happy New Year...

178
00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:58,826
おめでとうございまーす！
...everyone!

179
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:03,926
本日はお寒い中
Thank you for coming today...

180
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:07,926
ありがとうございます。
...despite the cold weather.

181
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:12,926
みんな来れた？あ、来れてるからいるのわかる。
Did everyone make it? Ah, I can see you're here, so of course you did.

182
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:16,926
ちゃんと安全に来れましたかー？
Did you all arrive here safely?

183
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:22,926
え、今回のそらパは、えっと、私のライブ史上最大規模ということで
So, this Sora Party is, well, my biggest live event ever...

184
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:26,926
すごい大きな会場で、あの、ハッシュタグとかも見てたんだけど
It's such a huge venue. I was looking at the hashtags, and...

185
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:30,926
「デカ！」って。
...people were saying, "It's huge!"

186
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:34,226
「デカいのすごいな」って書いてる人がいっぱいいて
Lots of people wrote, "It's amazing how big it is,"

187
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:37,926
私も「デカいな、すごいな」って思いながら見てました。
and I was also thinking "It's big, it's amazing" while looking at it.

188
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:43,226
リハーサルの時は「ここにいっぱいそらともさん来るね」って言われて
During rehearsals, I was told "Lots of Soratomos will come here,"

189
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:46,226
「え、誰もいないじゃん！誰もいないよ！
and I was like, "Wait, there's no one! No one's here!

190
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:51,226
誰もいない…」っていう会話をしながらとっても楽しくやっておりました。
No one..." We were having that kind of conversation and having a lot of fun.

191
00:18:51,726 --> 00:18:57,226
でもみんないるね！ありがとう！
But you're all here! Thank you!

192
00:18:57,726 --> 00:19:00,726
というわけで、今日初めてライブだよって人ー！
So, who's here for their very first live event?

193
00:19:00,726 --> 00:19:03,226
おおー、結構いるね！
Ooh, quite a few of you!

Er, can we do the thing with the penlights?

204
