a direct route,

158
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:13,774
明日の教科書
tomorrow's textbook.

159
00:14:13,774 --> 00:14:16,774
水に流したら　何だってやれそうだ
If we wash it away, feels like we can do anything.

160
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,774
落書きの
Inside the doodles...

161
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,774
中光ってた想いを
...the feelings were shining.

162
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:24,274
君とこうして話せたなんて
That I could talk with you like this...

163
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:28,274
嘘みたいだな　もっと
...feels like a lie. More!

164
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:31,274
また書いて消して
Writing again and erasing.

165
00:14:49,774 --> 00:14:52,774
みんな行くよ！せーの！
Everyone, let's go! Ready, set, go!

166
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:55,274
奇跡の空！
Miraculous Sky (Sora)!

167
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,226
おはよう こんにちはも ご挨拶
Good morning, hello, and greetings too.

168
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:06,826
ってあれ？ 嘘 もうこんな時間？
Wait, huh? No way, is it already this time?

169
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:09,326
午後から予定あるのに
I have plans starting in the afternoon,

170
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:11,326
すぐに支度をしなきゃ
I have to get ready right away.

171
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:12,626
行ってきます！
I'm off!

172
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:15,126
慌てて飛び出して気付く
I rush out in a panic and realize,

173
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:17,626
こっちじゃない そこだと
It's not this way, it's over there!

174
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,026
駆けて行きます
I'm running there!

175
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:21,826
トラブルばっか 転んで起きての
It's nothing but trouble, falling down and getting up,

176
00:15:21,826 --> 00:15:22,826
毎日です
that's my everyday life.

177
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:25,826
なんでも思い通りとか
Having everything go exactly as planned,

178
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,326
そんな美味しい話はないけど
there's no such lucky story like that.

179
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:30,826
心の曇り空
But the cloudy skies of my heart,

180
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:32,326
晴らす合言葉
with a password to clear them up,

181
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:33,826
唱えて
chant it out,

182
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:35,326
ほら 快晴でしょ
look, it's clear weather!

183
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:36,326
ずっと！
Always!

184
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:37,826
みんなに届けたい
I want to reach everyone,

185
00:15:38,026 --> 00:15:40,326
歌もダンスも元気も
my songs, my dance, and my energy!

186
00:15:40,826 --> 00:15:42,326
きっと同じ空の下
Surely under the same sky,

187
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:44,826
笑顔も分け合えるよ
we can share our smiles too.

188
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:46,826
ちょっと疲れちゃう時も
Even when you get a little tired,

189
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:49,326
涙が出そうな時も
or when tears are about to fall,

190
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:52,326
いつも魔法の言葉で 今日も
always use the magic words, today too.

191
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,826
ケセラセラだから
Because it's Que Sera Sera,

192
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:57,326
さあ 絆 奏でて
come on, let's play the melody of our bond!

193
00:15:57,326 --> 00:16:02,826
High! High! High!...

194
00:16:06,826 --> 00:16:09,326
みんな 今日も一日頑張ろう
Everyone, let's do our best today too!

195
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:12,326
カメラにマイクに よし準備OK
Camera, mic, alright preparations OK!

196
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:14,326
お水もちゃんとあるし
I have my water too,

197
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:17,326
備えさえあれば憂いなし ね
if you're prepared, there's no worry, right?

198
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:19,826
それじゃ今日は何をしようかな
So then, what shall we do today?

199
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:22,326
お歌に雑談に あ ほらこれだね
Singing, chatting... Ah, look, this is it!

200
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:24,826
みんなと笑い飛ばせば
If I laugh it off with everyone,

201
00:16:25,126 --> 00:16:27,326
また明日も晴れ渡る
tomorrow will be clear and sunny again!

202
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:28,826
よっしゃ！
Alright!

203
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,826
みんな声出して！
Everyone, shout it out!

204
00:16:50,826 --> 00:16:53,326
ホッとため息こぼして
Breathing a sigh of relief,

205
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:55,826
ふと夜空を見上げたら
when I suddenly looked up at the night sky,

206
00:16:56,326 --> 00:16:58,326
パッと満点の星たちが
suddenly a perfect score of stars,

207
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:00,826
キラキラ瞬いてた
were twinkling brightly.

208
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:02,326
ずっと！
Forever!

209
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:03,826
追いかけ続けたい
I want to keep chasing after it,

210
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:06,326
今日より高い夢でも
even if the dream is higher than today.

211
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,826
もっと強く羽ばたいて
Flapping my wings more strongly,

212
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:11,326
空まで駆けていくよ
I will run all the way to the sky.

213
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:13,326
そっと背中押すような
Like gently pushing my back,

214
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:15,826
温もり見つけたから
because I found that warmth.

215
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:18,826
いつまでもそばにいるよ
I will be by your side forever,

216
00:17:18,826 --> 00:17:20,326
今日も！
today!

217
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:21,826
明日も！
and tomorrow!

218
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:22,826
ずっと！
Always!

219
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,326
ケセラセラだから
Because it's Que Sera Sera,

220
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:27,826
さあ 絆 奏でて
come on, let's play the melody of our bond!

221
00:17:27,826 --> 00:17:32,826
High! High! High!...

222
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:49,826
みんな... みんな...
Everyone... Everyone...

223
00:17:50,826 --> 00:17:55,326
新年！明けまして おめでとうございます！
Happy New Year!

224
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:06,826
本日は お寒い中 ありがとうございます
Thank you for coming today in this cold weather.

225
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:10,326
みんな来れた？
Did you all make it here?

226
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:11,826
あ 来れてるからいるのわかってる
Ah, you're here so I know you made it.

227
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:15,826
あの ちゃんと安全に来れましたか？
Um, did you make it here safely?

228
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:20,326
え 今回のソラパは
So, this time's Sorapa is,

229
00:18:20,826 --> 00:18:24,826
私のライブ史上 最大規模ということで
the largest scale live performance in my history,

230
00:18:25,326 --> 00:18:27,326
すごいおっきな会場で
at such a huge venue.

231
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:32,326
あの ハッシュタグとかも見てたんだけど 「でっか！」って
I was looking at the hashtags and people were saying "Huge!"

232
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:35,826
「でかいな すごいな」って書いてる人がいっぱいいて
There were lots of people writing "It's huge, it's amazing".

233
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:39,326
私も「でかいな すごいな」って思いながら見てました
I was also watching while thinking "It's huge, it's amazing".

234
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:43,826
リハーサルの時は ここにいっぱいそらともさん来るねって言われて
During rehearsal, I was told "lots of Soratomos will come here",

235
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:45,826
え 誰もいないじゃん！
and I was like "Eh, nobody's here!"

236
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:47,826
誰もいないよ！ 誰もいない！
Nobody's here! Nobody's here!

237
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,826
っていう会話をしながら
While having that conversation,

238
00:18:49,826 --> 00:18:51,826
とても楽しくやっておりました
we were doing it very happily.

239
00:18:52,026 --> 00:18:54,826
でもみんないるね！ ありがとう！
But everyone is here! Thank you!

240
00:18:57,826 --> 00:19:01,826
というわけで 今日初めてライブだよって人！
So, who is here for their first live today?

241
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:05,826
おお 結構いるね
Oh, quite a few.

242
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:10,826
じゃあ 現地自体初めてだよって人
Then, who is at a venue for the first time?

243
00:19:11,826 --> 00:19:14,326
結構いる！ ありがとう
Quite a few! Thank you.

244
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:18,826
じゃあ 頑張って あの手振るだけでいいからね
Then, do your best... just waving your hand is fine.

245
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,826
あの 女の子！
Um... Girls!

246
00:19:24,826 --> 00:19:28,826
おお！ 声出してくれてありがとう 「きゃー」って聞こえた
Oh! Thanks for shouting. I heard "Kyaa!".

247
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:32,826
可愛い！ 大好き！
Cute! I love you!

248
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:36,326
ありがとうございます
Thank you very much.

249
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:40,826
え これってペンライトとかできるのかな？
Eh, can we do the penlight thing?

250
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:42,826
あ できないのかな？
Ah, maybe we can't?

251
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:47,826
こちらの人 赤！
People on this side, Red!

252
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:54,826
こちらの人は 青！
People on this side, Blue!

00:19:57,826 --> 00:19:59,826
真ん中は 黄色！
The middle is Yellow!

254
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:09,987
こんな感じでですね
Just like this...

255
00:20:10,187 --> 00:20:12,887
今日はペンライトでも遊べちゃうということで
Since we can play with penlights today,

256
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:15,687
ぜひぜひみんなでも楽しんでいきましょう
let's all have fun together!

257
00:20:18,187 --> 00:20:20,587
今日はみんなも主役だよ！
Today, everyone is the main character too!

258
00:20:34,287 --> 00:20:35,887
お水かわいい！
Drinking water is cute!

259
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:36,587
ありがとう
Thank you.

260
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:40,887
もうちょっと飲む
I'll drink a little more.

261
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:44,587
まだ飲んでない！
I haven't drunk it yet!

262
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:50,287
すぐお水だって分かったじゃん
You knew it was water right away.

263
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:51,587
後ろ向いたから？
Because I turned around?

264
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,887
えへへ、ありがとう
Ehehe, thank you.

265
00:20:58,287 --> 00:21:01,087
さあ、というわけでね
Well then...

266
00:21:01,087 --> 00:21:03,887
今日はいかがだったでしょうかとはいかないので
I can't exactly ask "how was it today?" just yet,

267
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:05,587
始まったばっかり！
because it just started!

268
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:09,287
なんですが！
However!

269
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:12,587
なんと... もう言っていいのかな？
Surprisingly... is it okay to say it already?

270
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:15,587
YouTubeの配信は...
The YouTube stream is...

271
00:21:16,587 --> 00:21:17,587
なんと...
actually...

272
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:19,887
ここまでなんです
ending here.

00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:24,887
分かってるばっかり！
You all know it already!

274
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:28,587
でも続き見たい人は...
But for those who want to see the rest...

275
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,587
どこだここ... ここら辺に...
where is it... somewhere around here...

276
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:35,287
からあのチケットが...
the tickets...

277
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,087
買うって言い方やだ
I don't like saying "buy".

278
00:21:37,187 --> 00:21:38,587
見に来てね！
Come watch!

279
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:56,287
というわけで、先にどんどん行ってみましょうか！
