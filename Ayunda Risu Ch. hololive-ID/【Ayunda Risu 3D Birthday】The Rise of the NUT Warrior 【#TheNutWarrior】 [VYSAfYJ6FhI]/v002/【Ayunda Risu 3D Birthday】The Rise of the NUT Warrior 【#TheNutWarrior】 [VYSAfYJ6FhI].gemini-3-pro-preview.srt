00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,500
In a kingdom far far away

3
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,200
where all nyut-nyut lives,

4
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
A sudden calamity strikes

5
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,000
among the nyut-nyut who lives in harmony.

6
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,000
A pink giant monster has emerged out of nowhere

7
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and created havoc everywhere.

8
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,800
A lot of buildings and villages were destroyed.

9
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,800
All nyut-nyut were left hopeless

10
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,000
until a mysterious magical squirrel arrived

11
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
to find a legendary weapon, the Nut Blade.

12
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,000
The legend said that this mysterious squirrel

13
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,500
will bring an end to this calamity...

14
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,000
強くなれる
I learned the reason...

15
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,200
理由を知った
...to be strong.

16
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,000
僕を連れて
Take me with you...

17
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,800
進め
...and move forward.

19
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:12,348
泥だらけの走馬灯に酔う
I get drunk on the muddy revolving lantern.

20

21
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:20,581

夜の匂いに
In the scent of the night,

24
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:27,714

Even if I glare at the sky,

25
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:32,648
変わっていけるのは自分自身だけ
The only one who can change things is myself.

26
00:05:33,548 --> 00:05:35,348

I learned the reason to be strong.

28

紅蓮の華よ 咲き誇れ
Oh crimson lotus flower, bloom proudly!

36
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:15,814
運命を照らして
Illuminate my destiny.

37
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:27,848
イナビカリの雑音が耳を刺す
The noise of lightning pierces my ears.

38
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:32,214
戸惑う心 優しいだけじゃ
A bewildered heart; with kindness alone,

39
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:34,881
守れないものがある
There are things I cannot protect.

40
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:36,981
わかってるけど
I understand that, but...

41
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:40,148
水面下で絡まる善悪
Good and evil entangled beneath the surface,

42

透けて見える偽善に天罰
Divine punishment for the visible hypocrisy.

43
00:06:42,114 --> 00:06:43,314
(Tell me why, Tell me why, Tell me why, Tell me why)

44
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:44,514
I don't need you!

45
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:46,448
逸材の花より
Rather than a talented flower,

46
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:49,848
挑み続け咲いた一輪が美しい
A single flower that kept challenging and bloomed is beautiful.

47
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:53,748
乱暴に敷き詰められた
On this roughly paved,

48
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,248
トゲだらけの道も
Thorn-covered path,

49
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:59,481

It appears only because I am serious.

乗り越えて
I will overcome it,

I'll show you.

00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:14,581
この血に

55
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:16,681
宿って
Dwell.

56
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:35,181
人知れず儚い 散りゆく結末
A fleeting, scattering ending unknown to anyone.

57
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:39,348
無情に破れた 悲鳴の風吹く
Ruthlessly torn, the wind of screams blows.

誰かの笑う影
Someone's laughing shadow,

59
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:51,081

62
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,914

And the present that cannot be stopped,

00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:07,148

If I can become strong for someone else,

64

Oh crimson lotus flower, bloom proudly!

68
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:23,714

運命を
My destiny...

70
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:36,048
照らして
...Illuminate it.

71
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:08,581
Oh no...

72
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,181
Everything is burned down.

73
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:14,414
My house and the entire village is destroyed.

74
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,681
What is going on?

75
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:17,948
Are you alright?

76
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:19,948
A giant monster...

77
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:23,648
Burned down my entire village with its fire breath.

78
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:25,181
That is bad.

79
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:27,714
Do you know where that monster is heading?

80
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:30,114
I think it's headed to the next village.

81
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:31,714
Don't worry.

82
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:34,848
I shall take care of it for you so it won't destroy the other village too.

83
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:36,314
In order to do that,

84
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:39,348
I need to collect power by singing and music.

85
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:43,381
So please, lend me your power, oh dear villager.

86
00:09:44,214 --> 00:09:45,348
Oh, I will.

00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,100
この道を訪れる
visit this path.

334
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,600
そして僕は今日もずっと
And I will today too, all along,

335
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,200
見守るしかできない
only be able to watch over you.

336
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,700
君はあの木の先で
Beyond that tree,

337
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,200
いつも通り隠れてる
you are hiding as usual.

338
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,500
私は気付かぬフリしたまま
I pretended not to notice

339
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,100
通り過ぎた
as I walked past.

340
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,500
視線は
Our gazes...

341
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,800
絡まない
...don't meet.

342
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,200
声は
Our voices...

343
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,700
届かない
...don't reach.

344
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,500
ため息だけが虚しく重なる
Only our sighs overlap in vain.

345
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,900
会えなくたって
Even if we can't meet,

346
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,800
触れなくたって
even if we can't touch,

347
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,500
話せなくたって
even if we can't talk...

348
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,100
いいから
it's okay.

349
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,300
頼りない君とぎこちない僕が
You, who are unreliable, and I, who am awkward...

350
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,700
そこにいるだけでいいんだ
it's enough just to be there.

351
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,400
これが恋だと言わないなら
If you don't call this love,

352
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,900
言葉なんてなくていい
then words aren't needed.

353
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,600
ああ考えたって、考えたって
Ah, even if I think about it, even if I think about it,

354
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,300
エンディングは変わらない
the ending won't change.

355
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,600
会いたかったんだ
I wanted to meet you.

356
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,400
触れたかったんだ
I wanted to touch you.

357
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,000
話したかった
I wanted to talk.

358
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,700
本当は
The truth is...

359
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,900
かわいい君と優しい僕が
You, who are cute, and I, who am kind...

360
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,200
出会い結ばれるエンド
an ending where we meet and are united.

361
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,100
何回だって
Again and again,

362
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,100
何回だって
again and again,

363
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,700
神様に願ったよ
I prayed to God.

364
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,100
でも悲しいくらい
But it's so sad,

365
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,400
悲しいくらい
it's so sad,

366
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,200
狼と赤ずきんなんだ
that we are the wolf and Little Red Riding Hood.

367
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,900
泣いてる君を慰めたくて
I wanted to comfort you crying.

368
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,300
伸ばした腕が震える
My outstretched arm trembles.

369
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,300
愛しているよ
I love you.

370
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,300
抱きしめたいよ
I want to hold you.

371
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,100
だけどできないんだよ
But I can't do it.

372
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,100
どう足掻いたって
No matter how much I struggle,

373
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,000
どう願ったって
no matter how much I wish,

374
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,800
爪も牙も消えない
my claws and fangs won't disappear.

375
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,500
だからただ待ってるよ
So I'll just wait

376
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,100
君の涙が止むまで
until your tears stop.

377
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,300
あの木の先で
Beyond that tree...

378
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,900
ずっと
...forever.

379
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,100
Ah, here you go!

380
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,800
If you eat this, you can recover super quick.

381
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,400
感謝する。
My thanks.

382
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,500
よし、完全回復だ。
Alright, full recovery.

383
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,800
今すぐ怪獣のもとへ、案内しよう。
I will guide you to the monster right now.

384
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,400
Okay, let's go!

385

A scarred young bird is staring...

392
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:30,675
睨んでる

心を無にして
Emptying my mind,

396
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:49,475
向かい風に乗り
Riding the headwind,

助走をつけて
I gain momentum.
