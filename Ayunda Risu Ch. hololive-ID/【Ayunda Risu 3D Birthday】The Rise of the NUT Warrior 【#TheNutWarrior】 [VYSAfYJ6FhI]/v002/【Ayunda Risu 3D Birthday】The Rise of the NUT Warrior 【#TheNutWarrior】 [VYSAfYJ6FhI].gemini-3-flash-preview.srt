00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,800
In a kingdom far far away where all nyut-nyut lives,

3
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,500
A sudden calamity strikes among the nyut-nyut who lives in harmony.

4
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
A pink giant monster has emerged out of nowhere and created havoc everywhere.

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,500
A lot of buildings and villages were destroyed.

6
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,500
All nyut-nyut were left hopeless until a mysterious magical squirrel arrived to find a legendary weapon, the Nut Blade.

7
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,500

夜の匂いに
In the smell of night

15
00:05:25,014 --> 00:05:28,848

(I'll spend all thirty nights) Even if I glare at the sky

No matter what, a dream I can't erase, a present I can't stop

20
00:05:54,014 --> 00:05:57,714

Good and evil intertwined beneath the surface, divine punishment for the transparent hypocrisy

29
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:43,648
(Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why, tell me... I don't need you!)

30
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:49,481
逸材の華より 挑み続け咲いた一輪が美しい
More beautiful than a flower of rare talent, is the single flower that kept on challenging to bloom

31
00:06:50,114 --> 00:06:54,281
乱暴に敷き詰められた 棘だらけの道も
Even a road roughly covered in thorns

32
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,514

紅蓮の華よ咲き誇れ
Guren flower, bloom in glory

46
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:27,014
運命を照らして
Light up my fate

47
00:08:31,014 --> 00:08:33,548
運命を照らして
Light up my fate

48
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:07,814
Oh no!

49
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,914
Everything is burned down.

50
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:13,914
My house and the entire village is destroyed.

51
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,448
What is going on?

52
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,648
Are you alright?

53
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:19,981
A giant monster...

54
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:23,548
...burned down my entire village with its fire breath.

55
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:25,514
That is bad.

56
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:27,648
Do you know where that monster is heading?

57
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:31,148
I think it's headed to the next village.

58
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:32,181
Don't worry.

59
00:09:32,381 --> 00:09:35,081
I shall take care of it for you so it won't destroy the other village too.

60
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:39,414
In order to do that, I need to collect power by singing and music.

61
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,648
So please, lend me your power, oh dear villager.

62
00:09:44,214 --> 00:09:45,048
Oh, I will!

63
00:10:03,823 --> 00:10:07,523

泣き声も 届かないと
Lamenting that my cries

128
00:17:22,211 --> 00:17:28,211

As a testament that

132
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:50,511

風が雲を流して
The wind sweeps the clouds away...

134

00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:51,711
集めに行こう
I'll go to collect them.

143
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:49,211
Oh, I think after all this singing,

144
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:54,211
my power is still not enough to defeat the giant pink monster.

145
00:19:55,511 --> 00:19:57,911
I heard you, young warrior.

146
00:19:58,211 --> 00:20:01,711
I can help you with your worry.

147
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:04,452
As I, the keeper of the legendary weapon Nut Blade,

148
00:20:04,652 --> 00:20:07,052
will lend you its power.

149
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:10,852
Is this... the voice of the Fireblade Priestess?

150
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:15,052
Yes, you are right.

151
00:20:15,152 --> 00:20:18,752
I will lend you the power of this Nut Blade

152
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:22,252
if you can prove yourself that you have the spirit to fight the pink giant monster.

153
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:24,752
Hah! Okay!

00:24:57,252 --> 00:24:59,752
If my hunch was right... I think...

221
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,450
I should go through the forest next.

222
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,800

226
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,600
任せておけ。
Leave it to me.

227
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:59,100
おおかみは赤ずきんに恋をした
The Wolf Fell in Love with Little Red Riding Hood

228

かよわい君と　鋭い僕が　出会う　それが終わりさ
When frail you and sharp me meet, that's the end

236
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:46,500

Even if you call it cruel or revile it, fate will not change

237

Surely you will visit this road again today

239
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:11,000
そして僕は今日も　ずっと見守るしかできない
And I can do nothing but watch over you today as well

00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,100
君はあの木の先で　いつも通り隠れてる
You are hiding beyond that tree, just like always

私は気づかぬふりしたまま　通り過ぎた
I passed by while pretending not to notice

242
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,500
視線は　交わらない　声は　届かない
Our gazes don't meet, our voices don't reach

243
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,500
ため息だけが　虚しく重なる
Only sighs overlap in vain

244
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,500
会えなくたって　触れなくたって　話せなくたって　いいから
It's okay even if we can't meet, can't touch, or can't talk

245
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:41,400
頼りない君と　ぎこちない僕が　そこにいるだけでいいんだ
It's enough just for frail you and awkward me to be there

246
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,500
これが恋だって　言わないなら　言葉なんてなくていい
If you won't call this love, then words aren't needed

247
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,500
考えたって　考えたって　エンディングは変わらない
No matter how much I think, the ending won't change

248
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,400
会いたかったんだ　触れたかったんだ　話したかった　本当は
I wanted to meet you, I wanted to touch you, I wanted to talk to you, truth be told

249
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,400
かわいい君と　優しい僕が　出会い　結ばれるエンド
An end where cute you and kind me meet and are tied together

250
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,400
何回だって　何回だって　神様に願ったよ
Time and time again, I prayed to God

251
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,400
でも　悲しいくらい　悲しいくらい　おおかみと赤ずきんなんだ
But, sadly, so sadly, we are the Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood

252
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,800
泣いている君を　慰めたくて　伸ばした腕が震える
Wanting to comfort you who are crying, my outstretched arm trembles

253
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,600
愛しているよ　抱きしめたいよ　だけど　できないんだよ
I love you, I want to hold you, but I can't

254
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,900
どうあがいたって　どう願ったって　爪も牙も消えない
No matter how I struggle, no matter how I pray, my claws and fangs won't disappear

255
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,900
だから　ただ待ってるよ　君の涙が止むまで　あの木の先で
So I'll just wait, until your tears stop, beyond that tree

256
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,500
Ah, here it is! If you eat this, you can recover super quick!

257
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,300

466
00:46:42,192 --> 00:46:43,892
And next, we have this.

467
00:46:44,892 --> 00:46:46,392
Squirrel Smartphone Ring

468
00:46:46,192 --> 00:46:48,392
Whoa, a smartphone ring!

469
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:51,392
Ooh! So you can be super comfortable

470
00:46:51,692 --> 00:46:54,392
and remember me when you're holding your phone.

471
00:46:54,892 --> 00:46:57,892
And it also will secure your phone in your hand.

472
00:47:00,592 --> 00:47:02,892
Very, very convenient.

473
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:07,892
And I think, let's see the full set now.

474
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:11,892
Whoo! Whoa, there's so much stuff actually.

475
00:47:12,892 --> 00:47:14,192
And also, don't forget,

476
00:47:14,892 --> 00:47:18,192
we have the full set purchase bonus here!

477
00:47:18,392 --> 00:47:21,392
Set Purchase Bonus

478
00:47:21,392 --> 00:47:23,392
So I will explain it a little bit.

479
00:47:23,892 --> 00:47:27,192
For those of you who purchase the full set

480
00:47:27,692 --> 00:47:31,892
will also receive a signed foil-stamped postcard.

481
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,592
And for my super Risuners

482
00:47:35,392 --> 00:47:37,892
who purchase the limited edition full set

483
00:47:38,392 --> 00:47:40,892
will receive a postcard autographed

484
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,892
by none other than me!

485
00:47:44,392 --> 00:47:45,592
Autographed by me!

486
00:47:45,892 --> 00:47:47,892
Isn't it awesome? Whoa!

487
00:47:49,892 --> 00:47:52,592
And the pre-order window is only a month,

488
00:47:52,892 --> 00:47:55,892
so make sure that you don't miss it.

489
00:47:57,192 --> 00:47:59,192
Oh, oh, oh, also one more thing!

490
00:47:59,892 --> 00:48:03,192
Did you guys listen to my new original song,

491
00:48:03,692 --> 00:48:05,892
Hoshiga Furu?

492
00:48:06,892 --> 00:48:10,192
It will be officially released after this stream

493
00:48:10,892 --> 00:48:13,892
at midnight JST. JST, okay?

494
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:16,392
On my YouTube channel.

495
00:48:16,892 --> 00:48:18,892
So go listen to it and,

496
00:48:19,392 --> 00:48:21,892
um, maybe who knows that later

497
00:48:22,192 --> 00:48:25,192
we will have MV for it? I don't know!

498
00:48:26,892 --> 00:48:28,592
And last but not least,

499
00:48:28,892 --> 00:48:31,692
for all of you who joined my membership,

500
00:48:31,892 --> 00:48:34,892

00:48:38,192 --> 00:48:41,192
just right after this show has ended.

503
00:48:42,392 --> 00:48:44,892
