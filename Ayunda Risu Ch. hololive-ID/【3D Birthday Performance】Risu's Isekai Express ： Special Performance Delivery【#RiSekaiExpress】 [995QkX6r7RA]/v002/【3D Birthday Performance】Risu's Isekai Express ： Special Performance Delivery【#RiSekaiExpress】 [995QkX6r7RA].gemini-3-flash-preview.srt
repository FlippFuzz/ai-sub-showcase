Langsung aja ke lagu pertama nggak sih?
Should we just go straight to the first song?

26
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,608
Eh, bentar guys, bentar.
Eh, wait guys, wait.

27
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:40,708

Risu angkat dulu bentar ya guys.
Risu will pick it up for a moment, guys.

29
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,308
Hari itu kulihat langit sore
That day I saw the evening sky

30
00:06:04,308 --> 00:06:07,708
Berandai jika aku seorang peri
Wondering if I were a fairy

31
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:11,008
Kan ku terbang langsung kunjungi mu
I would fly straight to visit you

32
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:14,308
Lewat lembah gurun bersahdu
Through valleys and serene deserts

33
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:18,008
Meskipun raporku selalu merah
Even though my report card is always red

34
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:21,208
Aku mau jadi fisikawan
I want to be a physicist

35
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,508
Kan ku hilangkan jarak dan waktu
I will eliminate distance and time

36
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:27,708
Agar aku selalu bersamamu
So that I can always be with you

37
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:31,508
Walau hanya sebatas video call saja
Even if it's just a video call

38
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:34,808
Sebatas kirim foto kucing saja
Just sending cat photos

39
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:38,308
Sebatas ucapan pagi, oh senangnya
Just a morning greeting, oh how happy

40
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:42,008
Lama-lama memupuk jadi cinta
Gradually nurturing into love

41
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:59,808
Malam itu kau ajakku berkencan
That night you asked me on a date

42
00:06:59,808 --> 00:07:03,008
Di atas perahu Venesia
Aboard a boat in Venice

43
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:06,508
Tak sengaja tangan kita berdua bertemu
Accidentally, both our hands met

44
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:09,108
Rasaku menggebu di dada
My feelings surge in my chest

45
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:10,508
Doki-doki

46
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:13,808
Kuingat ku akan mimpi malam tadi
I remember I would dream of last night

47
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,008
Namun hari kini sudah pagi
But now it's already morning

48
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:20,308
Mungkin tak lama lagi kita berjumpa
Maybe soon we will meet

49
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:23,008
Arungi angan ku bersamamu
Navigating my dreams with you

50
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,508

00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:36,508
Sebatas kirim foto kucing saja
Just sending cat photos

65
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:23,208
忘れられぬものだけが美しくはないのでしょう
It's not just the things we can't forget that are beautiful, is it?

66
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:28,208
忘れることばかりが美しくはないでしょう
It's not just the act of forgetting that is beautiful, is it?

67
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:33,208
哀しいことばかりが人生ではないのでしょう
It's not just the sad things that make a life, is it?

68
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:37,008
二人で得た喜びとは比べゆくでしょう
They will be compared to the joy we found together

69
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:40,008
船よ船よ　荒海の中で
Oh boat, oh boat, in the midst of the rough seas

70
00:09:40,008 --> 00:09:43,308
流されず居られたでしょうか
Were you able to stay without being swept away?

71
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:46,808
皆そこに座す　あなたと尖った衝動自在
Everyone sitting there, with you and sharp, free impulses

72
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:50,308
サヨナラするこの知られとは
What is known of this farewell...

73
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:51,508
万象
The universe

74
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,008
痛みの数数えて
Counting the number of pains

75
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:56,508
傷の数指を折る
Counting the wounds on my fingers

76
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:59,008
一つ余り小指は愛しさだなんて
One left over, the pinky finger is for 'beloved'...

77
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:01,508
辛いこともありましょう
There will be hardships

78
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:03,008
あなたのせいもありましょう
And it might be your fault too

79
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,216
それでも赤い糸
Even so, the red thread of fate

80
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:03,516
繋いでいるのでしょう
...must be tying us together.

81
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,516
底知れぬものだけに 怯えるのではないでしょう
One shouldn't fear things just because they are bottomless, right?

82
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:23,816
届かぬものばかりが 妬ましくはないでしょう
It's not as if only the unreachable things are enviable.

83
00:10:23,816 --> 00:10:27,116
優しいことばかりが 優しさではないのでしょう
Gentleness is not just about being kind, is it?

84
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:30,416
さりとて赤裸々では こそばゆいのでしょう
Yet, being completely naked is a bit ticklish, isn't it?

85
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:33,716
跳ねよ跳ねよ 人波を望み
Leap, leap, longing for the crowd of people.

86
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:37,016
人波に拒まれては
And being rejected by the crowd...

87
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:40,416
皆そこ目指す 未だ勝手な場所
Everyone aims for that place, a place that's still selfish.

88
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,616
傍若無人であいた頃を
Back when we were insolent and arrogant.

89
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:47,316
遠吠えとわ Let's go
What is called a howl? Let's go!

90
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:51,616
髪の長さ揃えて 爪の先を塗り直す
Trimming my hair and repainting my nails.

91
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:54,816
あどけない唇も 色めき立つその目
My innocent lips and those eyes that light up.

92
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:58,216
語らうこともありましょう 語らぬ人もおりましょう
There will be times when we talk, and there will be those who don't.

93
00:10:58,216 --> 00:11:02,016
それゆえ慰めなど もう要られないのでしょう
That's why comforts are probably no longer needed.

94
00:11:02,016 --> 00:11:05,416
跳ねよ跳ねよ 皆共に散って
Leap, leap, let us all scatter together.

95
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,616
既知の数数えて 痛みの数指折る
Counting the known things, counting the pains on my fingers.

96
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,916
一つ余り小指は 愛おしさらばね
The one left over pinky finger is for love.

97
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:46,316
悔やむこともありましょう 私の所為もありましょう
There will be regrets, and some will be my fault.

98
00:11:46,316 --> 00:11:49,616
いつかは赤い糸 断ち切るのでしょう
One day, the red thread will probably be cut.

99
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:53,016
花びらに囁きを 憐れみから口づけを
Whispers to the petals, a kiss out of pity.

100
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:56,316
懐かしくて初めて 咲き退けるのでしょう
It's nostalgic, and for the first time, it will bloom and fall.

101
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,616
迷うこともありましょう 誰かの所為じゃないでしょう
There will be times of doubt, and it won't be anyone's fault.

102
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:03,116
難しいものですね 愛するということは
It's a difficult thing, isn't it? This thing called loving.

103
00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:36,316
君の虜になってしまえばきっと
If I become captivated by you, I'm sure...

104
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:39,616
この夏は充実するのもっと
...this summer will be much more fulfilling.

105
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:43,016
噂のドリーミンガール忘れないで
Don't forget the rumored "Dreamin' Girl".

106
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:51,516
summertime

107
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:54,016
Lyrics: 原田夏樹, 鈴木まりこ Music: 原田夏樹
Lyrics: Natsuki Harada, Mariko Suzuki Music: Natsuki Harada

108
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:07,116
何年経っても言えない
Even after years pass, I can't say it.

109
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:10,516
後悔したって構わない
I don't mind even if I regret it.

110
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:13,816
でも言葉はここまで出てるの
But the words are right on the tip of my tongue.

111
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:17,016
ねえ サマータイム
Hey, summertime.

112
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:21,816
海岸通りを歩きたい
I want to walk along the coastal road.

113
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:25,116
ドライブだってしてみたい
I even want to go for a drive.

114
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:28,516
ただ視線を合わせてほしいの
I just want our eyes to meet.

115
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,716
ねえ サマータイム
Hey, summertime.

116
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:36,516
夜明けまで海辺走って
Running along the beach until dawn.

117
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:39,816
潮騒に包まれたいね
I want to be enveloped by the sound of the tide.

118
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:43,016
彼女の仕草が
Her gestures...

119
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:46,316
甘いね
...are sweet, aren't they?

120
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:49,616
君の虜になってしまえばきっと
If I become captivated by you, I'm sure...

121
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:53,016
この夏は充実するのもっと
...this summer will be much more fulfilling.

122
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:56,316
噂のドリーミンガール忘れないで
Don't forget the rumored "Dreamin' Girl".

123
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:03,916
でも気持ちを伝えてしまえばいつか
But if I tell you how I feel, then one day...

124
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:07,316
この夢は覚めてしまうだろうな
...this dream will probably come to an end.

125
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:10,516
青い影が揺れる街角
At the street corner where blue shadows sway.

126
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,716
占いなんて信じない
I don't believe in things like fortune-telling.

127
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:23,016
運命なんてあるわけない
There's no way things like "fate" exist.

128
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:26,416
ただ本当のことを知りたいの
I just want to know the truth.

129
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,616
ねえ サマータイム
Hey, summertime.

130
00:14:31,116 --> 00:14:34,416
近づく距離にも気づかない
Not even noticing the distance getting shorter.

131
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,816
胸の高鳴り誤魔化せない
I can't hide the throbbing of my heart.

132
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:41,016
でも昔と変わらず鈍いの
But you're just as slow as you used to be.

133
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:44,316
ねえ サマータイム
Hey, summertime.

134
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:49,116
思い出は色褪せたって
Even if memories have faded...

135
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:52,416
惚れた腫れたの中がいいね
...being head over heels is good, isn't it?

136
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,616
彼女の笑顔が
Her smile...

137
00:14:55,616 --> 00:14:58,916
憎いね
...is frustrating, isn't it?

138
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,016
君の虜に...
Captivated by you...

139
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,224
君の虜になってしまえばきっと
If I were to become your prisoner, surely...

140
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:07,524
この夏は充実するもおっと
...this summer would be even more fulfilling.

141
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:12,324
噂のドリーミンガール忘れないで
Don't forget the rumored Dreamin' Girl.

142
00:15:12,324 --> 00:15:15,524
でも気持ちを伝えてしまえばいつか
But if I convey my feelings, someday...

143
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:19,524
この夢は覚めてしまうだろうな
...this dream will probably wake up.

144
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:24,324
青い影が揺れる
A blue shadow sways.

145
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,524
Ah!

146
00:15:38,824 --> 00:15:41,824
君の虜になってしまえばきっと
If I were to become your prisoner, surely...

147
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:46,324
この夏は充実するもおっと
...this summer would be even more fulfilling.

148
00:15:46,324 --> 00:15:51,324
噂のドリーミンガール忘れないで
Don't forget the rumored Dreamin' Girl.

149
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:54,324
でも気持ちを伝えてしまえばいつか
But if I convey my feelings, someday...

150
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:59,324
この夢は覚めてしまうだろうな
...this dream will probably wake up.

151
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:05,424
青い影が揺れる街角
A blue shadow sways on the street corner.

152
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:08,524
Summertime...

153
00:16:52,364 --> 00:16:54,024
Wah!
Whoa!

154
00:16:54,824 --> 00:16:57,924
Telolet telolet telolet telolet telolet!

155
00:16:57,924 --> 00:17:00,424
Gimana lagunya barusan guys?
How was the song just now, guys?

156
00:17:00,424 --> 00:17:01,824
Seru gak?
Was it fun?

157
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:02,924
Serulah!
Of course it was!

158
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:07,824
Jadi, tadi Risu sudah menyanyikan lagu dengan judul "Batsubyo" dan juga "Summertime".
So, Risu has just sung the songs titled "Setting Sail" and "Summertime".

159
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:11,224
Kalian pasti udah pernah denger lagu "Summertime" kan?
You've definitely heard the song "Summertime" before, right?

160
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:15,024
Yap, pasti udah pernahlah ya. Hehe.
Yep, I'm sure you have. Hehe.

161
00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:22,524
Dua lagu barusan tuh, kalau kata Risu sih, cocok banget dengan tempat yang kita kunjungi sekarang, guys.
Those two songs, in Risu's opinion, really suit the place we're visiting now, guys.

162
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:30,024
Kan kalau di pantai kayak gini nih, lagunya kan juga harus yang bersemangat, terus juga fresh gitu nggak sih?
When you're at a beach like this, the songs should be energetic and fresh, shouldn't they?

163
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:36,124
Terus guys, gimana tadi penampilan truknya Risu?
And guys, how was Risu's truck performance?

164
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:40,424
Selain bisa dipakai buat bepergian, truknya juga bisa berubah jadi panggung gitu, guys.
Besides being used for travel, the truck can also transform into a stage, guys.

165
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:45,024
Wow, keren banget nggak sih kalau kata Risu sih ya, keren banget, guys.
Wow, isn't it super cool? In Risu's opinion, it's super cool, guys.

166
00:17:49,724 --> 00:17:51,624
Oh, spoiler dikit ya.
Oh, a little spoiler.

167
00:17:51,624 --> 00:17:55,024
Truknya nanti nggak cuma bisa satu mode lho, guys.
The truck will have more than one mode, guys.

168
00:17:55,024 --> 00:18:00,024
Jadi jangan pergi dulu dan tonton acaranya sampai habis ya!
So don't go anywhere and watch the show until the end, okay!

169
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:02,524
Eits, jangan lupa buat screenshot yang banyak...
Hey, don't forget to take lots of screenshots...

170
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:07,824
...dan post di sosial media dengan hashtag di atas.
...and post them on social media with the hashtag above.

171
00:18:07,824 --> 00:18:12,024
Kalau nggak, nanti truknya nggak lanjut jalan lho.
If you don't, the truck won't keep going.

172
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,524
Hmm hmm hmm.

173
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:19,024
Wih, udah pada banyak aja nih yang nge-post.
Whoa, there are already a lot of people posting.

174
00:18:19,024 --> 00:18:22,524
Ya udah kalau gitu, kita let's go ke tempat selanjutnya.
Alright then, let's head to the next location.

175
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:26,524
Telolet telolet telolet telolet telolet!

176
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:52,024
Weight of the World / English Version

177
00:19:13,824 --> 00:19:17,424
I feel like I'm losing hope

178
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:20,624
In my body and my soul

179
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:24,024
And the sky, it looks so ominous

180
00:19:27,224 --> 00:19:30,324
And as time comes to a halt

181
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:33,624
Silence starts to overflow

182
00:19:33,624 --> 00:19:38,524
My cries are inconspicuous

183
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:42,524
Tell me, God, are You punishing me?

184
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:46,524
Is this the price I'm paying for my past mistakes?

185
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,524
This is my redemption song

186
00:19:58,324 --> 00:19:59,024
I need you more...

187
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,348
I need you more than ever right now

188
00:20:04,632 --> 00:20:07,632
Can you hear me now?

189
00:20:08,532 --> 00:20:11,165
'Cause we're gonna shout it loud

190
00:20:11,165 --> 00:20:14,232
Even if our words seem meaningless

191
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:19,365
It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world

192
00:20:20,565 --> 00:20:23,932
I wish that some way, somehow

193
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:27,298
That I can save every one of us

194
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:32,098
But the truth is that I'm only one girl

195
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:41,398
Maybe if I keep believing, my dreams will come to life

196
00:20:43,332 --> 00:20:46,898
Come to life...

197
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:03,032
After all the laughter fades

198
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:06,165
Signs of life all washed away

199
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:12,798
I can still, still feel a gentle breeze

200
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:16,665
No matter how hard I pray

201
00:21:16,665 --> 00:21:19,898
Signs of warning still remain

202
00:21:19,898 --> 00:21:25,598
And life has become my enemy

203
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:31,932
Tell me God, are you punishing me?

204
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:38,232
Is this the price I'm paying for my past mistakes?

205
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:45,065
This is my redemption song

206
00:21:45,532 --> 00:21:50,398
I need you more than ever right now

207
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:54,665
Can you hear me now?

208
00:21:55,498 --> 00:21:58,232
'Cause we're gonna shout it loud

209
00:21:58,232 --> 00:22:01,332
Even if our words seem meaningless

210
00:22:01,332 --> 00:22:06,698
It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world

211
00:22:07,832 --> 00:22:11,132
I wish that some way, somehow

212
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:14,398
That I can save every one of us

213
00:22:14,398 --> 00:22:19,332
But the truth is that I'm only one girl

214
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:05,898
'Cause we're gonna shout it loud

215
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:08,998
Even if our words seem meaningless

216
00:23:08,998 --> 00:23:14,198
It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world

217
00:23:16,532 --> 00:23:19,732
I wish that some way, somehow

218
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,998
That I can save every one of us

219
00:23:22,998 --> 00:23:27,798
But the truth is that I'm only one girl

220
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:32,098
Still we're gonna shout it loud

221
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:35,132
Even if our words seem meaningless

222
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:40,398
It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world

223
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:45,398
I hope that some way, somehow

224
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:48,565
That I can save every one of us

225
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:53,332
But the truth is that I'm only one girl

226
00:23:54,932 --> 00:24:02,198
Maybe if I keep believing, my dreams will come to life

227
00:24:05,732 --> 00:24:09,198
Come to life...

228
00:24:34,532 --> 00:24:40,032

Departures ~A Song of Love for You~
Lyrics, Music: ryo

249
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:47,340
もうあなたから愛されることも
Being loved by you no longer...

250
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:54,040
必要とされることもない
...nor being needed by you exists anymore.

251
00:27:54,540 --> 00:28:03,040
そして私はこうして一人ぼっちで
And so, I am here all alone like this.

252
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,540
あの時あなたは何て言ったの?
What did you say back then?

253
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:17,340
届かない言葉は宙を舞う
The words that cannot reach dance in the air.

254
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:24,440
わかってるのに今日もしてしまう
Even though I know, I do it again today.

255
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:31,040
叶わぬ願いごとを
Making a wish that won't come true.

256
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:40,240
離さないで ぎゅっと 手を握ってて
Don't let go, hold my hand tightly.

257
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:47,240
あなたと二人 続くと言って
Tell me that the two of us will continue.

258
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:55,240
繋いだその手は温かくて
The hand I held was so warm...

259
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,540
優しかった
...it was so kind.

260
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,540
あなたはいつもそうやって私を
You always do that to me...

261
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:27,540
怒らせて最後には泣かすんだ
...making me angry and making me cry in the end.

262
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:34,040
だけど後になって「ごめんね」と言う
But then later you would say "I'm sorry".

263
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:40,540
その顔 好きだった
I loved that face of yours.

264
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,040
離さないで ぎゅっと 思い切り
Don't let go, hold me tight with all your might.

265
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,140
あなたの腕の中にいたい
I want to be in your arms.

266
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,040
二人で...
Together we...

267
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:05,948
...おでこを合わせながら
...while touching our foreheads together.

268
00:30:09,864 --> 00:30:11,579
ねえ、
Hey,

269
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:13,799
ありがとう
thank you.

270
00:30:14,216 --> 00:30:19,012
会えないってこと、知ってたの
I knew that we couldn't meet.

271
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,505
離さないで
Don't let go.

272
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:50,466
ぎゅっと、あなたが好き
Hold me tight, I love you.

273
00:30:51,154 --> 00:30:57,472
もう一度だって 笑ってくれないの
Won't you smile for me even just once more?

274
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:07,522
あなたの温もりが消えちゃう前に
Before your warmth fades away,

275
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:13,298
抱きしめたい
I want to hold you.

276
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:58,048
Telolet telolet telolet telolet!
Honk honk honk honk!

277
00:31:58,548 --> 00:31:59,848
Hehe!

278
00:32:00,248 --> 00:32:03,548
Siapa yang suka driving sambil lihat pemandangan...
Who likes driving while looking at the scenery...

279
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:07,548
...dan sing along sama lagu yang lagi diputar di musik player?
...and singing along to the song playing on the music player?

280
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:10,548
Aku aku aku aku!
Me, me, me, me!

281
00:32:11,248 --> 00:32:15,048
Barusan juga kalian kan udah dengar lagu-lagu yang menyentuh hati...
Just now, you also heard songs that touch the heart...

282
00:32:15,048 --> 00:32:18,548
...sambil ditemani pemandangan alami gitu.
...accompanied by a natural view like that.

283
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:20,348
Ya, nggak?
Right?

284
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:24,548
Lagu-lagu sebelumnya tuh lagu favorit Risu semua, Guys.
The previous songs were all Risu's favorites, guys.

285
00:32:25,048 --> 00:32:27,848
Pasti kalian udah pada tahu judulnya, kan ya?
I'm sure you already know the titles, right?

286
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:32,548
Wih, pasti kalian terharu banget sih dengernya tadi. Hehe.
Whoa, I'm sure you were really moved hearing them earlier. Hehe.

287
00:32:34,248 --> 00:32:37,848
Terus, setelah melewati pemandangan yang asri...
Then, after passing through the lush scenery...

288
00:32:37,848 --> 00:32:41,548
...kita masuk ke daerah perkotaan nih, Guys.
...we're entering the urban area, guys.

289
00:32:42,248 --> 00:32:46,548
Enak banget sih kayaknya nyetir di perkotaan sambil nyanyi-nyanyi gitu.
It feels really nice driving in the city while singing along like that.

290
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:50,348
Apalagi kalau lagunya yang syahdu gitu, Guys.
Especially if the song is serene like that, guys.

291
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:55,548
Ayo, lanjut nyanyi bareng Risu sambil lihat pemandangan kota.
Come on, let's continue singing with Risu while looking at the city view.

292
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,848
Ayo, Guys! Let's go!
Come on, guys! Let's go!

293
00:32:58,348 --> 00:33:01,348
Telolet telolet telolet telolet! Hehe.
Honk honk honk honk! Hehe.

294
00:33:12,848 --> 00:33:15,848
急に不機嫌な音 消えた
Suddenly, the sullen sound vanished.

295
00:33:16,148 --> 00:33:19,548
部屋に残った缶ビール
A beer can left in the room.

296
00:33:19,548 --> 00:33:24,348
押し殺した息が 喘いだ私に
My stifled breath gasped as I...

297
00:33:25,148 --> 00:33:27,548
見えた
...saw.

298
00:33:28,248 --> 00:33:30,848
めちゃくちゃになった部屋
A room in a total mess,

299
00:33:30,848 --> 00:33:33,848
死体みたいなぬいぐるみ
a stuffed toy like a corpse.

300
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:39,048
今夜はパレード
Tonight is a parade.

301
00:33:39,248 --> 00:33:42,548
弱めの冷房に揺れた前髪が
My bangs swayed in the weak air conditioning,

302
00:33:42,548 --> 00:33:45,048
あの夏を
making me remember

303
00:33:45,048 --> 00:33:50,348
何度も思い出させる
that summer over and over.

304
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:53,348
眠る街に行こう
Let's go to the sleeping city,

305
00:33:53,348 --> 00:33:55,848
眠る街に行こうよ
let's go to the sleeping city.

306
00:33:56,248 --> 00:34:00,348
今夜も街とは
Tonight, too, the city

307
00:34:00,348 --> 00:34:03,548
耐え切れずに目をつぶるんだ
can't take it anymore and closes its eyes.

308
00:34:13,248 --> 00:34:15,548
砕けて散った落とし物
Lost things shattered and scattered,

309
00:34:15,548 --> 00:34:18,048
ドラマで見たんだ
I saw it in a drama.

310
00:34:18,248 --> 00:34:21,048
正義は必ず勝つって
That justice always wins...

311
00:34:21,048 --> 00:34:23,548
正義って何なの
...but what is justice?

312
00:34:24,248 --> 00:34:27,248
わかんないことはわかんないよ
I don't understand what I don't understand,

313
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:30,348
まだ子供だし 大人じゃないし
I'm still a child, not an adult yet.

314
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:33,248
今日も天井を見ていた
Today, too, I was looking at the ceiling,

315
00:34:33,248 --> 00:34:35,848
変わらない風景だ
it's an unchanging scenery.

316
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:38,548

318
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:44,248
今夜向かいのビルも
Tonight, even the building opposite

319
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,848
布団に潜るんだ
crawls under its duvet.

320
00:35:09,556 --> 00:35:11,556
眠る街に夜行
Night travel through the sleeping city

321

もうすぐ終点だよ
It's almost the last stop.

323
00:35:19,556 --> 00:35:21,056
さよなら
Goodbye

324
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:25,056
なんてことない気がしたんだ
I felt like it was nothing special

325
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:29,556
あの日の私と変わらない私に
To the me who hasn't changed since that day

326
00:35:29,556 --> 00:35:31,056
もういいよ
It's enough already

327
00:35:32,056 --> 00:35:34,056
許してそれから
Forgive me, and then...

328
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:36,056
眠る街に夜行
Night travel through the sleeping city

329
00:35:36,556 --> 00:35:39,056
眠る街に夜行をーよ
Night travel through the sleeping city

330
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:40,556
もういいよ
It's enough already

331
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:42,556
疲れたよ
I'm tired

332
00:35:43,056 --> 00:35:46,056
じゃあまたね
Well then, see you later

333
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:51,056

Lyrics, Music: OSTER project

337
00:36:59,056 --> 00:37:05,556
ありふれた私というコンチェルトなぞれる日々
Days where I can trace the concerto of my mundane self

338
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:12,056
それとなくタクトに合わせれば保証されるハーモニー
Harmony is guaranteed if I casually follow the baton

339
00:37:12,556 --> 00:37:19,056
ダウンビート割とストイックでクラシカルな誘惑せいでーも
Even if the downbeat is somewhat stoic
and caused by classical temptation

340
00:37:19,556 --> 00:37:26,556
アップビートはアドリブで行かなきゃ退屈でしょ
The upbeat must be an ad-lib, otherwise it's boring, right?

341
00:37:26,556 --> 00:37:34,056
あぁスコア通りの日常に枯れゆくこの命ならば
Ah, if this life of mine is to wither away
in a routine following the score

342
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:42,056
いっそ背徳の渦に溺れてしまいたい
I'd rather drown in a whirlpool of immorality

343
00:37:42,556 --> 00:37:49,056
その指に光る愛の証さえ消えそうなほど優しく
So gently that even the proof of love
shining on that finger seems to fade

344
00:37:49,056 --> 00:37:57,056
ささやいた言葉は禁断のセレナーデ
The words whispered were a forbidden serenade

345
00:38:20,056 --> 00:38:26,556
24時瞳を閉じれば想うのはあなたのことばかり
At midnight, when I close my eyes,
I think only of you

346
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:33,056
そんなの良くないよなんて友達は言うけれど
Friends say that's not good, but...

347
00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:41,056
あぁそんな言葉じゃ私の乾きが潤うことなどない
Ah, words like that will never quench my thirst

348
00:38:41,056 --> 00:38:48,556
可愛げないセリフでプライドが乱れ出す
My pride begins to unravel with uncute lines

349
00:38:49,056 --> 00:38:56,556
散らばったスコアの上ひび割れた愛が溶け散るその前に
Before the cracked love melts and
scatters on the scattered scores

350
00:38:56,556 --> 00:39:03,556
キスで繋ぎ止めて回り始めたラプソディ
Hold it together with a kiss,
the rhapsody has begun to turn

351
00:39:30,056 --> 00:39:38,056
加速するアイドリズム突き詰めて確かめ合うように永久
Accelerating idolism, pushing it to the limit
to confirm each other forever

352
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:44,556
フォルテッシモでもう強く強く抱きしめて
Hold me tighter and tighter in fortissimo

353
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:52,056
重なり合うこの声は闇に溶けて消えてゆくから
Because these overlapping voices will
melt into the darkness and vanish

354
00:39:52,056 --> 00:40:00,056
きっと大丈夫よ何も悪いことじゃない
I'm sure it'll be okay, it's nothing bad

355

どうだった？
How was it?

358
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:47,364
言い換えれば灰色だったんだ
In other words, it was gray

359
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:52,564
夜から　帰らなきゃって言って
Saying I have to go home from the night

360
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:55,764
どれほどたちのさじを払った
How much fate did I pay for?

361
00:40:56,264 --> 00:40:58,264
退屈な原っぱ
In this boring field

362
00:40:59,064 --> 00:41:03,064
抜け出せるなら　明日は明日の花
If I can escape, tomorrow's flower is for tomorrow

363
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:07,564
痛いけど　同期はよりによって
It hurts, but of all things, the sync...

364
00:41:07,764 --> 00:41:10,564
と言われるがままだ
...is just as they say

365
00:41:11,164 --> 00:41:18,564
ビロードの目に映る都のネイビー
The city's navy reflected in velvet eyes

366
00:41:19,464 --> 00:41:23,264
頭上だ　トドの如く居座れたら
Above my head, if I could sit there like a sea lion

367
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:26,564
枯れるまで煽る
Stoking it until it withers

368
00:41:27,464 --> 00:41:30,864
パッと眼舞う　キリのない
Flashing before my eyes, endless

369
00:41:31,064 --> 00:41:34,564
眠らない　街びる
The city that doesn't sleep

370
00:41:34,764 --> 00:41:38,264
憧れに千切れるまで　Low
Until torn by longing, Low

371
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:40,564
行ったり来たりのパンチ
Back and forth punches

372
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,664
頭振りゆくジャンキー
A junkie shaking their head

373
00:41:42,764 --> 00:41:46,564
あんな間に散りゆく満点　灯
Perfect lights scattered in an instant

374
00:41:46,664 --> 00:41:48,564
踏んだり蹴ったりのダーリン
Misfortunes never come singly, darling

375
00:41:48,664 --> 00:41:51,564
その先は甘美
Beyond that is sweet

376
00:42:07,264 --> 00:42:09,164
巡り巡るメトロ
The spinning metro

377
00:42:09,264 --> 00:42:11,164
いちばんの夢見たこの迷路
This maze where I had the greatest dream

378
00:42:11,264 --> 00:42:13,164
この夜 Make it out
This night, Make it out

379
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,164
これは運命と
This is fate, I say

380
00:42:15,264 --> 00:42:17,064
解く解くよ
Explaining it, explaining it

381
00:42:17,164 --> 00:42:19,064
止まることのない通りは
The street that never stops

382
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:21,064
Walk walk walk around

383
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:24,064
寝れない夜明かそうよ
Let's stay up all night

384
00:42:24,164 --> 00:42:25,864
ステップ　タタタ
Step, ta-ta-ta

385
00:42:25,964 --> 00:42:28,164
踊れる　大人ら
Dancing adults

386
00:42:28,264 --> 00:42:31,564
重なる心臓　地団駄踏んでも
Overlapping hearts, even if I stamp my feet

387
00:42:31,664 --> 00:42:35,364
期待とか見栄とかわからない
I don't understand expectations or vanity

388
00:42:35,464 --> 00:42:37,564
ただ夢を見続けた
I just kept on dreaming

389
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:41,564
虹色グラフィティ
Rainbow-colored graffiti

390
00:42:42,164 --> 00:42:46,164
離れないよね　オングラビティ
You won't leave, will you? On gravity

391
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:51,064
このフラットな夜　変えるから
I'll change this flat night

392
00:42:56,164 --> 00:43:00,064
雑踏の渦のシルクハット
The top hat in the whirlpool of the crowd

393
00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:07,064
頭上だ　トドの如く居座れたら
