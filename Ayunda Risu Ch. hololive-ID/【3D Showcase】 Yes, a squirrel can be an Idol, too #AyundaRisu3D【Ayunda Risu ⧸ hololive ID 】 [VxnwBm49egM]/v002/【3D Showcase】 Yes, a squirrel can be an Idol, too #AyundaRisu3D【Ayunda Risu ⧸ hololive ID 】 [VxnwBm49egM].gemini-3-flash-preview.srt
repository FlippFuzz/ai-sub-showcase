KING

Lyrics・Composition: Kanaria

4
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,200
幽霊だ、行こう、唸る愛に
I'm a ghost, let's go, into the roaring love

5
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,900
幽霊だ、行こう、未熟なラリー
I'm a ghost, let's go, an immature rally

6
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,900
幽霊だ、ストップ、知ってないし
I'm a ghost, stop, I don't even know

7
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,100
勘弁にしてよ、怠慢なラリー
Give me a break, a negligent rally

8
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,500
人様願う欠片のアイロニー
The irony of a fragment that people wish for

9
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,500
だれもが願う無機質なような
Like the inorganic state that everyone wishes for

10
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,500
一掃し、先んじ、始めてタイニーな
Swept away, preempted, starting tiny

11
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,900
ハッとして、笑えない、ハジメテパッパッパ
Startled, can't laugh, first pappappa

12
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,900
パッパッパ
Pappappa

13
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,900
左様なら、おねがいひとつ
Farewell, I have one wish

14
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,000
愛も変わらず、おまけにウォーニンウォーニン
Love remains unchanged, plus warning, warning

15
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,000
左様なら、おねがいひとつ
Farewell, I have one wish

16
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,900
張り詰めた、思い込め
Filled with tension, pour your heart into it

17
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
レフトサイド、ライトサイド
Left side, right side

18
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,200
歯を剥き出して、パッパッパ
Baring your teeth, pappappa

19
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,900
照れくさいね
It's embarrassing

20
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,300
レフトサイド、ライトサイド
Left side, right side

21
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,900
歯を突き出して、パッパッパ
Baring your teeth, pappappa

22
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,900
You are King

23
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,500
You are King

24
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,300
無邪気に遊ぶ、期待期待のダーリンダーリン
Playing innocently, the darling of expectation

25
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,400
健気に笑う、痛い痛いの消える
Smiling bravely, the pain fades away

26
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,200
無様にしねる、苦い思いもなくなって
Dying ungracefully, the bitter thoughts are gone

27
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,200
ララ、バイバイバイ、期待期待の最前線
Lala, bye-bye-bye, the front line of expectation

28
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,400
左様なら、おねがいひとつ
Farewell, I have one wish

29
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,500
愛も変わらず、ピックアップのウォーニンウォーニン
Love remains unchanged, pickup warning, warning

30
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,700
左様なら、おねがいひとつ
Farewell, I have one wish

31
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,400
張り詰めた、思い込め
Filled with tension, pour your heart into it

32
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,200
レフトサイド、ライトサイド
Left side, right side

33
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,300
歯を剥き出して、パッパッパ
Baring your teeth, pappappa

34
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,100
邪魔くさいね
It's annoying

35
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,100
レフトサイド、ライトサイド
Left side, right side

36
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,500
歯を突き出して、パッパッパ
Baring your teeth, pappappa

37
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,200
You are King

38
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,300
You are King

39
00:05:00,033 --> 00:10:00,033
KING

Hello! Oh, I'm finally 3D guys! Yes!

63
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:57,466
The memer squirrel is finally in 3D! Amazing!

64
00:06:57,466 --> 00:07:01,866
But, but, this is only the beginning alright?

65
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:05,433
Because there will be more, because this is only the beginning.

66
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:11,033
So, えとね... Iya iya iya iya iya. Ho ho ho ho ho.
So, well... Yes yes yes yes yes. Ho ho ho ho ho.

67
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:17,099
Look at me! Look at me all you want before we actually moving, alright?

68
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:22,066
So after this we're going to check my bedroom. Yes, I think you've seen it...

69
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,633
...previously, just a glimpse of it right?

70
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:28,966
Jadi habis ini tuh Risu mau mengecek kamar ya. Oke? Oke?
So after this Risu wants to check the room. Okay? Okay?

Yes, are you ready? Oh my god, how cute! Ah, looks like a fluffy tail!

Rustle rustle rustle rustle... it looks like! Ayayayayaya... Okay.

So, you know what? Let's move on to a more comfortable place, to my bedroom, okay?

74
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,233
Let's a-go!

75
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:51,333
Ulululu... Gamba Risu!
Ulululu... Do your best, Risu!

76
00:10:06,645 --> 00:10:11,845
ハロー　窓を開けて　小さく呟いた
Hello, I opened the window and whispered softly

77
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:16,845
ハウアーユー　誰もいない　部屋で一人
How are you? Alone in a room with no one else

78
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:21,845
モーニング　朝が来たよ　どしゃ降りの朝が
Morning, the morning has come, a downpouring morning

79
00:10:22,145 --> 00:10:29,045
ティクタック　私のネジを　誰か巻いて
Tick-tock, someone please wind up my spring

80
00:10:30,545 --> 00:10:44,045
ハロ/ハワユ
Hello/How Are You

81
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:34,045
Lyrics & Composition: ナノウ
Lyrics & Composition: Nanou

82
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:54,045
ハロー　昔のアニメに　そんなのいたっけな
Hello, was there something like that in an old anime?

83
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:59,045
ハウアーユー　羨ましいな　皆に愛されて
How are you? I'm so jealous, being loved by everyone

84
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:05,045
スリーピー　馬鹿なこと言ってないで　支度をしなくちゃ
Sleepy, stop talking nonsense and get ready

85
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:09,545
クライ　涙の跡を隠すため
Cry, to hide the traces of my tears

86
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,045
もう口癖になった「まぁいっか」
The phrase "Oh well" has become a habit

87
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:15,545
昨日の言葉がふと頭をよぎる
Yesterday's words suddenly cross my mind

88
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:20,545
「もう君には全然期待してないから」
"I don't expect anything from you anymore"

89
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:25,545
そりゃまぁ私だって　自分に期待などしてないけれど
Well, I don't really expect anything from myself either, but...

90
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:30,045
あれは一体どういうつもりですか
What on earth did you mean by that?

91
00:11:30,545 --> 00:11:33,045
喉元まで出かかった言葉
The words that were about to come out of my throat

92
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:35,045
口を突いて出たのは嘘
But what came out of my mouth was a lie

93
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:38,045
こうして今日も私は貴重な
And so today, I continue to use

94
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:40,045
言葉を使い分けて生きてゆく
These precious words differently as I live on

95
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:43,045
なぜ隠してしまうのですか
Why do you hide it?

96
00:11:43,145 --> 00:11:45,045
笑われるのが怖いのですか
Are you afraid of being laughed at?

97
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:48,045
誰にも会いたくないのですか
Do you not want to see anyone?

98
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:50,045
それ本当ですか
Is that really true?

99
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:53,045
曖昧という名の海に溺れて
Drowning in a sea called ambiguity

100
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,045
息も出来ないほど苦しいの
It's so painful I can't even breathe

101
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:58,045
少し声が聞きたくなりました
I wanted to hear your voice a little bit

102
00:11:58,145 --> 00:12:00,045
本当に弱いな
I'm really weak

103
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:18,045
一向に進まない支度の途中
In the middle of getting ready, which isn't progressing

104
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:20,545
朦朧とした頭で思う
I think with a hazy head

105
00:12:21,045 --> 00:12:26,045
「もう理由を付けて休んでしまおうかな」
"Maybe I'll just make up an excuse and take the day off"

106
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,545
いやいや分かってますって
No, no, I know

107
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:30,545
なんとなく言ってみただけだよ
I just said it for no reason

108
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:35,545
分かってるから怒らないでよ
I know, so please don't be mad

109
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:38,545
幸せだろうと不幸せだろうと
Whether I'm happy or unhappy

110
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:40,545
平等に残酷に朝は来る
The morning comes equally and cruelly

111
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:45,545
生きていくだけで精一杯の私に
To me, who's doing my best just to keep living

112
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:50,045
これ以上何を望むというの
What more do you want from me?

113
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:58,545
なぜ気にしてしまうのですか
Why do you care?

114
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,045
本当は愛されたいのですか
Do you actually want to be loved?

115
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:04,045
その手を離したのは誰ですか
Who was the one who let go of that hand?

116
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:06,045
気が付いてますか
Do you realize it?

117
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:09,045
人生にタイムカードがあるなら
If there were a time card for life

118
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:11,045
終わりの時間はいつなんだろう
I wonder when the clock-out time would be

119
00:13:11,545 --> 00:13:14,045
私が生きた分の給料は
To whom should the salary

120
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:16,545
誰に払うのですか
For the time I've lived be paid?

121
00:13:26,045 --> 00:13:28,545
サンキュー
Thank you

122
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:31,045
ありがとうと言いたいよ
I want to say thank you

123
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:34,045
サンキュー
Thank you

124
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:36,045
ありがとうと言いたいよ
I want to say thank you

125
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:39,045
サンキュー
Thank you

126
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:41,045
一度だけでもいいから
Even just once is enough

127
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:44,045
心の底から大泣きしながら
While crying from the bottom of my heart

128
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:46,545
ありがとうと言いたいよ
I want to say thank you

129
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:51,545
なぜ隠してしまうのですか
Why do you hide it?

130
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:54,045
本当は聞いて欲しいのですか
Do you actually want someone to listen?

131
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:57,045
絶対に笑ったりしないから
I definitely won't laugh

132
00:13:57,145 --> 00:13:59,045
話してみませんか
So won't you try talking to me?

133
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:02,045
口を開かなければ分からない
If you don't open your mouth, I won't know

134
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:04,045
思ってるだけでは伝わらない
Just thinking it won't get through

135
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,045
なんて面倒くさい生き物でしょう
What a troublesome creature

136
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:10,045
人間というのは
Humans are

137
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:13,045
ハロー
Hello

138
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,045

あなたに　ハロー　ハウアーユー
To you, hello, how are you

144
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:47,045

146
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:51,045
Oh my God! Woo!

147
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:56,045
Ini ya guys ya, ada...
So, guys, there is...

148
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,045
...ada satu di mana... orang-orang tuh masih kaget gitu.
...there's one thing where... people are still shocked like that.

149
00:15:00,657 --> 00:15:02,557
Ada kemarin Risu nyanyi "Hello, How Are You"
Risu sang "Hello, How Are You" yesterday,

150
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:04,257
pas debut dan masih dishare sampe sekarang.
during my debut, and it's still shared now.

151
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:09,177
So people have actually just discovered...

152
00:15:09,177 --> 00:15:13,257
recently discovered my, what is it... debut video...

153
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:18,257
...where Ayunda actually showed up singing "Hello, How Are You".

154
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:22,557
So for me, for me personally though, it's... it's such a...

155
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:27,557
...life-changing experience. Yeah...

156
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:32,457
Wow, I'm starting to... to sound old right now, yeah.

157
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:37,457
It's just that, without that, without that first experience,

158
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:41,257
I wouldn't be here right now...

159
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:43,857
...and you wouldn't know Ayunda or even Risu.

160
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:48,557
And why I chose that song, it's because it has like a...

161
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:52,557
what is it again... personal attachment, I guess.

162
00:15:53,257 --> 00:15:57,857
So the OG... the OG would know, alright? Yes, right?

163
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:03,057
So, when I was singing the song, I... I really...

164
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:05,857
what is it again... I really tried to hold myself

165
00:16:05,857 --> 00:16:10,057
to not become so teary-teary.

166
00:16:10,557 --> 00:16:13,057
And also, I would like to introduce you to my room!

167
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:17,557

00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:23,057

00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:51,581
Jadi, jadi ya temen-temen, kemarin, kemarin itu kan Risu kan abis dari tempatnya Moona ya.
So, so friends, yesterday,
Risu went to Moona's place.

316
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:58,581
Ah, jadi tuh... Risu tuh dapet oleh-oleh yang mana Risu ambil sendiri sih oleh-olehnya ya.
Ah, so... Risu got a souvenir,
which Risu actually took herself.

317
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:05,581
Jadi karena... sekarang tuh kebetulan lagi streaming 3D ya, jadi...
So because... since this happens to be a 3D stream, so...

318
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:11,081
Kayaknya tuh... kayaknya tuh seru gitu kalau Risu hitung ya apa sih isi celengannya gitu. Oke? Oke?
I think... it'd be fun if Risu counts
what's inside the piggy bank. Okay? Okay?

319
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:17,581
Ada berapa banyak ya kira-kira? Mari kita hitung temen-temen.
How many are there approximately?
Let's count, friends.

320
00:26:18,581 --> 00:26:19,881

321
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,581

00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:35,081
Moona, Iofi! Open up!

325
00:26:35,281 --> 00:26:36,881
Risu-nya lagi nggak ada!
Risu's not here right now!

326
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:38,881
RISU!

327
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:40,281

328
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:41,881
MOONA!

329
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:47,081
Ini ada yang maling di sebelah aku kayaknya.
It seems like there's a thief next to me.

330
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:49,081
Sabar, sabar, Risu buka dulu ntar dulu.
Wait, wait, let Risu open up first.

331
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,081
AAA! TOLONG! TOLONG!

Nggak boleh! Sini! Sini!
You can't! Come here! Come here!

Ah... alright... I said I wasn't in my room.

335
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:11,081
Ternyata ini!
It turns out it's this!

336
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:13,581
Kamu sih aku kan jadi dilabrak sama Moona tahu nggak?
Because of you, Moona confronted me, you know?

337
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:17,581
Ih... susah-susah maret tahu nggak? Susah-susah maret!
I worked hard saving that, you know? Worked hard!

338
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:20,081
Kapan kamu ambil celengannya?
When did you take the piggy bank?

339
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:22,081
Kemarin pas bawa...
Yesterday when bringing...

340
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:24,581
Parah! Parah!
Terrible! Terrible!

341
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:26,581
Ini isinya ada berapa? Isinya ada berapa?
How much is inside? How much is inside?

342
00:27:26,681 --> 00:27:29,081
Tadi baru tiga doang sih, tapi masih banyak. Jangan bilang-bilang.
It was only three just now, but there's
still a lot. Don't tell anyone.

343
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:32,081
Oh gitu ya! Moona lagi bokek!
Oh is that so! Moona is broke right now!

344
00:27:33,581 --> 00:27:35,081
Nih mau ambil? Ambil nggak?
Here, want to take it? Are you taking it?

345
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,081
Aku nggak tahu apa-apa!
I don't know anything!

346
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:42,581
Nggak tahu apa-apa!
I don't know anything!

347
00:27:42,581 --> 00:27:44,581
Aku nggak ikut-ikutan!
I'm not involved!

348
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:45,581

Okay, okay, sorry, later, Risu... okay,

Risu will buy a better one. Okay? A new one.
Yes, a better, bigger one, yes!

351
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:01,081
Bener?

00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:02,581

Aman guys, aman, aman.

00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:13,581
Aduh... harus disogok dulu guys.
Man... have to bribe her first, guys.

357
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:16,581
Nggak apa-apalah, happy. Sering-sering aja kalau kita nggak bokek.
It's okay, as long as we're happy. Do it
often as long as we're not broke.

358
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:18,581
Bokek nanti Risu-nya.
Then Risu will be the broke one.

359
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,081
Nggak apa-apa. Kebetulan ya karena kan udah seneng nih, udah seneng ya.
It's fine. Since we're happy now,
we're happy.

360
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:29,081
Oke, jadi kebetulan kita bertiga, bagaimana kalau kita menyanyikan... Mars kita bertiga?
Okay, since the three of us are here, how

Kau kira ku tak menyadari.
You thought I didn't realize.

00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,581
Sesungguhnya ku tahu tapi kuikuti mau.
Actually I knew, but I went along with it.

Kita kita semua selamanya bersama kian hari semakin sayang.
All of us, together forever,
loving each other more every day.

374
00:29:21,081 --> 00:29:24,081
Saat air mata jatuh sekejap lagi.
When tears fall in a moment.

375
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:27,081
Kau genggam tanganku saling memandang.
You hold my hand, looking at each other.

00:33:23,893 --> 00:33:27,593
Aduh anjay, serem-serem banget guys.
Oh man, that was really scary, guys.

467
00:33:27,893 --> 00:33:32,093
Nah kalau begitu teman-teman, karena sudah ada Iofi sama Moona...
Now, in that case, friends, since Iofi and Moona were here...

468
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,593
...saatnya kita touch the grass.
...it's time for us to touch the grass.

469
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:38,093
Okay, we're going outside. We're gonna touch the grass for a while...

470
00:33:38,093 --> 00:33:42,593
...because stuck in the room always is not really good, alright?
...because staying stuck in the room all the time is not really good, alright?

471
00:33:42,893 --> 00:33:46,593
So, mari kita jalan-jalan keluar! Ikuyo!
So, let's go for a walk outside! Let's go!

472
00:33:58,593 --> 00:34:02,093

474
00:34:05,593 --> 00:34:08,593
Akhirnya guys, kita keluar.
Finally, guys, we're outside.

475
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:12,593
Jadi tuh, ada tujuannya kenapa Risu mau keluar.
So, there's a reason why Risu wanted to come out.

476
00:34:12,893 --> 00:34:16,893
Jadi Risu tuh mau ngeliatin ya, kira-kira tuh hutan ajaib Risu tuh seperti apa.
So, Risu wants to show you what Risu's magical forest looks like.

477
00:34:16,893 --> 00:34:20,093
Ini tuh kira-kira penampilannya ya mirip-mirip kayak ginilah gitu.
Its appearance is something like this.

478
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:24,093
So my magical forest looks kind of like this.

479
00:34:24,093 --> 00:34:26,393
I just want to show you the beautiful scenery.

480
00:34:26,593 --> 00:34:30,093
Yes, 私のマジカルフォレストはね...
Yes, my magical forest...

481
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:32,393
...とっても綺麗なんだけど...
...is very beautiful, but...

482
00:34:32,393 --> 00:34:35,593
...あの、怖いところもあったよ。
...well, there were scary parts too.

483
00:34:39,093 --> 00:34:41,393
あれ？ あれ？
Huh? Huh?

484
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:46,593
どうしたのかな、こんなところに迷子の小リスさんかな？
What's wrong, I wonder? A lost little squirrel in a place like this?

485
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:48,593
あれ？ リスザウルス。
Huh? Risusaurus.

486
00:34:48,593 --> 00:34:50,093
あれ？ リスザウルス。
Huh? Risusaurus.

487
00:34:50,093 --> 00:34:52,393
いや、私リスザウルスだよ。 え、本当？
No, I'm Risusaurus. Eh, really?

488
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:53,393
可愛い。
Cute.

489
00:34:53,393 --> 00:34:56,593
私リスザウルス、みんな...
I'm Risusaurus, everyone...

490
00:34:56,593 --> 00:35:00,093
可愛いけど怪しい。なんで？！
Cute but suspicious. Why?!

491
00:35:00,335 --> 00:35:01,490
どうしたの？
What's wrong?

492
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:05,525
リスちゃんが3Dだって聞いたから、今日は来たの。
I heard Risu-chan is 3D, so I came today.

493
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,555
え、来たんだ！
Oh, you came!

494
00:35:07,555 --> 00:35:09,235
あれ、リスザウルス、ありがとう。
Wait, Risusaurus, thank you.

495
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:13,305
けど、これはリスザウルスじゃないな、じゃないみたいだね。
But, this isn't Risusaurus, it doesn't look like it.

496
00:35:13,305 --> 00:35:14,455
リスザウルスだよ。
It is Risusaurus.

497
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:18,525
あれ？ いや、この声はね、この声はね、もしかして、もしかして...
Huh? No, this voice... this voice... could it be, could it be...

498
00:35:18,525 --> 00:35:19,555
オウガさんですか？
Oga-san?

499
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:20,105
え？

595
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:08,617
はらぱん ぱんぱんぱん...
Hara-pan pan-pan-pan...

596
00:40:11,917 --> 00:40:14,117
はぁー、はらぱん はらぱん したね。
Phew, that was quite a "Hara-pan" dance.

597
00:40:14,317 --> 00:40:16,517
はらぱん 凄かったよね。
The "Hara-pan" was amazing, wasn't it?

598
00:40:16,717 --> 00:40:17,617
楽しかったね。
It was fun.

599
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:20,117
楽しかった、いやー。
It was fun, indeed.

600
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:26,617
あのね、私の3D配信に来てくれてありがとう。
You know, thank you so much for coming to my 3D showcase.

601
00:40:27,117 --> 00:40:28,617
すごく楽しかった。
It was a lot of fun.

602
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:35,617
今から、本当にありがとうございました、本当に。
I'm truly grateful for everything, really.

603
00:40:36,117 --> 00:40:39,617
でもね、やっとね、3Dなれて。
But you know, you're finally in 3D.

604
00:40:39,817 --> 00:40:42,617
こうやってお披露目できて。
And being able to have this showcase.

605
00:40:43,117 --> 00:40:45,617
本当に良かったなと思います。
I think it's truly wonderful.

606
00:40:45,817 --> 00:40:47,617
ありがとうございました。
Thank you very much.

607
00:40:48,617 --> 00:40:52,617
じゃあ、おがしゃんと今日は、あとね、3分ぐらい喋れって言われた今。
Well, today with Oga-shan... Wait, I was just told we have about 3 more minutes to talk.

608
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,617
また遊ぶ、これあげる。
Let's play again. Here, have this.

609
00:40:55,117 --> 00:40:58,617
いや、まだね、もうちょっと喋れるんだって、どうする？
No, apparently we can still talk for a bit longer. What should we do?

610
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:01,117
もらっちゃったけど、ポーズ？ポーズ取る？
I received it, but... a pose? Should we strike a pose?

611
00:41:03,117 --> 00:41:05,617
はぁー！すごい！
Waaah! Amazing!

612
00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:08,617
待って待って。
Wait, wait.

613
00:41:09,617 --> 00:41:11,617
どうする？どんなポーズ取る？
What now? What kind of pose should we do?

614
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:14,117
可愛いよね。
It's cute, isn't it?

615
00:41:14,317 --> 00:41:15,617
私も可愛いよ。
I'm cute too!

616
00:41:16,117 --> 00:41:17,617
そうだね、リスちゃんも可愛いね。
That's true, you're cute too, Risu-chan.

617
00:41:18,617 --> 00:41:21,117
ほら、お尻こんな感じ。
Look, the butt looks like this.

618
00:41:21,317 --> 00:41:23,117
お尻、お尻、お尻。
Butt, butt, butt.

619
00:41:24,117 --> 00:41:27,617
リスちゃんも尻尾ふわふわでいいね。
Your tail is so fluffy and nice too, Risu-chan.

620
00:41:28,117 --> 00:41:29,617
おがしゃん尻尾欲しい。
Oga-shan, you want a tail?

621
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:33,617
尻尾ね、ちょっと欲しいか、つくかなこれ？
A tail... I guess I want one. I wonder if it'll attach?

622
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,617
可愛い。
Cute.

623
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:41,617
可愛いこれ。リスちゃん嫌がってないこれ？大好き？
This is cute. Risu-chan, you don't hate this, do you? Are you okay?

624
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:45,117
なんか、なんだよ！
Like, what the heck!

625
00:41:48,117 --> 00:41:50,617
あー、そうか、リスちゃん小さいね。
Ah, I see, you're really small, Risu-chan.

626
00:41:51,617 --> 00:41:53,117
私ほんとに小さいね。
I'm really small, aren't I?

627
00:41:54,117 --> 00:41:56,617
おがしゃんは本当に高いんですけど。
But you're really tall, Oga-shan.

628
00:41:58,117 --> 00:41:59,617
ほら、ホロスターズ一でかいからな。
Well, I am the biggest in Holostars, after all.

629
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:03,117
どれぐらい高いんですか？
How tall are you?

630
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:09,117
えーとね、192センチから200メートルまで大きくなります。
Well, I'm 192cm, but I can grow up to 200 meters.

631
00:42:10,117 --> 00:42:11,617
あれ、怖いじゃん。
Wait, that's scary.

632
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:14,617
ビルよりでかくなれるから。
Because I can become taller than a building.

633
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:16,617
おがビル。
Oga-Building.

634
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:25,617
でもなんか不思議な感じするな、リスちゃんとこうやって3Dで並んでると。
But it feels strange, standing next to you like this in 3D.

635
00:42:27,117 --> 00:42:32,617
あのね、3Dもらったら、映画、映画作る。
You know, now that I have 3D, I'm going to make a movie.

636
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,617
映画？ムービー作る？
A movie? You're making a film?

637
00:42:35,117 --> 00:42:37,117
あの、ワールド・ドミネーション・ムービー？
That "World Domination Movie"?

638
00:42:37,317 --> 00:42:38,617
そうそう。
Yes, yes.

639
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:41,617
いいね、是非とも一緒に撮ろう。
Nice. Let's definitely film it together.

640
00:42:42,617 --> 00:42:46,117
おがは、えっと何だろう、魔神、なんか。
Oga is... let's see, a demon or something.

641
00:42:48,117 --> 00:42:51,617
何だろう、でかいものって何だっけ？名前？
What's that giant thing called? The name?

642
00:42:52,617 --> 00:42:54,117
何だろう、巨人？
What could it be? A giant?

643
00:42:54,317 --> 00:42:56,617
巨人。魔神の巨人になる。
A giant. You'll be the Demon Giant.

644
00:42:57,117 --> 00:43:02,617
そして街にぶわぁーって。
And then go "Bwah!" through the city.

645
00:43:04,117 --> 00:43:07,617
わかりました。じゃあ、一緒に今度ムービー撮りましょう。
Understood. Let's film a movie together next time.

646
00:43:08,617 --> 00:43:11,617
これ可愛い。私なんか一回ぬいぐるみ欲しい。
This is cute. I want one of these plushies for myself.

647
00:43:12,617 --> 00:43:14,617
でもね、それもう家帰りたいって言ってるから。
But you know, this one says it already wants to go home.

648
00:43:15,617 --> 00:43:17,617
あ、これあげる。
Ah, here, have this.

649
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:21,617
じゃあ、こちらの二つは見てる皆さんにプレゼントするかもしれません。
Then, these two might be given away as presents to the viewers.

650
00:43:22,617 --> 00:43:25,617
というわけで、今日楽しかった。ありがとね。
Anyway, it was fun today. Thanks.

651
00:43:26,617 --> 00:43:29,617
またね、バイバイ！
See you later, bye-bye!

652
00:43:30,117 --> 00:43:31,617
バイバイね。
Bye-bye!

653
00:43:32,617 --> 00:43:34,617
楽しかった。
That was fun.

654
00:43:35,617 --> 00:43:38,117
That was... that was really crazy.

655
00:43:38,317 --> 00:43:41,617
That was really fun, it's...

656
00:43:42,117 --> 00:43:45,617
I can't really imagine that it's actually happening right now.

657
00:43:46,117 --> 00:43:48,117
凄い。はらぱんぱんぱん。
Amazing. Hara-pan-pan-pan.

658
00:43:49,117 --> 00:43:53,617
And then we're going to look at the scenery a little bit more.

659
00:43:54,117 --> 00:43:57,617
I'm sorry because there was an evil being before.

660
00:43:58,117 --> 00:44:00,617
There's a lot of flowers and the...

661
00:44:01,117 --> 00:44:03,117
the look is pretty aesthetic.

662
00:44:04,117 --> 00:44:06,617
And yeah, there's a lot of pretty flowers.

663
00:44:07,117 --> 00:44:08,617
綺麗ですね。
It's beautiful, isn't it?

Lyrics / Composition: R Sound Design

673
00:44:38,617 --> 00:44:41,117
拝啓僕の願った未来よ
Dear future that I wished for

674
00:44:41,617 --> 00:44:45,617
絶え間ない後悔よ
Relentless regret

675
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:50,117
体感八度五分の夢は
The dream of a 38.5 degree fever

676
00:44:50,617 --> 00:44:54,617
やがて散ってしまった
Has eventually scattered away

677
00:45:00,129 --> 00:45:03,129
Daphne, Vitis, Salvia...

678
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:05,929
Cyanus, Lychnis, Abelia...

679
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:08,629

Lychnis

681
00:45:10,929 --> 00:45:14,729
再会　君の想いは　憂は　巡る感情論は
Reunion. Your thoughts, your grief,
the revolving emotional arguments...

682
00:45:19,029 --> 00:45:23,029
半径85センチの
Within this 85-centimeter radius

683
00:45:23,029 --> 00:45:26,829
世界に　囚われたまま
remaining trapped in this world.

684
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:31,129
本音を挿し　微笑（わら）い合った今日
Stabbing our true feelings,
smiling at each other today,

685
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:34,729
溢れた色彩に
amidst the overflowing colors.

686
00:45:35,429 --> 00:45:39,129
薪（まき）をくべて風に乗せて
Stoking the fire, letting it ride the wind,

687
00:45:39,129 --> 00:45:42,629
錆びた空を彩る
coloring the rusted sky.

688
00:45:43,329 --> 00:45:47,429
濁った日々を丁寧に
Carefully tending to these muddy days,

689
00:45:47,429 --> 00:45:51,229
飾った花はすぐに枯れていく
the flowers I used to decorate them
soon wither away.

690
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:56,029
不遇な僕は夢から醒めて
Unlucky as I am, I wake from the dream,

691
00:45:56,029 --> 00:45:59,729
縋（すが）った意味も無い、ない、ない、ない
and there was no meaning in clinging to it,
none at all.

692
00:46:16,129 --> 00:46:20,129
君が僕にくれた声も　色も
The voice you gave me, the colors,

693
00:46:20,129 --> 00:46:23,629
揺るぎない愛情も
and your unwavering affection,

694
00:46:24,229 --> 00:46:28,229
二人きりの空に向かった星も
even the stars we watched in our private sky,

695
00:46:28,229 --> 00:46:31,829
とうに散ってしまった
have long since scattered.

696
00:46:32,529 --> 00:46:36,629
何時の末（すえ）も　温もりの冷えに
At the end of time, in the cooling of warmth,

697
00:46:36,629 --> 00:46:39,829
季節は色褪せて
the seasons fade.

698
00:46:40,529 --> 00:46:44,329
熱を帯びて身を震わせて
Gaining heat, body trembling,

699
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:47,929
擦れた街に零れる
spilling out into the worn-out streets.

700
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:52,729
荒（すさ）んだ日々を丁寧に
Carefully following these bleak days,

701
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:56,429
辿った先に花が咲くはず
flowers should bloom at the end of the path.

702
00:46:57,229 --> 00:47:01,429
不遇な君は夢を見たまま
Unlucky as you are, still dreaming,

703
00:47:01,429 --> 00:47:05,229
悟った振りで水を注いだ
you poured water while pretending to understand.

704
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:25,329
木漏れ日の中に　柔らかく咲いた
Blooming softly in the sunlight
filtering through trees,

705
00:47:25,329 --> 00:47:29,029
花は雲の上で
the flowers are above the clouds,

706
00:47:29,729 --> 00:47:33,829
散った星で夢の先で
at the scattered stars, beyond the dream,

707
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:37,429
揺れてる
they are swaying.

708
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:42,229
濁った日々を丁寧に
Carefully tending to these muddy days,

709
00:47:42,229 --> 00:47:46,029
飾った花はすぐに枯れていく
the flowers I used to decorate them
soon wither away.

710
00:47:46,629 --> 00:47:50,729
不遇な僕は夢から醒めて
Unlucky as I am, I wake from the dream,

711
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:54,529
縋った意味も無い、ない、ない、ない
and there was no meaning in clinging to it,
none at all.

712
00:47:55,329 --> 00:47:59,529
不毛な日々を丁寧に
Carefully on those barren days,

713
00:47:59,529 --> 00:48:03,129
綴った紙に花を描いた
I drew flowers on the paper I wrote on.

714
00:48:03,729 --> 00:48:07,829
不遇な僕ら夢に当てられて
Unlucky as we are, struck by the dream,

715
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:11,829
誓った筈も無かった事にしたい
I want to pretend that our oaths
never happened.

716
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:15,029
Daphne, Vitis, Iris, Maackia...

727
00:48:58,829 --> 00:49:02,429
Ayunda, can you say hi? Hi!

728
00:49:02,429 --> 00:49:06,129
(Laughs) Yes, Ayunda came too, you know?

729
00:49:06,129 --> 00:49:08,629

flos was my comfort song. And there's a lot of Ayunda in there...

732
00:49:21,629 --> 00:49:26,129
Because the original cover of my flos is full Risu, right?

733
00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:30,129
So I'm giving you more Ayunda. So so so.

Yes, I want to show you my mic.

00:49:41,329 --> 00:49:45,129
This is the mic that I personally designed since my debut.

738
00:49:46,129 --> 00:49:48,629
So this is the "Nut Mic". (Laughs)

739
00:49:49,129 --> 00:49:52,129

So before the last song, there's something Risu wants to say. Yes.

786
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:34,641
The time I set myself here

787
00:53:35,141 --> 00:53:39,141
I've decided to do my best.

788
00:53:39,941 --> 00:53:43,141
All the stories, moments,

789
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:45,441
and memories we shared

790
00:53:45,441 --> 00:53:49,141
are what's precious to me

791
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:54,141
The supports I've received

792
00:53:54,141 --> 00:53:57,741
are what keeps me going

793
00:53:57,741 --> 00:54:02,141
and made me who I am today

794
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:07,141
I can only convey my feelings

795
00:54:07,141 --> 00:54:09,641
through limited words

796
00:54:10,341 --> 00:54:14,341
but this feeling of gratitude

797
00:54:14,341 --> 00:54:17,641
is real...

798
00:54:18,341 --> 00:54:21,641

throughout my journey

800
00:54:30,741 --> 00:54:36,641
This is a beginning of a new chapter

801
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:44,341
in a path that is forged

802
00:54:45,141 --> 00:54:49,141
by wishes, hardwork,

803
00:54:49,141 --> 00:54:54,641
and lots of support

804
00:54:55,941 --> 00:55:00,141
for you, Risunes,

805
00:55:01,473 --> 00:55:03,003
I've made this song

806
00:55:04,403 --> 00:55:05,903
Let the time

807
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:08,703
send this song

808
00:55:09,803 --> 00:55:11,903
to more people

809
00:55:13,403 --> 00:55:15,403
as we wished for it

810
00:55:16,903 --> 00:55:19,003
Sing it out together

811
00:55:20,703 --> 00:55:22,903
Our hopes...

812
00:55:24,403 --> 00:55:26,903
Our dream...

813
00:55:27,903 --> 00:55:30,003
Surely...

814
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:34,703
it will reach the sky.

815
00:56:15,503 --> 00:56:20,803
While my eyes still see nearby
your soul start to fade...

816
00:56:20,803 --> 00:56:23,503
...unleash your magic to me.

817
00:56:23,603 --> 00:56:27,503
Now it's time not to worry, do believe in me.

818
00:56:27,603 --> 00:56:31,403
A journey we have to see.

819

Lodira lodira incomplete melody.

820
00:56:35,603 --> 00:56:39,603
Sung with a sweet but yet a sad symphony.

821
00:56:39,703 --> 00:56:43,903
An ever-rings spirit that you told me.

822
00:56:44,003 --> 00:56:48,603
How can I do it when you're not even here?

823
00:56:48,703 --> 00:56:52,603
Oh, let me...

824
00:56:52,703 --> 00:56:56,703
...let out all words I could say to you right now.

825
00:56:56,803 --> 00:57:01,003
I can only tell you a bit of overwhelm...

826
00:57:01,103 --> 00:57:05,603
...with your kindest assistance that I could
never ever trade with anything.

827
00:57:05,703 --> 00:57:11,603
Let the time send this song to your ears.

828
00:57:11,703 --> 00:57:17,503
I hope one day you will sing it to me.

829
00:57:17,603 --> 00:57:24,503
Words to the melody that I tried to write...

830
00:57:24,603 --> 00:57:26,603
...for you.

831
00:57:26,703 --> 00:57:30,203
Day by day I will pray my heart keeps on reaching...

832
00:57:30,303 --> 00:57:35,703
...the sky.

833
00:57:37,903 --> 00:57:42,703
In a time full of worries, no light I could see.

834
00:57:42,803 --> 00:57:47,003
Do you want me to be here?

835
00:57:47,103 --> 00:57:51,503
Knowing all the emotions you're supposed to feel...

836
00:57:51,603 --> 00:57:55,603
...even voice I want to hear.

837

Yeah...

842
00:58:16,603 --> 00:58:19,603
