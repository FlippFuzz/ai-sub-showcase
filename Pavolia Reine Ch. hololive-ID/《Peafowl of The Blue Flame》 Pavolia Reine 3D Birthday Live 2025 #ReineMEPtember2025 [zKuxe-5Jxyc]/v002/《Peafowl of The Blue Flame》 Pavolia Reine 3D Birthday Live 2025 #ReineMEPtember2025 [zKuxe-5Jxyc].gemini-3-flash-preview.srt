わっさわっさ 闇に宵闇
Swish-swish, evening gloom in the darkness

227
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:57,583
手抜き 手に入れた無理
Slacking off, impossible things obtained

228
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,283
それを大事にするんなら お前の売り
If you cherish that, it's your selling point

229
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:01,083
いつか来る 後悔
Regrets that will come someday

230
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,783
消せるか 今の自分次第
Whether you can erase them depends on your current self

00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,483
やるだけやったね だれかじゃなくて
You did what you could, not for someone else

232

未来の自分に嫌われないように
So as not to be hated by your future self

233
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:07,983
ひび割れてしまうのだって
Even if it ends up cracking

234
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:09,683
目の前を埋める壁だって
Even the wall that blocks your view

235
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:11,383
買って売るなら それで結構
If you sell it off as you please, that's fine

236
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,083
あとはひたすら前に進むだけ
From here on, just push forward

237
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:14,883
イェイ 誰に好かれれば満たされる
Yeah, who do you need to be liked by to feel satisfied

238
00:19:14,883 --> 00:19:16,583
ほどに こなした時が
When you've done it to that extent

239
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,383
爽快だろう
It must be exhilarating

240
00:19:19,703 --> 00:19:21,383
また 行けるはず
I should be able to go again

241
00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:28,083
まだ やれるはず

ぶっ飛ばせ場外
Blast it out of the park

248
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:44,683
多分で決めた限界なんて
Limits decided by "maybe"

249
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,383
挑戦以前の調査不足さ
Are just lack of research before the challenge

250
00:19:46,503 --> 00:19:48,083
ババババ そんな感じ
Ba-ba-ba-ba, something like that

251
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:49,783
ババババ いい子のアンチ
Ba-ba-ba-ba, anti-good-child

252
00:19:49,903 --> 00:19:51,483
心の警句に息を足せショックを
Add breath to the warning in your heart, the shock

253

Won't let anyone block my way to the top

No matter what happens, keep flourishing
Keep moving forward, eyes on the full voyage

261
00:20:19,796 --> 00:20:22,296
手にしたタガが本番　手広げて手のひら返しは論外
The limits I've seized are just the start

Yappapanabana, blast it out of the park!

266
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:05,446

Deciding limits in your head
Is naturally kicked aside, wait a second

267
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:07,846

00:21:35,246 --> 00:21:36,746
いい顔のアンジュ
With a great-looking face

282
00:21:36,746 --> 00:21:38,546
好景기에強奪
Snatching it up in a boom

283
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:40,346
音の鳴る方へ

299
00:22:54,946 --> 00:22:58,546
ありきたりなラブソングでも　愛が込められてるの
Even a generic love song
Can be filled with love

300
00:22:58,546 --> 00:23:01,746
それでも汚れるのなんて　君を見ればわかるの
But that it'll still get tarnished
I can tell just by looking at you

301
00:23:07,246 --> 00:23:09,046
下を向く君の目を
Those eyes of yours looking down

302
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:13,446
無理矢理剥ごうとはしない
I won't try to force them open

303
00:23:13,746 --> 00:23:18,746
だからそんな顔せず手を差し伸べてほら
So don't make that face, look, reach out your hand

304
00:23:18,846 --> 00:23:22,146
夜の始まりさ　バニーガール誘惑される
It's the start of the night
Being tempted by the bunny girl

305
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:25,546
言動に弾け飛ぶ　葛藤に愛を乾杯
Bursting with every word and action
A toast to love amidst the conflict

306
00:23:25,546 --> 00:23:30,146
伝えられなくても
Even if it can't be conveyed

307
00:23:30,746 --> 00:23:34,046
恋の始まりさ　バニーガールだらしねえ顔
It's the start of a romance
Bunny girl with a messy, relaxed face

308
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:40,746
穿って澄んだ　君の目を離さない
I won't let go of your piercing, clear eyes

309
00:23:53,546 --> 00:23:56,846
君の愛を知った気で　ハイになっていて
Thinking I've known your love, getting high on it

310
00:23:56,846 --> 00:24:00,146
感動去っていて　毎晩泣いていてさ
The emotion has faded, and I'm crying every night

311
00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:03,546
それくらいがいいんでしょ
That's just about right, isn't it?

312
00:24:05,446 --> 00:24:08,746
さあ刻めステップ刻んで
Come on, carve out the steps, carve them in

313
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:13,746
君の顔色今では　マシになってきてるから
Because your complexion is looking
A bit better now

314
00:24:29,346 --> 00:24:32,746
私をあげるわ　バニーガール誘惑される
I'll give you myself
Being tempted by the bunny girl

315
00:24:32,746 --> 00:24:36,046
言動に弾け飛ぶ　葛藤に愛を乾杯
Bursting with every word and action
A toast to love amidst the conflict

316
00:24:36,046 --> 00:24:40,746
伝えられてるはず
It should be conveyed by now

317
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,546
夜の始まりさ　バニーガールだらしねえ顔
It's the start of the night
Bunny girl with a messy, relaxed face

318
00:24:44,546 --> 00:24:50,746

わがまま　不機嫌も
Selfishness and bad moods too

377
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:42,427
もしかして今日は　優しくなでてくれるのかな
Maybe you'll stroke me gently today?

378
00:29:42,627 --> 00:29:45,127
君のそれで　耐えられるの
Can I endure it with yours?

379
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:48,227
生涯で私だけなんだよね
I'm the only one in your life, right?

だって偲ぶのだもん
Because I'm reminiscing

388
00:30:03,681 --> 00:30:07,101
この手叱られるだけだし
This hand will just get scolded anyway

389
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:10,591
今日だってちゃんとお膝でおとなしく
Even today, I'll be well-behaved on your lap

If I remember Pochi-mama, I remember Ojou-sama.
If I remember Pochi-mama, I remember "The Lady".

493
00:36:06,756 --> 00:36:09,956

00:36:10,156 --> 00:36:12,956
...ya gimana ya, I'm a princess.
...well, I'm a princess.

495

I'm still a work in progress, so I occasionally go out of pitch.

581
00:44:09,966 --> 00:44:15,366
その目に映らないだけだって やる気はメーター振り切っていて
Just because you can't see it in your eyes, my motivation is off the charts.

582
00:44:20,766 --> 00:44:26,166
いつでも全力で夢見て その分全力で眠って
Always dreaming with all my might, and sleeping with all my might as well.

柔軟に臨機応変千変万化
Flexible and adaptable, ever-changing.

586
00:44:52,466 --> 00:44:56,066

だって 本当は crazy
Because the truth is, I'm crazy.

588
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:00,866
孔雀たちはそう

Never sang in this genre, so I'm a little bit shy.

687
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:06,934

being placed in a box you don't exactly fit, it sucks, right?

695
00:50:26,934 --> 00:50:28,934
And this is some sort of, you know,

696
00:50:28,934 --> 00:50:30,934
it's a song of self-acceptance.

697
00:50:30,934 --> 00:50:33,934
And sometimes your flaws are what makes you, you.

698
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:36,434
And even if you're broken, it's fine.

699
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:39,934

700
