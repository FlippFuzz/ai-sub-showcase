00:30:09,993 --> 00:30:16,593
(Sighs) But yes, welcome to our first talking segment.

300
00:30:16,893 --> 00:30:20,593

00:45:34,379 --> 00:45:37,529
Prrrrrrr!

452
00:45:38,379 --> 00:45:41,329
You guessed it right! It is time for...

453
00:45:41,379 --> 00:45:46,179
...Birthday Goods Announcement! Woo!

454
00:45:46,979 --> 00:45:48,579
Pa-pa-pa-paaa!

455
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:52,679
Look at that beautiful, beautiful illustration.

456
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:56,579
We have multiple items today.

457
00:45:57,379 --> 00:46:03,579
We have the spicy 1000 ReineMat...

458
00:46:04,254 --> 00:46:07,579
...and the GWS+. Very nice, right?

459
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,329
I uh, you know, origin-, um, that came from my brain.

460
00:46:11,379 --> 00:46:13,579
I'm sure you guys love the name. Yes.

461
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:19,229
It's a big, big, big, big rubber mat and...

462
00:46:19,979 --> 00:46:23,379
...you know, look at this. It's a, yes, super big size.

463
00:46:23,479 --> 00:46:27,779
So maybe if you guys are used to small rubber mats, well this one's big...

464
00:46:27,879 --> 00:46:31,379
...so you know, big is good, I guess.

465
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:37,579
Uh, yeah, because its size is 60 by 90...

466
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,679
...and look at that beautiful art from Pochi-mama.

467
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:47,079
Look at that, my super neat room. No mess, so nice, right?

468
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:51,229
Yeah, what are you waiting for? Don't you want your own Reine room in your room?

469
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:53,779
Then you know what to do.

470
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:59,379
Spicy, so so so spicy. Reine's spicy room in your spicy room.

471
00:47:00,479 --> 00:47:05,579
And the second one, we also have a drinking mug, extra extra extra large size.

472
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:09,279
That's why, you know, today the theme is kind of big.

473
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:12,579
We have the small Raines, but our merch is big.

474
00:47:13,254 --> 00:47:17,779
Our drinking mug is actually extra large size with approximately 1-liter volume.

475
00:47:18,254 --> 00:47:22,179
So all of you, like, thirsty people, don't worry, you will never get thirsty...

476
00:47:22,279 --> 00:47:25,379
...as long as you watch Reine while you drink from this mug, okay?

477
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:29,079
Look at that beautiful, beautiful, beautiful art.

478
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,579
Look at that, so cute.

479
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:34,379
You would want one. Or two, or three, you know. It's alright.

480
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:36,279
Any amount is okay.

481
00:47:37,379 --> 00:47:41,579
And yeah, if you buy the merch as a set, you will get a bonus postcard.

482
00:47:43,379 --> 00:47:47,579
Which is very, very, very similar to the rubber mat...

483
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:50,079
...except it has a different expression.

484
00:47:50,179 --> 00:47:53,279
Look at that, so spicy. What a spicy expression.

485
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,779
And it comes with a handwritten autograph. Can you imagine it?

486
00:47:57,879 --> 00:48:02,254
Handwritten autograph in my Reine merch!

487
00:48:03,379 --> 00:48:05,479
Tunggu apa lagi, mudah sekali.
What are you waiting for, it's so easy.

488
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:08,579
So easy, guys. What are you waiting for?

489
00:48:09,779 --> 00:48:13,079
You know, I don't know if goods sales is open yet, but what are you waiting for?

490
00:48:13,179 --> 00:48:15,779
If it's not open, you know, just like be on standby.

491
00:48:16,254 --> 00:48:20,254
You know what to do. And yeah, so on the corner of the postcard...

492
00:48:20,379 --> 00:48:24,579
...you know, there'll be like a nice, nice signature, so cute, Reine.

493
00:48:24,979 --> 00:48:28,279
You know, you want your own authentic Reine signature, right?

494
00:48:28,379 --> 00:48:32,079
Yes, autograph, autograph, autograph.

495
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:36,579
Yes, so that is it, you know, after seeing this, you know, if you don't think...

496
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:40,579
"Oh, it's so cute, it's so spicy, I wanna buy it," then you will think that soon.

497
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:45,779
So, you know, just like be on standby and buy it as soon as it's available.

498
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:51,579
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Yay!

499
00:48:54,254 --> 00:48:56,379
Listen, listen, listen.

500
00:48:57,254 --> 00:48:59,579
This is not the end yet.

501
00:49:00,254 --> 00:49:05,579
You guys are here looking at, you know, how beautiful the whole thing is, the whole stage is.

502
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:09,579
Oh, yes. Thank you so much, Kanauru, for making this happen.

503
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:15,254
Well...

504
00:49:18,254 --> 00:49:20,079
This is not the end.

505
00:49:20,254 --> 00:49:23,254
After this, there will be one more song.

506
00:49:23,379 --> 00:49:27,079
Well, what song is it gonna be? Another one of those...

507
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:30,279
...well you know, another cover song?

508
00:49:31,254 --> 00:49:32,779
No.

509
00:49:33,254 --> 00:49:38,254
Reine finally singing her original song. Oh my god, really?

510
00:49:39,254 --> 00:49:43,779
And not just an original song, I'm gonna be singing my new original song...

511
00:49:43,879 --> 00:49:49,379
...which will be available starting September 10, 00:00 at your local time.

512
00:49:49,479 --> 00:49:52,579
So get ready for that.

513
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:53,779
Have you guys, are you guys ready?

514
00:49:53,879 --> 00:49:58,079
Your mouse is like, "I'm ready as soon as it's available," you know.

515
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:02,141
Yes!

516
00:50:02,241 --> 00:50:06,141
It's an English song, it's the very, very, very first time

517
00:50:06,241 --> 00:50:09,641
I'm singing an English song, and it's gonna be

518
00:50:09,741 --> 00:50:13,641
the first time you guys will be hearing this song
for the first time here. Okay?

519
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:17,641
Okay, what are you waiting for? So easy, muda sekali...
Okay, what are you waiting for? So easy, very easy...

520
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:22,641
...just sit back and listen and sing along maybe,
and dance along. Let's go!

521
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:26,641
Are you guys excited?

522
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:31,141
Get ready for Illusion Night!

523
00:50:36,641 --> 00:50:43,141
Illusion Night
Pavolia Reine

524
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:47,241
Kiss me, keep those lips from wandering off

525
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:51,141
Tell me every sweet and tender thought

526
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:54,941
Give me all you have to give and more

527
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:58,641
Fantasies where futures are born

528
00:50:58,841 --> 00:51:02,241
Can you feel the beat, the rhythm, the tune?

529
00:51:02,441 --> 00:51:05,941
Your heart and mine, the countdown

530
00:51:06,141 --> 00:51:09,641
If you feel something coming to you

531
00:51:09,841 --> 00:51:13,341
Believe it and scream it all out!

532
00:51:14,441 --> 00:51:17,941
I don't think I'll miss you any more
like I did the day you left

533
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:21,641
There's so many just like you I could use instead

534
00:51:21,841 --> 00:51:25,341
'Cause passion burning brightly hurts you in the end

535
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:29,041
Instead I'll swallow the pain

536
00:51:29,241 --> 00:51:32,741
Tomorrow's another today

537
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:37,441
Curtain calls at dawn, darling showtime

538
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:41,041
Spend the moment dancing in the moonlight

539
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:44,641
Till your gaze starts swaying with my body

540
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:47,441
Keep your eyes on me

541
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:51,041
Take me somewhere deep into the night

542
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:54,741
Touch me here, there, anywhere you like

543
00:51:54,841 --> 00:51:58,441
Trust me, won't you let me look inside?

544
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:02,041
Fantasies and futures collide

545
00:52:02,241 --> 00:52:07,141
It's just the two of us beneath the starry sky

546
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:12,841
If the only way to keep on living is keep on living strong

547
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:16,541
Then you can keep the kindness 'cause I'm moving on

548
00:52:16,741 --> 00:52:20,241
No use to say goodbye to me, I'm already gone

549
00:52:20,441 --> 00:52:23,941
So wipe all your tears away

550
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:27,641
I know we'll start over someday

551
00:52:28,741 --> 00:52:32,341
Curtain calls at dawn, darling showtime

552
00:52:42,641 --> 00:52:45,441
All your heart, your soul, your body

553
00:52:45,641 --> 00:52:49,141
You belong to one and only

554
00:52:49,341 --> 00:52:52,841
Unconditionally yearning

555
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:56,541
Knowing no one else will do

556
00:52:56,741 --> 00:53:00,141
Can you feel the bond between us grow tight?

557
00:53:00,341 --> 00:53:03,841
We're closer than we've ever been

558
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:07,541
Follow me, match your rhythm to mine

559
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:11,241
And let it all out from within

560
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:15,741
I don't think I'll miss you any more
than I did the day you left

561
00:53:15,941 --> 00:53:19,541
I won't say I love you, I know I'll take it back

562
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:23,241
I'm used to this, I'm not the same old little bird

563
00:53:23,441 --> 00:53:26,941
Burned from flickering candles and then could never last

564
00:53:27,141 --> 00:53:30,641
Instead of living in past

565
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:35,241
Forward's the perfect place for lovers like us
to take a chance

566
00:53:35,441 --> 00:53:38,941
There's nothing here to stop us when in rom-romance

567
00:53:39,141 --> 00:53:42,641
And I won't let you leave me alone without a doubt

568
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:46,241
I don't want to hear a goodbye

569
00:53:46,441 --> 00:53:49,941
Don't break the illusion tonight

570
00:53:50,141 --> 00:53:53,741
Curtain calls at dawn, darling showtime

571
00:53:53,841 --> 00:53:57,341
Stay forever living till the sunrise

572
00:53:57,541 --> 00:54:01,041
Feel so lucky even with the lights off

573
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:03,641
Dance until we drop

574
00:54:07,141 --> 00:54:20,141
THANK YOU
My M-chan, Kanauru, Farhan, Chroneco, Holoro

575
00:54:21,141 --> 00:54:40,141
This is for you
Thank you so much for always supporting me
I will keep doing my best!
