A girl was studying...

00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,800

[A FEW YEARS LATER]

7
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,800
Who can show me a blue illumination spell?

8
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,800
Oh come on, you should all know this by now!

9
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,200
Pavolia Reine.

10
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,400
Yes!

11
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Amazing work, Miss Reine!

12
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,900
Amazing, Reine!

13
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,400
Teach me!!

14
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,400
How did you become so good, Reine?!

15
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,400
Oh, it's just a lot of studying!

16
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,300
Can you share us your routine?!

17
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,300
Sure!

18
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,400
Every day, I wake up at 5am.

19
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,600
I take a shower,

20
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,400
do some exercises,

21
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,900
and make a cup of tea!

22
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,200
Then I go through just 4 or 5

23
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
spellbook volumes before class.

24
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,400
Oh no...

25
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,400
That's kinda hard...

26
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,400
It's not that bad once you get used to it!

27
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,400
I bet you're gonna score perfectly
on the potions exam today.

28
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,900
Potions?

29
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,400
Exam?

30
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,800
Oh no.

31
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,800
How could I forget!!!

32
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,000
Ah. It's marked as pancake day.

33
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,500
PANCAKE DAY!

34
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Why did I remember pancake day
and not the potion exam?!

35
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,800
I guess 4 hours of sleep is catching up to me...

36
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,800
Well! Whatever! I'll do my best!

And... you may all begin!

43
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,400
A bit of this... and a bit of that...

44
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,400
Wait...

45
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,400
Miss Reine, is your potion quite alright?

46
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,900
Yes, teacher! It should be...

47
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,500
I added in unicorn hair,

48
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,400
and a dash of cinnamon.

49
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,400
A dash of cinnamon?! No!!

50
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
That's a portal potion, Reine!!

51
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,400
Wha-?!

52
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,400
Did my memory get jumbled?!

53
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
Everyone, get to the back of the classroom!!!

54
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,800
Why did I try to

55
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,600
speed-read the entire compendium?!

56
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,233
NOOO!!!

57
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,133

00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:51,557
And we can clean this too.

339
00:19:56,557 --> 00:19:57,857
Many, many, many things.

340
00:19:58,257 --> 00:19:59,857
ああ、いいですね。
Ah, it's nice.

341
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:04,269
In here... fishing, fishing...

342
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,469
And then we go to this very, very

343
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:10,569
special place... chu chu chu,

344
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:12,769
my PC.

345
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:17,369
And oh, this is my... my desk mat with a...

346
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:20,469
specially drawn by Anya Melfissa.

347
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:24,469
And "Love me, love me" also.

348
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:27,169
Look, it's Holoro Desk Mat. Would you buy this?

349
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:28,969
I think this is very nice,

350
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:31,569
but too bad it's exclusive for me and me only for now.

351
00:20:32,469 --> 00:20:33,869
Whoo!

352
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:35,069
Okay.

353
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:36,169
Whoo!

354
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,469
Okay. I think... that's enough cleaning, right?

355
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:44,269
Let's just take a little break.

356
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:46,569
Ah... ah...

357
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:48,869
Atatata...
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

358
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:51,369
Whoo!

359
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:54,669
Ah, I'm satisfied.

360
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:59,369
And I think now it's time for someone to visit.

361
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:03,969
あの娘も呼んじゃおうかな。
Maybe I'll call that girl too.

362
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:09,169
Say it with me. Three, two, one...

363
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,469
Tatang!

364
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:15,869
Tatang! Oh!

365
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:18,469
Many, many Tatang!

366
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:21,069
Tatang!

367
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:22,869
Tatang!

368
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:25,869
Oh, look at these Tatangs. OMG.

369
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:28,469
Tatang!

370
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:32,169
I've just cleaned this room.

371
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:34,369
さっきお掃除したばっかりなのにね。
I just finished cleaning, too.

372
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:37,469
Oh my God. Well, let's pick up one, okay?

373
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,869
Many, many Tatang. Yay!

374
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:48,369
Hello!

375
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:50,069
Tatang!

376
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:53,369
Tatang! Yay! Look at this. Whoo!

377
00:21:55,769 --> 00:22:00,069
Tatang was lost, but he is here.

378
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:04,669
He comes to my 3D showcase! OMG.

379
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:08,569
こちら, come here. Wow.
Over here, come here. Wow.

380
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:11,869
Oh, ading jatuh. Many, many Tatang falling.
Oh, one fell. Many, many Tatang falling.

381
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:14,369
Oh my God. So yeah. Well...

382
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:17,369
Whoo! Tatang. Please.

383
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:22,769
A Tatang, Tatang. I want to... I need to clean this room.

384
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:27,269
So, room, please. Tatang, I like it that you're... ini.
So, room, please. Tatang, I like it that you're... this.

385
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:32,369
I like it that you're falling down, but I need to cleaning. Okay?

386
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:37,669
So we can... we can move on to the guest segment, right?

387
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:40,469
I've got a lot of special guests today actually.

388
00:22:40,469 --> 00:22:43,769
そうですね、ゲストパートに行きましょうか。
That's right, let's head to the guest segment.

389
00:22:44,469 --> 00:22:48,369
Yeah. Tatang! Tatang! Let's come back later.

390
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:51,669
Whoo! Shoo shoo. Thank you. Thank you Tatang.

391
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:53,569
We'll play again later.

392
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:57,669
そうですね、今日はスペシャルゲストがたくさん来るよ。
That's right, many special guests are coming today.

393
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,669
And... where is the special guest, I wonder?

394
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:03,469
Mana ya? Tamu nya?
Where are they? The guest?

395
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:07,469
Oh! Looks like somebody's already here.

396
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,569
Oh, let's set the room up so we're ready for them. Okay?

397
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:13,369
部屋も準備するね。
I'll get the room ready too.

398
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:16,869
行け！チェンジ！
Go! Change!

399
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:34,069
真夏は誰のモノ？
Lyrics: 畑 亜貴 Composition・Arrangement: 原田 篤
Whose midsummer is it?
Lyrics: Aki Hata Composition/Arrangement: Atsushi Harada

400
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:32,969
赤い太陽のドレスで踊る
Dancing in a dress of the red sun

401
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:36,569
私のこと見つめているの
Are you staring at me?

402
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:40,269
目を逸らしたい でも逸らせない
I want to look away, but I can't

403
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:45,369
あぁ 情熱で焼けたい
Ah, I want to burn with passion

404
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:04,369
トキメキ以上のリズム
A rhythm more than excitement

405
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:08,369
今宵 知りたくて
I want to know tonight

406
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:12,369
いつもより大胆な
Bolder than usual

407
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:15,569
言葉を呟いた
I whispered the words

408
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:19,469
自分の気持ちなのに
Even though they're my own feelings

409
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:23,269
全然 分からなく
I don't understand them at all

410
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:26,469
理性がいま指令
My reason is now giving orders

411
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:29,469
コントロール不可能
Impossible to control

412
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:34,369
正体不明の恋が 届いてしまった
An unknown love has arrived

413
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:38,469
恥ずかしく思うけど
I feel embarrassed, but...

414
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:42,269
もっと知りたいの もっと知りたいの
I want to know more, I want to know more

415
00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:46,369
いけない 夢だと気づきながら
While realizing it's a forbidden dream

416
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:50,469
赤い太陽のドレスで踊る
Dancing in a dress of the red sun

417
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:54,169
私のこと見つめる瞳
Eyes that gaze at me

418
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:57,769
目を逸らしたい でも逸らせない
I want to look away, but I can't

419
00:24:57,769 --> 00:25:00,069
真夏は
Midsummer is...

420
00:25:00,081 --> 00:30:00,081
真夏は誰のモノ？
Who does midsummer belong to?

421
00:25:00,081 --> 00:26:32,581
真夏は誰のモノ？
Who does midsummer belong to?

422
00:25:01,406 --> 00:25:05,493
あなたと私のモノにしたくて
I want to make it yours and mine

423
00:25:05,493 --> 00:25:10,105
心が止まらない季節に
In a season where my heart won't stop

424
00:25:10,105 --> 00:25:13,716
初めて胸の扉が
For the first time, the door to my heart

425
00:25:13,716 --> 00:25:17,427
開いてしまいそうよ
Seems about to open

426
00:25:17,427 --> 00:25:20,231
You knock knock my heart

427
00:25:33,301 --> 00:25:36,612
ためらいがちのステップが
My hesitant steps

428
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:39,923
熱く変わる頃
By the time they turn hot

429
00:25:39,923 --> 00:25:43,434
いつもならあり得ない
Usually impossible

430
00:25:43,434 --> 00:25:47,545
衝動に戸惑うの
I'm bewildered by this impulse

431
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,956
あなたの手に
In your hand

432
00:25:49,956 --> 00:25:52,567
私の手を
My hand

433
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:56,678
重ねたら何かが始まる
When they overlap, something begins

434
00:25:56,678 --> 00:26:00,393
オーレイ！花火が照らす横顔
Olé! Your profile lit by fireworks

435
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:04,204
きっとこの日が来ると予感してた
I surely had a premonition this day would come

436
00:26:04,204 --> 00:26:07,515
もう戻れない
Can't go back anymore

437
00:26:07,515 --> 00:26:08,926
戻りたくない
Don't want to go back

438
00:26:08,926 --> 00:26:12,437
真夏に誘われて
Lured by midsummer

439
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,648
あなたと私の夏にしたくて
I want to make it yours and my summer

440
00:26:15,648 --> 00:26:19,459
心が止まらない季節よ
It's a season where my heart won't stop

441
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:23,170
甘く切ない香りで
With a sweet and painful scent

442
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:27,481
不意に泣きたくなる気がしたの
I felt like I suddenly wanted to cry

443
00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:45,904
近付いたり離れたりの
Approaching and distancing

444
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,615
ドンステ！頭シビれてる
Don't stop! My head is tingling

445
00:26:49,615 --> 00:26:51,426
ここにいてよ
Stay here

446
00:26:51,426 --> 00:26:53,437
ここにいてよ
Stay here

447
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:57,248
もう怖くないの
I'm not afraid anymore

448
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:00,159
何もかもが
Everything

449
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,370
紅い太陽のドレスで踊る
Dancing in a dress of the red sun

450
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,781
私のこと見つめる瞳
Eyes staring at me

451
00:27:07,781 --> 00:27:11,892
目そらしたい
Want to look away

452
00:27:11,892 --> 00:27:12,803
でもそらせない
But can't look away

453
00:27:12,803 --> 00:27:15,914
真夏は誰のモノ？
Who does midsummer belong to?

454
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:19,525
あなたと私のモノにしたくて
I want to make it yours and mine

455
00:27:19,525 --> 00:27:23,536
心が止まらない季節
A season where my heart won't stop

456
00:27:23,536 --> 00:27:26,647
初めて胸の扉が
For the first time, the door to my heart

457
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:30,258
開いてしまいそうよ
Seems about to open

458
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:34,169
You knock knock my heart

459
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:37,580
ああ 情熱的に
Ah, passionately

460
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,891
抱きしめて
Hold me tight

461
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:07,681
Waaaah!

462
00:28:07,681 --> 00:28:10,131
And that was Manatsu wa Dare no Mono?

463
00:28:10,131 --> 00:28:13,342
And my guest was Kiara!

464
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:16,153
Kikiriki!

465
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:19,564
Holo holo holo holo! Oh, already high!

466
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:26,081
Hololive English no Takanashi Kiara desu! Hi! Yay!
I'm Takanashi Kiara from Hololive English! Hi! Yay!

467
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:32,481
I was invited to my little bird Kouhai's showcase! So exciting!

468
00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:38,281
Thank you for being such a strict... yeah yeah yeah.

469
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:44,881
We had only one dance lesson together where there was no teacher.

470
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:49,381
So I took the yakume, the position of the teacher.
So I took the role, the position of the teacher.

471
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:52,481
And when Reine was on the floor taking a break, I was like...

472
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,731
Reine get up!

473
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:55,281
Nooo!

474
00:28:55,281 --> 00:28:56,631
You have to dance!

475
00:28:56,631 --> 00:28:57,881
Nooo!

476
00:28:57,881 --> 00:28:59,131
Get up! Go!

477
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:02,181
We have no time! We have the studio for two hours only!

478
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:03,531
I want to review the floor instead.

479
00:29:03,531 --> 00:29:05,381
Oh oh, this floor...

480
00:29:05,381 --> 00:29:07,531
is very nice.

481
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:08,881
Yeah, we can review this floor.

482
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:10,631
What do you think about the sound?

483
00:29:10,631 --> 00:29:13,281
Well, I mean, it should be wood. Do we hear the wood?

484
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:15,631
(Taps floor) It doesn't seem to be wood.

485
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:18,581
Reine, we knock knock the floor.

486
00:29:18,581 --> 00:29:21,131
We knock knock the floor!

487
00:29:21,131 --> 00:29:23,881
It's mystery flooring, but it's 10 out of 10.

488
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:25,431
10 out of 10! Bird approved.

489
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,781
I think to you, every floor is 10 out of 10.

490
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:30,431
It is, as long as it's cool enough to lie down on.

491
00:29:30,431 --> 00:29:33,081
Oh my god, really quickly! We have to do some cute poses, okay?

492
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:34,331
Okay okay okay.

493
00:29:34,331 --> 00:29:37,481
I want to do this. (Aww/Ohohoho)

494
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:40,531
Screenshot time!

495
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:44,281
Use Reine birthday hashtag, it's somewhere up there.

496
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:45,431
It's up there!

497
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:46,481
And I want to do a hug.

498
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:47,531
Ah, yes.

499
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:51,381
Ojo-chan! Gyu gyu gyu!
Ojo-chan! Squeeze squeeze squeeze!

500
00:29:51,381 --> 00:29:53,431
And let's do back-to-back, like a shoot pose.

501
00:29:53,431 --> 00:29:54,381
Shoot pose?

502
00:29:54,381 --> 00:29:57,531
Like secret agent. Secret agent.

503
00:29:57,531 --> 00:30:00,081

Screenshot? Apa aja boleh sebenarnya. Baik-baik saja juga seru gitu lho.
Screenshot? Anything goes, really. Just being 'seiso' (pure) is also fun.

603

Kalau gitu yang seiso dulu ya, yang seiso. Aku tadi tuh ya tercengang-cengang melihat pose Reine dari samping.
In that case, let's do a pure one first. I was just amazed looking at Reine's pose from the side.

604
00:35:48,505 --> 00:35:54,105
Aku mau Reine pose menyamping pegang pinggang.
I want Reine to pose sideways with hands on her hips.

605

Oh, oke. Ya gitu deh pokoknya. Ya agak sebisanya ya guys.
Oh, okay. Well, something like that. I'll do my best, guys.

And so what we're going to do is I'm accepting requests
from you for screenshot time. I'll do any pose for you.

726
00:43:52,617 --> 00:43:59,617
Alright, I'll go first. I'll go ahead and make it easy,
rip the band-aid off. Show us your panties.

727
00:44:00,117 --> 00:44:02,617
HO! What!? Calli!

Just do it! Just... What!?
It's what they want to see!

729
00:44:06,117 --> 00:44:11,617
Ah... Hear me out, that's why I was
thinking kicky-kicky-kick.

730
00:44:12,117 --> 00:44:13,617
Calli, is this what you're always thinking?

731
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:17,617
No, I'm just thinking about the fans! Oh! Whoa!

732
00:44:17,617 --> 00:44:22,617
Whoa whoa! What just happened? I saw the magic!
I've seen behind the curtain!

733
00:44:23,117 --> 00:44:27,617
Suddenly I don't remember anything!
What? Spaghetti beam!

734
00:44:28,117 --> 00:44:30,117
Anyways, what's next?

735
00:44:30,617 --> 00:44:33,617
I want to see a close-up of your ribs.

736
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:36,617
My this? This? Ribs?

737
00:44:37,117 --> 00:44:41,117
Ribs! Close up! Oh man, and
waki-pai at the same time!

738
00:44:41,117 --> 00:44:46,117
It's a double-decker! That's not even allowed!
My! Whoa whoa!

739
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:49,117
Gura, how do you not have those? Are those like gills?

740
00:44:49,117 --> 00:44:54,117
Gills? No! Do you have those?
What the hell? Gills?

741
00:44:55,117 --> 00:44:59,117
Okay! Any more requests? I got something
to show you too actually after this.

742
00:45:00,129 --> 00:45:01,129
Surprised.

743
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:03,129
I want to see you do a bridge.

744
00:45:03,629 --> 00:45:04,629
A bridge?

745
00:45:04,629 --> 00:45:05,629
Yes.

746
00:45:05,629 --> 00:45:08,129
A bridge like "kayang" desu ka?
A bridge like "kayang" (bridge pose)?

747
00:45:08,129 --> 00:45:10,129
Kayang lagi, emang ngerti?
Bridge again, do they even understand?

748
00:45:10,129 --> 00:45:13,129
You have to like, lie down first? This is dangerous.

749
00:45:13,129 --> 00:45:14,129
How limber are you?

750
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:15,629
I don't know!

751
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:18,129
(Grunts)

752
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:19,129
Cameraman!

753
00:45:19,129 --> 00:45:21,129
Nice! So limber.

754
00:45:22,129 --> 00:45:25,629
Cameraman was not really keyed in on the memo there.

755
00:45:26,629 --> 00:45:28,129
Damn it!

756
00:45:28,129 --> 00:45:31,129
No, no more rebroadcast. Sorry, sorry.

757
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:33,629
We'll get them next time.

758
00:45:33,629 --> 00:45:35,629
I gotta show you something.

759
00:45:35,629 --> 00:45:37,129
Do you know who this is?

760
00:45:37,629 --> 00:45:38,629
Show it, show it.

761
00:45:38,629 --> 00:45:41,129
Mister... Tamboree!

762
00:45:41,129 --> 00:45:43,129
Tatang!

763
00:45:43,129 --> 00:45:44,129
Big old Tatang.

764
00:45:44,129 --> 00:45:46,129
Tatang! It looks like a post office.

765
00:45:46,629 --> 00:45:49,129
My beloved... My beloved Tatang.

766
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:53,129
And I want to... say a little bit of something.

767
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:57,129
This Tatang can grow big.

768
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,129
You know Tatang is small, right?

769
00:45:59,129 --> 00:46:01,129
Like your chest?

770
00:46:01,629 --> 00:46:04,129
Hmm? Eh? Eh?

771
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:06,629
No, no, no. Reine's Tatangs are not small.

772
00:46:06,629 --> 00:46:08,629
Yes. So like if you feel like...

773
00:46:08,629 --> 00:46:10,629
Wait, I'm just going to demonstrate it to you.

774
00:46:10,629 --> 00:46:12,629
What? They're not. Of course they're not.

775
00:46:12,629 --> 00:46:15,129
I mean, you just said they can get bigger?

776
00:46:15,129 --> 00:46:16,629
Oh broke. Tatang's going to get wet.

777
00:46:16,629 --> 00:46:18,129
With this tea! Oh no!

778
00:46:18,129 --> 00:46:21,129
With this tea, you can...

779
00:46:21,129 --> 00:46:24,129
(Gulp sounds) Oh God! I see...

780
00:46:24,129 --> 00:46:26,129
Oh! Whoa! It's like a sponge!

781
00:46:26,629 --> 00:46:29,129
And he's peeing it out right away! It's going right through him!

782
00:46:29,629 --> 00:46:31,129
It's...

783
00:46:31,129 --> 00:46:33,629
Big Tatang! Big Tatang!

784
00:46:34,629 --> 00:46:38,129
So if you guys feel like you want to, maybe for example...

785
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,629
...grow bigger and stronger...

786
00:46:41,629 --> 00:46:44,629
...like have a bigger heart or something...

787
00:46:44,629 --> 00:46:46,129
IRyS needs that. Yeah.

788
00:46:46,129 --> 00:46:50,129
You guys can call me and order this tea from me.

789
00:46:50,129 --> 00:46:53,129
Everybody join the "Royalty".

790
00:46:53,629 --> 00:46:57,129
So if you know, if the tofu has a little problem or something...

791
00:46:58,629 --> 00:47:01,129
Whoa, yeah. I don't specifically need anything like that.

792
00:47:02,129 --> 00:47:05,629
But yeah, I'm just saying... I'm not mentioning any names.

793
00:47:05,629 --> 00:47:07,629
Will it make me grow bigger everywhere?

794
00:47:07,629 --> 00:47:12,129
Everywhere? Of course! Voluptuous Gura coming up soon.

795
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:16,129
If you take a bath with it every single day, then maybe...

796
00:47:16,129 --> 00:47:19,629
Oh! I'm going to take a lot of tea.

797
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:25,129
Sounds like my mom telling me to drink milk every day of my childhood life.

798
00:47:25,629 --> 00:47:28,129
Exactly! It's better! Even better!

799
00:47:29,129 --> 00:47:30,629
Oops, where do I put this?

800
00:47:32,129 --> 00:47:34,129
Sign me up.

801
00:47:34,129 --> 00:47:36,629
I don't know what I want to grow, but it sounds cool.

802
00:47:36,629 --> 00:47:38,629
We need stuff like that in our lives.

803
00:47:38,629 --> 00:47:40,629
Of course.

804
00:47:40,629 --> 00:47:44,129
You know. Okay, thank you so much for coming to the call.

805
00:47:46,629 --> 00:47:49,129

Illusion Night

959
00:58:41,353 --> 00:58:44,353
Kiss me ふらつかないで
Kiss me, don't stagger

960
00:58:44,653 --> 00:58:48,153
Tell me 甘い言葉で
Tell me with sweet words

961
00:58:48,653 --> 00:58:52,153
Give me 君のすべてを
Give me all of you

962
00:58:52,353 --> 00:58:55,653
今この幻想で
Now in this illusion

963
00:58:56,653 --> 00:59:02,653
ただつながる時間 委ねていてね
Just surrender to the time we're connected

964
00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:09,653
声を枯らすくらい 心臓で叫べ
Shout with your heart until your voice goes hoarse

965
00:59:12,153 --> 00:59:19,153
今更恋なんて思わない 変わりはいくらでもいるわ
I won't think of it as love now; there are plenty of replacements

966
00:59:19,653 --> 00:59:26,653
熱く燃えるほど愛おしくて 騒がしい街へ
So dear as it burns hotly, to the noisy city

967
00:59:27,653 --> 00:59:30,153
また夜が明けて
And the dawn breaks again

968
00:59:31,153 --> 00:59:37,653
まだまだ終わらない Show time ほら踊り明かそう
Show time isn't over yet, hey, let's dance the night away

969
00:59:38,153 --> 00:59:44,353
クラクラしちゃうくらいに 見つめてね
Stare at me until you feel dizzy

970
00:59:45,153 --> 00:59:48,653
Take me 深い夜まで
Take me until the deep night

971
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:52,153
Touch me 気の向くままに
Touch me as you please

972
00:59:52,653 --> 00:59:59,586
Trust me 夢いざなう 飽きるまでずっと
Trust me, I'll invite you into a dream, forever until you're tired of it

973
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:02,465
...にして二人きりなら
...if it's just the two of us...

974
01:00:06,265 --> 01:00:09,565
強く生き続けることを称えよう
Let's celebrate our strength to keep on living.

975
01:00:10,165 --> 01:00:13,465
優しい私は昼の祝い
The gentle me is a blessing of the day.

976
01:00:14,065 --> 01:00:17,465
さよならは必要ないから
Because there's no need for goodbyes...

977
01:00:17,965 --> 01:00:20,565
構わないでね
...don't worry about me.

978
01:00:21,165 --> 01:00:24,565
いつか戻るから
Because I'll return someday.

979
01:00:39,265 --> 01:00:42,865
正直な気持ち知って　私をもっと止めて
Knowing my honest feelings, stop me even more.

980
01:00:43,165 --> 01:00:46,665
曖昧にしないで　他は要らないでしょ
Don't be vague, you don't need anyone else, right?

981
01:00:46,965 --> 01:00:50,265
心繋がる場所で　強く感じたら
If you feel it strongly in the place where our hearts connect...

982
01:01:01,165 --> 01:01:04,465
声を枯らしてでも
Even if your voice goes hoarse...

983
01:01:04,865 --> 01:01:08,165
心臓で叫べ
...scream with your heart!

984
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:13,665
今更恋しいなんて思わない
I won't think I miss you now.

985
01:01:14,065 --> 01:01:17,365
愛してるなんて言わないわ
I won't say I love you.

986
01:01:17,765 --> 01:01:21,165
代わりは誰もいないから
Because there's no one else like you.

987
01:01:21,565 --> 01:01:24,865
熱く燃える炎を通して
Through the hotly burning flames...

988
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:31,865
騒がしい夜の中　二人だけの世界で踊ろう
In the noisy night, let's dance in a world just for the two of us.

989
01:01:32,265 --> 01:01:35,465
邪魔するものは何もないわ
There's nothing to stand in our way.

990
01:01:35,865 --> 01:01:39,265
さよならは言わせないからね
I won't let you say goodbye.

991
01:01:39,665 --> 01:01:42,965
心地好い夢へ
Into a pleasant dream...

992
01:01:43,365 --> 01:01:46,765
続く Illusion Night
...the Illusion Night continues.

993
01:01:47,165 --> 01:01:50,465
まだまだ終わらない Showtime
The showtime isn't over yet.

994
01:01:50,865 --> 01:01:54,165
ほら踊り明かそうや
Come on, let's dance the night away.

995
01:01:54,565 --> 01:01:57,865
クラクラしちゃうくらいに
Until we get dizzy...

996
01:01:58,265 --> 01:02:00,765
弾けてね

997
