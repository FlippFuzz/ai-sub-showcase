00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:53,811
Take me somewhere deep into the night...

144
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:57,711
Touch me - here, there, anywhere you like!

145
00:26:57,911 --> 00:27:01,511
Trust me! Won't you let me look inside?

146
00:27:01,811 --> 00:27:04,811
Fantasies and futures collide...

147
00:27:04,911 --> 00:27:09,811
It's just the two of us beneath the starry sky...

148
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:15,811
If the only way to keep on living is "Keep on living strong!"

149
00:27:15,911 --> 00:27:19,511
Then you can keep the kindness 'cause I'm moving on!

150
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:22,811
No need to say goodbye to me - I'm already gone!

151
00:27:22,911 --> 00:27:26,511
Just wipe all your tears away

152
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:30,311
And know we'll start over someday...

153
00:27:45,311 --> 00:27:48,811
All your heart, your soul, your body...

154
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:52,311
You belong to one and only!

155
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:55,811
Unconditionally yearning,

156
00:27:55,911 --> 00:27:59,311
Knowing no one else will do...

157
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,711
Can you feel the bond between us grow tight?

158
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:06,111
We're closer than we've ever been!

159
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:09,511
Follow me! Match your rhythm to mine,

160
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:13,811
And let it all out from within!

161
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:17,411
I don't think I miss you anymore

162
00:28:17,411 --> 00:28:19,311
than I did the day you left.

163
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:22,511
I won't say "I love you." I know I'll take it back!

164
00:28:22,611 --> 00:28:26,511
I'm used to this, I'm not the same old loser that

165
00:28:26,811 --> 00:28:30,311
Burned bright and quick, where candles and wind could never last!

166
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:34,111
A city that's living in fast-forward's

167
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:37,511
The perfect place for lovers like us to take a chance!

168
00:28:37,611 --> 00:28:41,311
There's nothing here to stop us when in Rome, romance!

169
00:28:41,411 --> 00:28:44,811
And I won't let you leave me alone without a dance!

170
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:48,111
I don't wanna' hear a goodbye...

171
00:28:48,411 --> 00:28:52,511
Don't break the illusion tonight...

172
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:56,111
Curtain call at dawn, darling! SHOWTIME!

173
00:28:56,311 --> 00:29:00,311
Spend forever living 'til the SUNRISE!

174
00:29:00,411 --> 00:29:03,511
Feel that look, even with the lights off,

175
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:05,911
Dance until we drop!

176
00:29:13,811 --> 00:29:16,511
Wow! Hello everybody!

177
00:29:16,611 --> 00:29:18,511

00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:17,041
Tapi jadi sekarang tuh pengennya tuh yang
'oh aku mau mengasih lihat yang keren' gitu.
But now, I want to show a "cool" side.

208
00:30:48,521 --> 00:30:50,241
Well they're not here right now though.

209
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:53,681
The audio spectrums, they move in sync with the music.

210
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:55,881
For those who didn't notice,

211
00:30:55,961 --> 00:30:58,961

I've also prepared a setlist with songs

Biar cocok sama vibe rave-nya ne.
To match the rave vibe.

219
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:23,001
Pokoknya the songs are very, very rave-boy deh.
Anyway, the songs are very, very rave-boy.

235
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:06,281
Ganti baju dulu guys.
Changing clothes first, guys.

可愛げな KISS で 1, 2, 3
With a cute kiss, 1, 2, 3

243
00:32:57,281 --> 00:33:00,601
目線そらして ズルいよね
Turning your eyes away, that's unfair

244
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:03,921
火照り出す 僕の気持ち
My feelings start to flush

245
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:07,361
もてあそぶみたいで
It's like you're toying with me

246
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:10,801
追いかけちゃ だめなのは
I know I shouldn't chase you

247
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:14,201
わかってる でも無理さ
I know, but it's impossible

248
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:18,801
一度踏み出せば 戻れなくて
Once I take a step forward, I can't go back

249
00:33:19,201 --> 00:33:21,881
仮面は脱ぎ捨てて
Throw away the mask

250
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:24,761
いけない 言葉で
With forbidden words

251
00:33:25,241 --> 00:33:28,321
遊びが本気になる
The play becomes serious

252
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:33,481
DADDY ! DADDY ! DO ! 欲しいのさ
DADDY ! DADDY ! DO ! I want it

騙されたら それでもいい
If I'm deceived, that's fine too

255
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:45,721
もっと震わせて 魅せてくれ
Make me tremble more, show me

256
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:48,441
僕だけに 笑顔の裏まで
To only me, even behind your smile

257

愛に抱かれ ギラギラ 燃えてしまいたい
Embraced by love, I want to burn brilliantly

258
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,361
躊躇など しない No No No
I won't hesitate, no no no

259
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:09,721
二度と逢えない ひとだから
Because you're someone I'll never meet again

260
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:13,721
後悔に 触れるのなら
If I'm going to feel regret

261
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:16,801
恋の火に 焼かれたい
I want to be burned by the fire of love

262
00:34:17,761 --> 00:34:21,001
わざとでしょう 流し目が
Your sidelong glance must be intentional

263
00:34:21,281 --> 00:34:23,761
愛しさを 刺激する
It stimulates my affection

264
00:34:24,721 --> 00:34:27,801
そっと振り返る 美しさに
Turning back gently, at your beauty

265
00:34:28,561 --> 00:34:31,761
心はつかまれて
My heart is captured

266
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:34,721
呼吸が 止まって
My breathing stops

267
00:34:35,681 --> 00:34:38,801
遊びが本気になる
The play becomes serious

268
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:43,441
DADDY ! DADDY ! DO ! ぶつけたい
DADDY ! DADDY ! DO ! I want to strike

269
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:46,801
想いのすべてを
All of my feelings

270
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:50,361
綺麗なもの だけじゃなくて
Not just the beautiful things

271
00:34:50,641 --> 00:34:53,801
危険な願いも
But dangerous wishes too

272
00:34:54,521 --> 00:34:59,281
止めないで その声が 僕を連れていく
Don't stop, that voice leads me away

273
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:05,154
愛に抱かれ ギラギラ 燃えてしまいたい
Embraced by love, I want to burn brilliantly

274
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:07,131
燃えてしまいたい
I want to burn away

275
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:16,631
「あなただけ」と言うくちびるが
The lips that say "only you"

276
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:22,331
優しく微笑むたび
Every time they smile gently

277
00:35:22,931 --> 00:35:26,231
飲み込まれて
I'm swallowed up

278
00:35:26,531 --> 00:35:29,731
いざなわれて
I'm lured in

279
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:33,031
未知の世界
An unknown world

280
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:37,731
触れて
Touching it

281
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:40,631
OH OH

282
00:35:43,031 --> 00:35:47,131
最後まで　あなたにゆだねて
Entrusting myself to you until the end

283
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:50,631
壊れるならそれでもいい
If I break, that's fine too

284
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:54,331
もっと狂わせて
Drive me more crazy

285
00:35:54,731 --> 00:35:57,831
魅せてくれ　僕だけに
Enchant me, only for me

286
00:35:58,231 --> 00:36:01,331
こころの奥まで
To the depths of my heart

287
00:36:01,731 --> 00:36:03,631
愛に抱かれ
Embraced by love

288
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:07,331
ギラギラ燃えたい
I want to burn brightly

289
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:12,731
いのち果てる夜明けまで
Until the dawn when life ends

290
00:36:50,331 --> 00:36:55,331
PaIII.SENSATION

291
00:37:04,031 --> 00:37:08,331
暫く暮れて眠れる日々も
The days when I could sleep after dark

292
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:13,831
今夜辺りサヨナラできる気がする
I feel like I can say goodbye tonight

293
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:18,331
胸の昂り見透かされたい
I want my heart's excitement to be seen through

294
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:24,331
嬉し知らずの気持ち隠しても
Even if I hide my feelings of unknown joy

295
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:29,331
既に遅いわ夜も連れ
It's already too late, take the night with you

296
00:37:29,631 --> 00:37:32,331
今から全てで飛ばしてあげる
I'll send everything flying from now on

297
00:37:32,631 --> 00:37:35,831
センセーション
Sensation

298
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:37,831
愛想振る舞いに
In my pleasant behavior

Into the depths, without a signal

326
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:10,731
Waaah! That was two more songs!

327
00:39:11,031 --> 00:39:14,931
2曲歌いました。いかがだったでしょうか？
I sang two songs. How did you like them?

328
00:39:15,231 --> 00:39:19,631
Hehe. The first song I sang, "DADDY! DADDY! DO!"

329
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:25,331
together with a very, very special guest called Reine Bogel!

330
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:27,731
可愛かったでしょう？ Reine Bogel.
Wasn't she cute? Reine Bogel.

331
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:30,831
Lucu ya? Ih gemoy kenyal-kenyal unyu pengen uh gitu lho!
Cute right? Oh so squishy and adorable, I just want to—you know!

332
00:39:31,131 --> 00:39:35,131
I would want one Reine Bogel in my home. You would want one too, right?

333
00:39:35,431 --> 00:39:40,331
And then... ya gitu deh. Pokoknya for this song, I've always wanted to sing this song...
And then... yeah. Anyway, for this song, I've always wanted to sing this song...

334
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:46,131
...in like an official live, and I finally can do it. So I'm very happy, happy, happy about it!

335
00:39:46,431 --> 00:39:51,631
And for the second song, I sang... apa ya? Wait, it's...
And for the second song, I sang... what was it? Wait, it's...

336
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:57,631
"PaIII.SENSATION"! Yes, I did it! It's such a long title, but a very, very beautiful song.

337
00:39:57,931 --> 00:40:04,331
I personally invited other Holo members...

338
00:40:05,341 --> 00:40:06,641

Lupa ya?
Did you forget?

347
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:24,741
Yo, who taught you that?

348
00:40:24,741 --> 00:40:28,341
Kikiniki, I taught it myself because I'm from Hololive Indonesia.

349
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:29,741
Amayo! Amayo!
Is it so? Is it so?

Emang iya? Emang iya? Really?
Is that so? Is that so? Really?

351
00:40:31,141 --> 00:40:35,141
And I have no memo in my head. No, no, no. Secret, secret memo.

352
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,741
Secret, secret memo.

00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:43,541
So, okay, well...

356
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,141
I don't know if it's okay for her to be here. Is she... is it okay?

357
00:40:46,141 --> 00:40:47,841
Yes, sure!

358
00:40:47,841 --> 00:40:48,741
Really?

359
00:40:48,741 --> 00:40:52,341
Tanjak, tanjak, tanjak, tanjak...

Ya udah deh, ya udah deh. Oke, oke. Wah.
Alright then, alright then. Okay, okay. Wow.

361
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:56,141
Well, okay, well, since she's here anyway, so, what'd you think about the song?

362
00:40:57,841 --> 00:41:00,141
I always love your song choices.

363
00:41:00,141 --> 00:41:03,841
I feel you're a genius of putting the right people together with the right song.

364
00:41:03,841 --> 00:41:07,541
'Cause I also really love your Bitter Choco Decoration cover that you did a long time ago.

365
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:09,841
I always listen to it. Every single week.

366
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:11,841
Yeah, and now you get to do a mature, cool song.

367
00:41:11,841 --> 00:41:15,541
I've always wanted to do it, you know, with like...

368
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:17,841

Ooh, Pavonashi!

Yeah, this is... we've been together so many times now.

374
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:30,841
I know, I was in your live last time, right? My birthday.

375
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:32,841
And I was first in your 3D debut.

376
00:41:32,841 --> 00:41:34,841
Oh, oh, oh! We also sang a spicy song then.

377

Yeah! Spicy!

378
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:39,141

We like it spicy.

00:41:40,841 --> 00:41:42,541
Well, I like it sweet, but, you know.

381
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,841
This is sweet and spicy, it's a good combo, right? Yay!

Oke, terus apa lagi? Kita harus ngomong apa lagi nih?
Okay, what else? What else should we say?

00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:10,141
Yeah, okay. So I... okay, okay.

I want to know your secret, so mysterious

406

何も食べてない、それは内緒
I haven't eaten anything, that's a secret

412
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:31,841
何を聞かれてものらりくらり
No matter what I'm asked, I dodge it smoothly

413
00:43:31,841 --> 00:43:34,541
そう淡々とだけど燦々と
So indifferently, yet brilliantly

414
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:37,541
見えそうで見えない蜜の味
A taste of honey that's almost visible but not

415
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:39,841
ないないない、それもないないない

誰かを好きになることなんて私分からなくてさ
I don't really understand things like falling in love with someone

418
00:43:48,841 --> 00:43:55,841
嘘か本当か知り得ないそんな言葉にまた一人堕ちる
With words that might be lies or truth, someone falls for them again

419
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,841

Even if those eyes and those words are lies, it's a perfect love

00:44:32,841 --> 00:44:35,841
洒落臭い妬み嫉妬なんてないわけない
Cheeky envy and jealousy? There's no way we don't have them

これはネタじゃないからこそ許せない
This isn't a joke, that's why it's unforgivable

433
00:44:55,541 --> 00:44:58,341
弱いとこなんて見せちゃダメダメ
You mustn't show any weak points

434
00:44:58,341 --> 00:45:01,141
知りたいくないとこは見せずに

00:45:11,051 --> 00:45:14,151
隠し切るこの秘密だけは
Except for this one secret to be kept hidden

439
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:17,451
愛してるって嘘で積むキャリア
A career built on the lie of "I love you"

440
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:20,851
これこそ私なりの愛だ
This is my own way of loving

441
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:24,201
流れる汗も綺麗なアクア
Even the flowing sweat is a beautiful aqua

442
00:45:24,551 --> 00:45:27,501
ルビーを隠したこの瞼
These eyelids that hide rubies

443
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:30,901
歌い踊り舞う私はマリア
Singing and dancing, I am Maria

444
00:45:31,151 --> 00:45:34,251
そう嘘はとびきりの愛だ
Yes, lies are the greatest love

445
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:37,351
誰かに愛されたことも
Neither having been loved by someone

446
00:45:37,451 --> 00:45:40,551
誰かのこと愛したことも
Nor having ever loved someone

447
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:43,851
ないそんな私の嘘が
That lie of mine, who has never...

448
00:45:44,151 --> 00:45:47,201
いつか本当になること
...one day coming true

信じてる
I believe in it

450
00:45:48,701 --> 00:45:51,751
いつかきっと全部手に入れる
One day, I'll surely have it all

451
00:45:52,051 --> 00:45:55,151
私はそう欲張りなアイドル
I'm such a greedy idol

452
00:45:55,401 --> 00:45:57,901
等身大でみんなのこと
Exactly as I am,

453
00:45:57,951 --> 00:46:00,001
ちゃんと愛したいから
Because I want to love you all truly

454
00:46:00,151 --> 00:46:02,151
今日も嘘をつくの

514
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:40,561
Jadi kenapa sih pengen nyanyi sama Kobo?
Why do I want to sing with Kobo ya?
So, why did I want to sing with Kobo?
Why do I want to sing with Kobo?

515
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:43,961
Soalnya tuh kebetulan... e...
anak kecil ini di-drop...
Because it just so happens... that
this little kid was dropped...

516
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:47,561
...gitu di depan rumah Tante.
Jadi Tante mengajak dia deh...
...off in front of Auntie's house.
So Auntie invited her...

517
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:52,361
...selagi babysitting sambil diajak nyanyi aja gitu.
...to sing along while I was babysitting her.

518
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:56,861
I wanted to sing with her because, I don't know,
I just felt like... apa ya?
I wanted to sing with her because, I don't know,
I just felt like... how should I say it?

519
00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:01,861
Umm, she was dropped off in front of my door,

520
00:51:01,861 --> 00:51:05,561
so I thought it would be nice to, you know,
babysit while singing with her, I guess.

521
00:51:05,561 --> 00:51:09,561
And yeah, I thought this song fits
both our voice very well,

522
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:13,561
and we're both blue, you know, it's kind of like
the tall blue and the tiny blue,

523
00:51:13,561 --> 00:51:16,561
so it all, it all makes sense. It's nice, right?

524
00:51:16,561 --> 00:51:18,961
I hope you guys enjoyed our performance. Yeah!

525
00:51:19,561 --> 00:51:23,861
And for "Night Dancer", our guest is Calliope!
It's Calli!

526
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:28,561
Calli is someone I've always admired.
She has such a cool voice,

527
00:51:28,561 --> 00:51:32,861
such strong, elegant... I don't know how to say it,

528
00:51:32,861 --> 00:51:36,361
but just, you know, very cool.
Very cool person, very cool vocals.

529
00:51:36,361 --> 00:51:40,861
And this time I wanted to sing something
more chill and elegant...

530
00:51:41,361 --> 00:51:43,861
Not elegant, chill, chill with her.

531
00:51:43,861 --> 00:51:46,361
How was our, how was our dance?

532
00:51:48,161 --> 00:51:52,561
I think, uh, both of us has, you know,
different individual styles,

533
00:51:52,561 --> 00:51:55,761
and it's really interesting to see them
together in a performance.

534
00:51:56,361 --> 00:51:59,361
And then, next up is the...

535
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:02,761
Did anybody guess it?

536
00:52:02,761 --> 00:52:05,361
It's a DJ segment!

537
00:52:05,361 --> 00:52:08,561
次はなんと、DJパートです！
Next is actually a DJ segment!

538
00:52:08,561 --> 00:52:12,761
I'm going to be changing outfits
because I think, I don't know,

539
00:52:12,761 --> 00:52:16,561
maybe if we're going to DJ, maybe we, we need
something more, you know,

540
00:52:16,561 --> 00:52:20,861
more fit for DJ-ing kan bajunya ya?
more fit for DJ-ing, since this outfit isn't, right?

541
00:52:20,861 --> 00:52:23,161
Okay, so I'm going to get changed. Okay?

542
00:52:23,161 --> 00:52:25,861

Believe it and scream it out loud

606
00:57:47,371 --> 00:57:49,471
I don't think I'll miss you anymore

607
00:57:49,571 --> 00:57:51,271
Like I did the day you left

608
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:54,871
There's so many just like you I could use instead

609

This passion's burning but only hurts you in the end

610
00:57:58,671 --> 00:58:01,971
This city's gonna swallow the pain

611

00:58:13,571 --> 00:58:16,971
Till your gaze starts swaying with my body

615
00:58:17,171 --> 00:58:19,371

And race, blast a sonic boom, I'd rather feel like I'm surfing jet waves

626
00:58:56,371 --> 00:58:59,671
Don't need the soundblock, I can make it rain as a hands-up-teaser

I did it all alone,

702
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:12,181
so effortlessly.

703
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,681
I spread my wings

704
01:04:13,681 --> 01:04:15,381

But there's no way I can make it,

709
01:04:21,381 --> 01:04:22,981
dream more than I need to win.

710
01:04:22,981 --> 01:04:24,781
I feel how all these things

711
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:26,381
crumble into little pieces.

712
01:04:26,381 --> 01:04:27,981
I know I gotta soar a little higher,

713
01:04:27,981 --> 01:04:30,781

as long as we got

723
01:04:44,781 --> 01:04:46,181
the strength in ourselves,

724
01:04:46,181 --> 01:04:47,881
we could rise above the pain.

725
01:04:48,381 --> 01:04:49,581
Walking step by step

726
01:04:49,581 --> 01:04:50,981

01:04:59,781 --> 01:05:01,081
Won't let their cruelty

733
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:02,481
stealin' my royalty,

734
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,081
and when the universe works against me

735
01:05:04,081 --> 01:05:05,281
I will just...

736
01:05:05,391 --> 01:05:06,691
Let it go

737
01:05:07,891 --> 01:05:09,391
Let it go

Let it go...

744
01:05:29,391 --> 01:05:30,591
I've been livin' carefree

745
01:05:30,591 --> 01:05:32,591
There's no bitter in the world that could affect me

746
01:05:32,591 --> 01:05:34,391
I spread my wings

747
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:35,691
And let my magic unfold

748
01:05:35,691 --> 01:05:37,191
Not letting it show

749
01:05:37,191 --> 01:05:38,791
Stings but I'm bigger than my feelings

01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:40,691
So that'll be enough

751
01:05:40,891 --> 01:05:42,091

Fate to feel how all these things

754
01:05:44,991 --> 01:05:46,691
Crumble into little pieces

755
01:05:46,691 --> 01:05:49,091
I know I gotta be better than ever

756
01:05:49,091 --> 01:05:51,391

We're stronger than them

766
01:06:09,891 --> 01:06:11,391
Walking step by step

767
01:06:11,391 --> 01:06:12,791
Trusting my own pace

768
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:14,691
Giving me what I deserve to have

769
01:06:14,691 --> 01:06:15,891
Let's go

770
01:06:15,891 --> 01:06:18,091

They'll never bring us down, just believe

772
01:06:21,091 --> 01:06:22,391

878
01:12:07,901 --> 01:12:09,901
いかがだったでしょうか？
How did you like it?

879
01:12:09,901 --> 01:12:14,901
That was performance after performance!

880
01:12:14,901 --> 01:12:19,701
First up, we have the DJ performance. Wow!

881
01:12:19,701 --> 01:12:23,401
For those of you guys who don't know yet,

882
01:12:23,401 --> 01:12:27,901
well, previously I've done a little bit of a 45-minute DJ performance on my channel.

883
01:12:27,901 --> 01:12:29,901
If you guys haven't checked it out, please do check it out.

884
01:12:29,901 --> 01:12:33,401
But you know, some people have been asking, "When is DJ Reine coming back?"

885
01:12:33,401 --> 01:12:37,401
So you know what? I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to include it,

886
01:12:37,401 --> 01:12:40,901
well even though we were on a bit of a time constraint so I had to do something super short.

887
01:12:40,901 --> 01:12:46,901
You know, believe me, it's part of... um, you know, I really, really wanted to include a lot more songs.

888
01:12:46,901 --> 01:12:50,401
It's actually, you know, just a lot of Hololive songs I really, really liked.

889
01:12:50,401 --> 01:12:52,701
I think the songs are like super, super danceable.

890
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:57,901
And did you notice? You know, we had like Holo-ID songs back to back.

891
01:12:57,901 --> 01:13:02,401
I really, I really, really wanted to make it work, and yeah, it did work.

892
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:07,901
You know, so, yeah, maybe next time I will do a longer one, you know,

893
01:13:07,901 --> 01:13:12,401
so I can like fwoo fwoo fwoo fwoo put just a lot more songs.

894
01:13:12,401 --> 01:13:15,401
I thought it's just like fun, you know?

895
01:13:15,401 --> 01:13:20,901
I want to share, share and play all the Hololive songs that I like, and maybe in the future I can do more.

896
01:13:20,901 --> 01:13:25,901
And also, you heard my song "Sip Some Tea", but it's a little bit different, right?

897
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:33,401
The person who did this beautiful remix, thank you so much, Redshift-san!

898
01:13:33,401 --> 01:13:37,901
今回リミックスいただいた方はRedshiftさんです。
The person who provided the remix this time is Redshift-san.

899
01:13:37,901 --> 01:13:41,401
They made it sound really, really cool. Yeah, I really, really like it.

900
01:13:41,401 --> 01:13:44,601
I hope you guys liked it too.

901
01:13:44,601 --> 01:13:50,701
And then my Gen-mates came with me and we sang and performed "Shanghai Honey" together!

902
01:13:50,701 --> 01:13:56,401
I've always wanted to do a super, super, super fun song with Holoro because, you know, it's just a vibe.

903
01:13:56,401 --> 01:13:59,401
It's just a vibe, you know? We're all like super like "woo! yay!"

904
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:04,401
so I thought "Shanghai Honey" was the perfect fit for the three of us.

905
01:14:04,401 --> 01:14:07,401
Yeah, it was really cool, right? And look at these sunglasses.

906
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:09,901
Very nice, right?

907
01:14:09,901 --> 01:14:14,901
Well, today's birthday live concert is about to reach the final song.

908
01:14:14,901 --> 01:14:20,901
But before that, I have two announcements to make.

909
01:14:21,901 --> 01:14:26,901
The first announcement is... Birthday Celebration Merch! Ta-da!

910
01:14:26,901 --> 01:14:32,901
There's limited supplies, so get yours ASAP! And here it is!

911
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:37,401
The merch key visuals are illustrated by Iida Pochi-mama. Yay! So cute, right?

912
01:14:37,401 --> 01:14:40,401
Pochi-mama did the drawing!

913
01:14:40,401 --> 01:14:45,401
And the concept of this merchandise is like, ooh, like neon street performance.

914
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:50,901
And you see the glowing Tatang too right? With the sunglasses. So cute!

915
01:14:50,901 --> 01:14:56,901
And we can take a look at the items one by one. Let's see the goods. Jeng-jeng, what do we have here?

Anyway, it's really cool. So if someone asks, "Hmm, whose fan are you?"

927

Terus kayak... Sroot! Jreng! "Owalah fansnya Reine," gitu!
Then you go... Sroot! Jreng! "Oh, I'm a Reine fan!" like that.

928

You can show your oshi through your shirt.
