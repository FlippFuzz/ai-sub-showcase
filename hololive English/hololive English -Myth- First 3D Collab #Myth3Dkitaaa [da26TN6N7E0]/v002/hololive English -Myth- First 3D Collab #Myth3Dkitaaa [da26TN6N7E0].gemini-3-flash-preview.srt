00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,800
同じ未来を 見ていたい
I want to see the same future

3
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,800
あの夢 手にしたい
I want to grasp that dream

4
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,200
それぞれ 違った 心で
With our each different hearts

5
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,000
走り出そう
Let's start running

6
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,000

9
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,400
どこを見ても真っ暗な場所に芽生えてた
It sprouted in a place where it was pitch black

10
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:30,300
ほんの小さな希望にこの瞳奪われた
This eye was stolen by a just a tiny hope

11
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,800
不安で揺れる心を上手くチューニングして
Tuning well my heart shaking with anxiety

12
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,300
ほんの小さな勇気を振り絞っていたよ
I was squeezing out just a tiny bit of courage

13
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,300
諦めの街 手に手をとって進む
In the city of giving up, let's take each other's hands

14
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:54,000
苦しい時も私は一人じゃないから
Because even in painful times, I am not alone

15
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,300
だからもっと 夢追いかけたい
So I want to chase my dream more

16
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,100
ワクワク止まらない
The excitement won't stop

17
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,100
世界を変えていく
Changing the world

18
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,800
輝き捧げてあげる
I'll give you a brilliance

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
アクセスしてみたい
I want to try to access

20
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,600
後悔なんて想像させない
I won't let you imagine any regrets

21
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,900
それぞれ 違った 心で
With our each different hearts

22
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,300
走り出そう
Let's start running

23
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,000
仮想の空に輝くこの眩しい思いは
This dazzling feeling shining in the virtual sky

24
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,000
見たことのない光をリアルに届けるよ
I'll deliver a never-before-seen light to reality

25
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,400
いつも聞こえるエールはここにキャプチャーして
Capture here the cheers I always hear

26
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,600
また新しい光を探したくなるよ
I'll want to search for new light again

27
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,900
君の笑顔は 保存して進む
Saving your smile, let's move forward

28
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,200
悲しい時に 見返すよ
I'll look back at it when I'm sad

29
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,000
力がわくから
Because strength will well up

30
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,100
胸を張って 夢追いかけたい
With my chest held high, I want to chase my dream

31
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,000
奇跡のストーリー
The story of a miracle

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,800
一緒に作ろう
Let's make together

33
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,600
終わらない夢を
An endless dream

34
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,800
誰一人欠かせない
Not a single person can be missed

35
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,400
愛が待つこの世界
In this world where love waits

36
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,000
それぞれ 違った 心で
With our each different hearts

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,300
彩れ
Color it

38
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,200
フレーズにこの鼓動を鳴らし続けたい
I want to keep ringing this heartbeat in the phrase

39
00:04:52,700 --> 00:05:00,000
終わらない世界に溢れ出す笑顔たち
Smiles overflowing into the endless world

40
00:05:00,033 --> 00:06:10,033
Shiny Smily Story

41
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:04,181
憧れの舞台立ちたい
I want to stand on the stage I've longed for

42
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:07,443
らしく輝きたい
I want to shine like myself

43
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:10,774
時に涙して
Sometimes shedding tears

44
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:13,601
また笑い合いたい
I want to laugh together again

45
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:16,435
同じ未来を見たい
I want to see the same future

46
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:19,447
あの夢手にしたい
I want to grasp that dream

47
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:25,625
踏み出した奇跡の一歩を
That first miraculous step we took forward

48
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,373
息切らせ夢追いかけたい
I want to chase my dreams until I'm breathless

49
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:32,447
ワクワク止まらない
The excitement doesn't stop

50
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:36,594
空を超えていく 世界に見せてあげる
I'll show the world that goes beyond the sky

51
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,262
アクセスしてみない？
Why don't you try to access?

52
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:44,281
後悔なんてここにない
There's no such thing as regret here

53
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:52,033
それぞれ誓った心で進むわ
We'll move forward with the hearts we each pledged

54
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:12,633
We're here!

55
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:13,933
We're here!

56
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,233
We're finally here!

57
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:21,066
I'm so glad we're here. It feels like that sometimes.

58
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:25,833
It's okay, it was still cute. Yes, it was cute.

59
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,766
Hi everybody!

60
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:30,166
Hi everyone!

61
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,933
Myth is here!

62
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,366
We're finally all together in 3D!

63
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:38,866
Welcome everybody...

00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:49,066

00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:32,099

81
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:44,999
Hi hi hi! I'm Takanashi Kiara from Hololive English!

82
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,366
And I forgot to do one thing that I really want us to do!

83
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:51,399
Everybody, I want your hands to go to the middle!

84
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,133
One by one. Let's do our best today! Takanashi Kiara!

85
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:59,033

Ame! せーの... イェーイ！

87
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:08,366
So, everybody, this is our special showcase!

88
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:11,866
We just performed the classic, "Shiny Smily Story"!

89
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,333
How was that? I liked it! It was fun!

90
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:19,499
Nervous, but we made it. It was difficult though...

91
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,033
...practicing that one. We had to practice so many things.

92
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:27,533
I know! But I liked this part! I love this part!

93
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:31,033
We can see the chat! We're reading all your comments.

94
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:33,833
Oh my god, they're so fast! I love the hype!

95
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,433
I love the charms! Kiara... Heart, heart, heart!

96
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,566
Look at the spaceship in the back. Myth spaceship!

97
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:43,033
Oh yeah, look at the space! We're here!

98
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:46,433
Please look at this beautiful stage! Look at the satellite!

99
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:51,133
Whoa, pretty! We have good reception here.

100
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:56,233
Yes, this is the official Hololive English stage...

101
00:08:56,233 --> 00:09:00,033
...as you may have already seen it in our individual showcases.

102
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:05,166
Look, it's an alien! What's over there? Is that Earth?

103
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:10,033
Earth! It's Brazil! Hi! Everybody watching! Konnichiwa!

104
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:15,166
Speaking of our individual showcases, up until this day...

105
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:19,499
...everybody has done them. The first one was Ina!

106
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:22,533
How was it to go first? I was so nervous!

107
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:26,533
I wanted everything to go, you know, perfectly...

108
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:30,499
...so it kind of set a really good mood for everyone.

109
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:33,433
You did great! You did awesome!

110
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:36,499
And then the weekend after, yeah, was our Takamori weekend!

111
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:41,166
Yes! I feel like we rocked the stage!

112
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:47,399
It wasn't me this time, chat. It wasn't me! I'm just saying.

113
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,499
But we did, didn't we? We did! That was amazing!

114
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:56,533
So much fun! And the week after was Gurame!

115
00:09:56,533 --> 00:10:00,033
Hey! It went first, Gurame weekend!

116
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:00,645
Yeah!

117
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:02,145
Yeah!

118
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:04,945
I feel like Gura's showcase was very different from the usual stuff, right?

119
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:07,495
I was a pain in the butts to the studio, but studio team,

120
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:10,245
ありがとうございました、thank you for making it happen! Thank you!
thank you very much, thank you for making it happen! Thank you!

121
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:11,745
Yeah!

122
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,245
Too much math. I hope everybody enjoyed it. Yes, I was a pain.

123
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,245
It's okay though.

124
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:16,845
And then Ame, Ame. You had so much fun!

125
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:17,845
Yeah!

126
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:20,245
It was really fun, I'm glad I was able to do it.

127
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,045
So many balls!

128
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:24,045
But now I'm excited for this stream.

129
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:24,945
Yeah!

130
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:26,545
So excited! We have so many things planned.

131
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:28,145
What are we doing today?

132
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:29,845
Well, well, wait. First...

133
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:31,045
I don't know...

134
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:33,245
This is a special occasion, isn't it?

135
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:35,845
We're in 3D together properly for the first time! Right?

136
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:38,245
Look at these bodies, these beautiful bodies!

137
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:41,245
We sang and danced together! If you guys want to,

138
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:44,245
welcome to use the hashtag up there!

139
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:46,445
#Myth3Dkitaaa!

140
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,145
#Myth3Dkitaaa!

141
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:51,545
Yes! Take screenshots! Take screenshots! Yeah!

142
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:52,545
Take screenshots!

143
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:55,245
Do it, do it! Post them on Twitter or Facebook, I don't know.

144
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:57,245
Take screenshots! Yeah!

145
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:58,545
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

146
00:10:58,545 --> 00:11:03,245
It's not often that we get together like this, so we're gonna make the most out of this occasion with...

147
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,145
We have two games that we'll be playing!

148
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:07,445
Games!

149
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:11,445
And also... you want more like that Shiny Smily Story, right? You want more? Yes, yes, yes!

150
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:14,245
More! More! More!

151
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:19,445
So if you wait until the very end of this stream, you might see more of those performances!

152
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,045
It's worth it!

153
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:25,045
Yeah!

154
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:28,645
Okay! Well, then I think we should start with the first game, shall we?

155
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:31,045
Yeah! Let's go!

156
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:33,545
Game! Game! Game! Game! Game!

157
00:11:33,545 --> 00:11:35,045
What, are we going somewhere?

158
00:11:35,045 --> 00:11:36,145
No.

159
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:36,845
Huh?

160
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:39,145
Yes, we have to go! Game time! No, no, no!

161
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:42,145
Wait, no, this way! This way! Okay, let's go!

162
00:11:42,145 --> 00:11:44,245
This way! Yeah, why not?

163
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:48,045
A game? Not game? Okay. Games!

164
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:54,445
Erh, no. Hey!

165
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:58,245
Why are we here? Why are we here? Welcome!

166
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:00,245
What do you mean welcome? We're not supposed to be here!

167
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:03,445
You guys are under arrest! No!

168
00:14:03,445 --> 00:14:06,045
For the 3D Investigation Redux!

169
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:12,045
The Investigation 3D Redux / 聞き取り調査ショー
The Investigation 3D Redux / Inquiry Investigation Show

170
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,145
What? What investigation?

171
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:12,445
If there's a logo that means it was actually planned. I didn't know about this!

172
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:15,845
I didn't know about this either! What's going on?

173
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:21,045
All right, well, I need to investigate all of you closely, because now we're in 3D...

174
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:23,045
...and now we can't hide anything!

175
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:25,845
Did you do something? That wasn't supposed to be a game!

176
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:28,845
No! No! No! No!

177
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:31,045
Over against the wall! You're the first in the dock!

178
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:33,045
What... what did I do?

179
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:35,045
What did you do? What did you do?

180
00:14:35,045 --> 00:14:37,445
The crimes! There's something here. Hold on, I gotta look closely.

181
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:41,445
もしもし、メガネ... [mumbling].
Moshi moshi, megane... [mumbling].

182
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:43,045
Hey! Oh!

183
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:45,045
Oh! Now you want to look closely?

184
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:48,045
Yeah, yeah, I heard you got an update or something.

185
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:51,045
Something changed recently. No, I have to protect myself.

186
00:14:51,045 --> 00:14:53,045
So let me just get something to protect myself.

187
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:55,645
Oh! You guys remember seeing Kiara's behind?

188
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,445
On guard! Ha! Ah!

189
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:59,845
She has a weapon! What's with the sword?

190
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:01,257
No, no, no, no, that's fake.

191
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:02,557
That's... that's not real. It's optical.

192
00:15:05,557 --> 00:15:07,857
How do I turn around? Turn around! Look at that, look at that.

193
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:08,557
Damn!

194
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:10,057
Oh my god!

195
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:13,057
I'm not hiding any crimes in here, oh my goodness.

196
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:15,557
You got a permit for that, don't you?

197
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:18,057
Yeah, do you have a permit for this, ma'am?

198
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:20,557
Kiara's the one that's gonna get this channel banned.

199
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:22,057
No, no, no, no! Ame!

200
00:15:22,057 --> 00:15:24,557
I need to archive this so we'll take a picture of the front first.

201
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:28,557
Okay, okay. All right.

202
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:30,557
A photo for all the crimes you've committed. All right, side profile.

203
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:37,057
Okay, enough, enough. The back?

204
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:38,057
Yes, the back!

205
00:15:38,057 --> 00:15:41,057
All right, all right, all right. Another close look.

206
00:15:43,057 --> 00:15:45,057
Okay, okay, all right, get out.

207
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:47,057
All right, you got it, you got it. Good angle.

208
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:48,557
Kikiriki!

209
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:51,557
Okay, okay, thank you for the photoshoot.

210
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:54,057
Who's next? The small one. You.

211
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:56,057
The small short one. That's you.

212
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:59,057
Go shorty, go shorty. That's you, Shark. Get in there.

213
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:01,057
Who, me? わたし？
Who, me? Me?

214
00:16:01,057 --> 00:16:04,557
She definitely has crimes on her. You've committed many crimes.

215
00:16:04,557 --> 00:16:05,557
Me?

216
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:07,557
Yeah, being too short. That's what it is.

217
00:16:07,557 --> 00:16:09,057
What you talking about, shorty?

218
00:16:09,057 --> 00:16:12,057
Short stack, yeah you want to go? I'm taller than you!

219
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:13,557
You want to go?

220
00:16:19,557 --> 00:16:21,057
Pretty good.

221
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:22,557
All right, let me have a closer look at that thing.

222
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:24,057
It's in violation.

223
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:25,557
What thing? What violation?

224
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:27,557
That thing back there. It's a kind of smelly.

225
00:16:27,557 --> 00:16:29,057
Smelly!

226
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,057
It's not smelly!

227
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:37,057
All right, let me... I'm going to take a picture of this.

228
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:39,057
But let's take a picture of the front first.

229
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:40,057
Okay, front.

230
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:41,557
Oh, my mugshot, okay.

231
00:16:41,557 --> 00:16:43,057
Yeah, mugshot time.

232
00:16:45,557 --> 00:16:47,557
All right, side profile. Turn please.

233
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:49,057
She looks guilty.

234
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:50,057
Guilty!

235
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:51,557
Guilty of crimes.

236
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:53,057
Guilty of committing more than one!

237
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:54,057
Too cute.

238
00:16:54,057 --> 00:16:56,557
Vicious. Possibly.

239
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,557
All right, now stay right here. All right.

240
00:16:58,557 --> 00:17:01,057
Calliope Mori, come into the frame, please.

241
00:17:01,057 --> 00:17:04,057
Wait, Calliope Mori? Why am I involved in this? I did nothing.

242
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:07,557
Is she a lost child? I need to compare heights, size.

243
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:09,057
Oh, wow, sorry about that.

244
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:11,557
Kind of morphed into you for a minute there.

245
00:17:11,557 --> 00:17:15,057
Look at that height difference! Wow! Over-proves!

246
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:20,057
All right, all right, Shark, get out of here.

247
00:17:20,057 --> 00:17:21,557
All right, see you later guys.

248
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:22,557
Out of the frame. I gotta take a nap.

249
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:24,557
You've committed crimes.

250
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:26,057
What did I do?

251
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:27,557
Every Calli crime! Oh yeah!

252
00:17:28,557 --> 00:17:31,057
Well, I guess I did kill everyone on the planet but...

253
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:32,057
So you admit to it!

254
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:34,557
Okay, but that's my job, okay?

255
00:17:34,557 --> 00:17:37,557
All right, let me inspect around here. Excuse me.

256
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,557
Oh! These shoes, these are nice. What are you...

257
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:40,557
What are you doing with these?

258
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:44,057
What size are these bad boys? Like dogs are barking!

259
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:45,557
The doggy's barking!

260
00:17:45,557 --> 00:17:47,557
Step on me! Step on me!

261
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:49,557
No, Kiara, please! I didn't do anything.

262
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:51,557
All right, you did something. You're being booked.

263
00:17:51,557 --> 00:17:53,057
And we're gonna take your picture first.

264
00:17:53,057 --> 00:17:54,557
So face the front please.

265
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:56,557
I'm the most innocent one here.

266
00:17:57,557 --> 00:17:59,057
I think she has a weapon. Is it a weapon?

267
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,057
No weapon. I didn't bring it today.

268
00:18:01,057 --> 00:18:04,557
Guilty! Guilty for not having eyes! I caught her! Look at that!

269
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:07,557
All right, the side profile.

270
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:09,557
All right, all right, get out of here. You're going downtown.

271
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:11,257
It's an act, it's all an act!

272
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,057
Okay, last.

273
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:15,557
The most offensive crimes against humanity.

274
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:19,557
Ina-san! Your turn! Inanis, please! Face the front.

275
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,557
She's definitely the most guilty. Look at that face.

276
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:25,557
Wait, what? I'm innocent. Really!

277
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:30,057
Really? That's why you're booked because too many puns! Your crime!

278
00:18:30,057 --> 00:18:34,557
Ah, but you guys enjoyed it! I know you guys enjoyed it!

279
00:18:34,557 --> 00:18:36,057
Yeah, yeah.

280
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:38,057
Also she's not giving out enough cookies.

281
00:18:38,057 --> 00:18:40,057
She promises cookies and she doesn't give them.

282
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:41,557
I want cookies!

283
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:43,557
It's rough times, okay? I can't... I can't make them all.

284
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:44,557
She gave us cake!

285
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:47,057
Are you hiding something back here? Let me pat you down.

286
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:49,057
Is there something there? Let me see.

287
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:51,557
Okay, wait, every... for a second... はずかしい...
Okay, wait, every... for a second... It's embarrassing...

288
00:18:51,557 --> 00:18:54,057
What's going on? Oh, wait, what's that?

289
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:56,057
Oh my god!

290
00:18:56,057 --> 00:18:58,057
Tentacles! They're coming out!

291
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:11,057
Oh, I got it, I feel yucky.

292
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:13,057
I'm innocent. Nothing wrong.

293
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:14,557
Put that away!

294
00:19:14,557 --> 00:19:16,057
Okay, okay. はずかしい...
Okay, okay. It's embarrassing...

295
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:18,557
That's dangerous! So dangerous!

296
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,557
My crime...

297
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:22,557
I almost lost my breath because she's so cute.

298
00:19:22,557 --> 00:19:24,057
Get back!

299
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:26,557
All right, all right, get her! Put them away!

300
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:28,057
Oh, no! Put them away!

301
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:31,057
Get them away! Don't get too close!

302
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:33,057
Maybe close your eyes.

303
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:36,557
Oh, they're fine now. She looks normal.

304
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:39,057
見ちゃだめ！ Are we good?
Don't look! Are we good?

305
00:19:39,057 --> 00:19:42,057
Are they gone? Are they gone?

306
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,057
They... okay.

307
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,057
All right, that feels... Ina's back.

308
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:48,057
Okay, they're gone.

309
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:51,057
All right, that was disgusting. Oh, I'm scared.

310
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,057
Oh my!

311
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,057
All right, we're gonna take your picture. Come on.

312
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:56,557
It's okay. I'll free you after this, I swear, I swear.

313
00:19:56,557 --> 00:19:58,557
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. That's cruel.

314
00:19:58,557 --> 00:19:59,557
あ、チュ！
Ah, chu!

315
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:00,057
All right, side profile please.

316
00:20:03,189 --> 00:20:05,419
All right, I need to test something for science. Give me a moment.

317
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:07,569
Let me put my 虫眼鏡 away.
Let me put my magnifying glass away.

318
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:08,569
Hic!

319
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:09,169
Okay.

320
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,569
What are you gonna do? Oh boy.

321
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,269
Hic, hic, hic, hic, chat!

322
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:14,369
What is that?

323
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:16,369
Uh, I need to do a scientific dunk.

324
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:20,369
No, Ina, stay... I need you to stay still.

325
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:21,869
I'm trying!

326
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:23,469
It's not gonna work. It's not gonna work.

327
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:26,169
Gonna do a dunk... Hyah!

328
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:29,569
One more try! All right, one more, one more.

329
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:32,469
Do the dunk! Slam dunk!

330
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:34,669
She shoots... she scores!

331
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:41,269
Very nice! Okay, okay.

332
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:43,769
All right, that concludes the investigation. I'll free you for now.

333
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:45,369
No it doesn't!

334
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:46,469
Not yet! We have one more left!

335
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:47,869
We have to investigate her!

336
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:49,069
I don't think so!

337
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:51,569
You're not getting away from us!

338
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:54,069
You're not getting away from us!

339
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:55,769
Wait! Oh! Be careful, be careful.

340
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,669
Come here! Get her! Get her!

341
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:03,269
Take it away! Take it away!

342
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:06,069
I'm going to be the authority here! Take the 虫眼鏡!
I'm going to be the authority here! Take the magnifying glass!

343
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:08,569
No! I have the camera! You can't do it like this!

344
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,569
We gotta keep it professional.

345
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,369
We have to investigate her professionally.

346
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:13,469
Okay, fine, fine.

347
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:14,369
Tada!

348
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:15,369
Where'd you guys get those?

349
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:18,569
Amazon! Amazon! Amazon!

350
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:21,069
Let me look at you. You guys got into my stash?

351
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:23,569
Let's see. Hmm... Detective Watson, what are you doing over there?

352
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:25,169
I've committed no crimes.

353
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,569
What are those? Suspicious! Suspicious!

354
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:28,569
You committed many crimes. 30 seconds ago.

355
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:30,069
She's a liar.

356
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:32,469
なるほど。
I see.

357
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:33,869
Why don't we arrest you?

358
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:35,369
What are you guys looking at? Interesting.

359
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:37,369
Oh, nice shoes! They're pretty good.

360
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:39,869
Yeah, they're so shiny. Detective steppers.

361
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,569
Don't hide! Don't hide! What's in there?

362
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,369
What are you hiding under the cape?

363
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:46,469
She's hiding the Watson concoction!

364
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:48,369
No! There's nothing there. They can't see it.

365
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:50,069
I can't see it. But they wish they could.

366
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:54,069
Well, we should take some mugshots really quickly.

367
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:55,769
Yeah, let's take some photos.

368
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:57,669
Get against the wall, yellow one! Against the wall!

369
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:00,569
Oh, she's guilty! Look at that face!

370
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:04,569
Look at the face! Sideways! What are we booking her for, chat?

371
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:05,469
All right.

372
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:07,469
And the side! I would never commit a crime.

373
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:11,069
Investigating us without a warrant. I think we have illegal substances.

374
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:12,769
Okay, what's Watson concoction, of course?

375
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:15,569
Well, we'll have this... this footage investigated later in the back.

376
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:21,069
But for now, we have to actually go by the script, okay? Enough of this.

377
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:22,469
Go by the script. Okay, fine.

378
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:26,569
We have some games prepared, so let's do this! All right, let's go!

379
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:28,569
Get rid of those. Okay, I'll put this back in the 虫眼鏡 stand.
Get rid of those. Okay, I'll put this back in the magnifying glass stand.

380
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:32,569
Yeah, put those back where you found them, okay? Okay.

381
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:33,469
I need those.

382
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:36,569
So, everybody! Are you ready for some fun?

383
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:40,069
Yes! Sure! I'm up for anything!

384
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:43,769
The first game that we're playing today is...

385
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:46,569
Telephone Charades!

386
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:50,069
Telephone Charades / ジェスチャー伝言ゲーム
Telephone Charades

387
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:56,369
Well, since we're here in the highest quality of 3D, we want to show it off to you guys with this special game.

388
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:01,069
I will explain the rules to you guys.

389
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:07,369
Okay. Rules, rules, rules. I love rules. Rules are my favorite.

390
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:12,569
Right, right. So, the first person... we're gonna stand in a line, okay?

391
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:13,469
Standing in a line.

392
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:22,069
And the first person on the either the most right-hand side or the most left-hand side will get a clue that everybody else doesn't get to see.

393
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,069
We have to close our eyes, yes.

394
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:31,069
And then the person taps on the next person's shoulder, and they may open their eyes and they act out...

395
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:33,069
...well, for example, if Calli's first...

396
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:34,569
...she will act out to the other person. Yes.

397
00:23:35,469 --> 00:23:41,069
And then, we only have 30 seconds for that, and there's no talking allowed!

398
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:44,269
So, how will that go? I wonder. You gotta do your best to show everything with your body.

399
00:23:44,469 --> 00:23:45,369
Okay.

400
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:50,369
So we'll go by the order of: Calli, please, at the right over there, you're perfectly in the spot.

401
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:54,069
And then Ame, please. Okay.

402
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,569
Then Ina. That's me.

403
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:58,569
Gura. Gura-gura-gura-gura.

404
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:04,569
And then it will be me! Let's see how that goes! Okay.

405
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:12,569
All right, everybody close your eyes! Okay, let's start! No looking! Don't look, don't look, don't look!

406
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:14,369
For real, don't look! Show it to me.

407
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:19,069
Answer: Octopus / タコ
Answer: Octopus

408
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:19,469
Oh boy... This is going to be interesting. Got it.

409
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,069
No talking! 30 seconds. Ready? Can I turn around? Can I turn?

410
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:24,069
I think so! All right, Ame. Oh, okay.

411
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:28,069
Check this out. What the... what is that supposed to be?

412
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:36,569
Oh, okay, okay. Oh, that makes... okay.

413
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:41,069
I think I'm ready. I think I'm ready.

414
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:42,569
Okay. Can I look? Yeah, Ina look.

415
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:46,569
Do your best! がんばれ, がんばれ! Oh yeah!
Do your best! Do your best! Oh yeah!

416
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:50,569
Very nice! Yeah, keep it up! Oh, I think I get it!

417
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,569
You ready to go on? I don't know!

418
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:59,569
I'm just doing what she did! Okay, okay, okay. Gura!

419
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,081
Put your back into it, Ina!

420
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:02,581
Put your back into it!

421
00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:04,581
What is happening?!

422
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:08,081
I don't know what's happening!

423
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:10,081
You gotta really move with it.

424
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:12,081
Okay. Okay.

425
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:12,781
You got it?

426
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:13,581
You got it.

427
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:14,581
Ina, nice legs.

428
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:15,581
Hi!

429
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:16,581
Hi!

430
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:18,081
Oh, pretty good.

431
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,581
Okay, pretty good.

432
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,581
Okay, pretty good.

433
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:21,081
Those moves!

434
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:22,581
Oh, okay!

435
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:24,081
It's moving!

436
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:26,581
Wow, wow, wow!

437
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:26,581
Okay.

438
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:30,081
I feel things I've never felt before.

439
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:31,581
Can I stop now?

440
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:32,581
Oh yeah, you can stop.

441
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:33,581
Yeah, you can stop.

442
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:37,081
Well, I-I would say that is a mating dance?
Well, I would say that is a mating dance?

443
00:25:37,081 --> 00:25:38,281
Are you serious?

444
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:39,081
Yes.

445
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:42,581
What part of that looked anything like a mating dance?

446
00:25:42,581 --> 00:25:45,081
It was a mating dance! Does it attract you?

447
00:25:45,081 --> 00:25:48,081
Was my... was I...

448
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:49,581
What did you think it was, Gura?

449
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,081
What do you think, Gura?

450
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:53,081
Yeah, what did you think it was?

451
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:57,081
I thought it was... interpretive dance.

452
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:58,081
Oh, okay.

453
00:25:58,081 --> 00:25:59,081
She doesn't know either!

454
00:25:59,081 --> 00:26:02,581
Well, okay, I thought it was swimming.

455
00:26:02,581 --> 00:26:04,581
That's what I thought.

456
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:07,581
With the arms more like drowning.

457
00:26:07,581 --> 00:26:10,581
But then she did this, I was like "what's that"?

458
00:26:10,581 --> 00:26:11,881
I was talented!

459
00:26:11,881 --> 00:26:13,581
I interpreted it!

460
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:16,581
Okay, okay. So yeah. Well, shall we look at the real...

461
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:18,081
The real answer!

462
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:19,081
The answer is...

463
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:21,081
Octopus!

464
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,581
Octopus!

465
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:35,081
Answer: Octopus / タコ
Answer: Octopus

466
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:27,081
You should've seen the way I was moving my legs. It was insane.

467
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:28,581
I see it now, I see it now.

468
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:30,081
Maybe...

469
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:32,581
It's difficult with only four limbs, alright?

470
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:33,581
No, it's not!

471
00:26:33,581 --> 00:26:34,581
Shut up, Ina!

472
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:37,081
I did my best out there! Only four limbs!

473
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:40,581
Well, okay, okay. That was okay, I guess, but let's do a second round, alright?

474
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:44,081
We can try again! We'll switch up the order, so who wants to go first?

475
00:26:44,081 --> 00:26:45,581
I'll go first! I'll go first!

476
00:26:45,581 --> 00:26:47,081
Okay!

477
00:26:47,081 --> 00:26:50,081
I'll fix what you couldn't do, Takanashi.

478
00:26:50,081 --> 00:26:51,581
I don't want to be last!

479
00:26:51,581 --> 00:26:53,081
I'll be second-to-last!

480
00:26:51,581 --> 00:26:53,081
Oi, oi, oi!

481
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:55,081
I'll be after her.

482
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:57,081
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

483
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:57,081
Who's in the front?

484
00:26:57,081 --> 00:26:58,581
No, you be like...

485
00:26:58,581 --> 00:27:00,581
Give me a sec, I'm at a FamilyMart.

486
00:27:00,581 --> 00:27:05,081
The next one, however, will be more like a situation rather than an animal or whatever.

487
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:10,081
And you guys will not see the answer either until the end, so have fun guessing with us, alright?

488
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:11,581
Everybody! Chat, get it right!

489
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:13,581
Close your eyes!

490
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:15,581
I'm trusting you, Ina! I'm trusting you!

491
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:18,581
Do your best, Ina. I'm counting on you.

492
00:27:18,581 --> 00:27:20,081
Ah, wait.

493
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:22,581
I think I got it. I think I got it.

494
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:24,581
Okay, okay. You can turn around, Calli.

495
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:27,081
Okay! What do we got? Not talking...

496
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:35,081
Oh, what is it this time? Oh, got it!

497
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:38,081
That's kind of cute! Okay, aww.

498
00:27:38,081 --> 00:27:39,581
Wow, wow! Open your eyes!

499
00:27:39,581 --> 00:27:40,581
Hi!

500
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:45,581
Ohhh! I mean, you were making noises though.

501
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,581
I'll forgive that one since it's not talking.

502
00:27:48,581 --> 00:27:50,581
I mean, okay! Can I turn around?

503
00:27:54,081 --> 00:27:55,581
Hi! Hello!

504
00:27:55,581 --> 00:27:57,081
Hello!

505
00:27:57,081 --> 00:28:01,081
What are you doing to me? Is that it?

506
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:05,581
Oh, that's cute! That's cute! Okay, alright.

507
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:09,581
I think Gura's gonna guess it! Alright.

508
00:28:13,581 --> 00:28:17,081
Oh, that's easy! That's easy!

509
00:28:17,081 --> 00:28:20,081
Okay, yeah, it seems easy! One of us is a genius!

510
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:22,581
Hmm-mmm-mmm, sleepy. Sleeping? Taking a nap?

511
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:23,581
Okay.

512
00:28:25,081 --> 00:28:28,081
Oh! There's a little more to it!

513
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:32,081
There's a little more to it! Who messed up?

514
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:36,581
Well, I guess it was sleeping on someone's shoulder, right?

515
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,081
That's what I thought!

516
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:39,581
Because that's a situation!

517
00:28:39,581 --> 00:28:42,581
I didn't know it was supposed to be on a shoulder!

518
00:28:42,581 --> 00:28:45,581
That's why I was so close to you!

519
00:28:45,581 --> 00:28:47,081
Yeah, yeah.

520
00:28:47,081 --> 00:28:48,581
Okay, well, okay, so the correct one is...

521
00:28:48,581 --> 00:28:51,081
Falling asleep on someone's shoulder!

522
00:28:48,581 --> 00:29:05,081
Answer: falling asleep on someone's shoulder / 人の肩で寝る
Answer: falling asleep on someone's shoulder

523
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:53,581
Aww! I saw it in chat!

524
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:56,581
That was so easy! We did so well!

525
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:59,581
See? See? I told you, chat! Not bad, right?

526
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:01,581
We didn't mess up. Okay, so we got both wrong.

527
00:29:01,581 --> 00:29:05,081
Hmm, shoot. Now, on which shoulder would you like to sleep tonight?

528
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:08,581
Which shoulder? Which shoulder would you like to sleep on?

529
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,581
I got plenty!

530
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:12,581
Isn't it nice to sleep on somebody's shoulder?

531
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:17,581
Anytime, Calli.

532
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:19,581
I got two pillows right here.

533
00:29:19,581 --> 00:29:20,581
Ina...

534
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:21,581
Right here.

535
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:25,581
Comfortable. Pretty comfortable.

536
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:28,081
It's pretty much a blanket.

537
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:32,581
You don't want to sleep on Gura's hat? It's gonna be really soft.

538
00:29:33,581 --> 00:29:37,081
Just like a thin outside... Stop being cute!

539
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:41,081
That thing is hard and squishy. What are you talking about?

540
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:42,581
It's squishy!

541
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:43,581
That fits firm.

542
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:47,081
Well, good try, everybody! That was fun! Yay!

543
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:51,081
Yeah! We didn't get it in the end, but it was pretty close the second one.

544
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:54,081
Yeah! I would say half correct. We have 0.5 points.

545
00:29:54,081 --> 00:29:56,581
Not bad. Pretty good.

546
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,893
Hey, did you guys enjoy it in the chat?

547
00:30:01,893 --> 00:30:03,593
Did you guys have a good time? Yeah?

548
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,193
Was it alright?

549
00:30:05,193 --> 00:30:06,893
Yeah, well that was insane.

550
00:30:06,893 --> 00:30:08,593
Anyone saying no?

551
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:11,293
I will find you, don't you dare.

552
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:15,093
You, and you, and you. I'm kidding.

553
00:30:15,593 --> 00:30:18,593
Well, with that, I think we're gonna play

554
00:30:18,593 --> 00:30:21,093
the next game right away because we're excited!

555
00:30:21,093 --> 00:30:22,593
Oh my god!

556
00:30:22,593 --> 00:30:24,093
Yay!

557
00:30:24,093 --> 00:30:25,593
Where are we going? Where are we going?

558
00:30:25,593 --> 00:30:27,593
Games, games, games!

559
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:30,093
For the next game, we're gonna go to another room though!

560
00:30:30,093 --> 00:30:31,593
Bye guys!

561
00:30:31,593 --> 00:30:33,593
See you in the next room!

562
00:30:33,593 --> 00:30:35,593
New room! New room! Exciting!

563
00:30:35,593 --> 00:30:37,093
I'm coming as well!

564
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:39,093
Let's go, team! Goodbye!

565
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:22,593
Ta-da-da-da!

566
00:32:22,593 --> 00:32:24,093
Ohhh!

567
00:32:24,093 --> 00:32:26,593
I know this place!

568
00:32:26,593 --> 00:32:28,093
Tatami!

569
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:30,093
It's Fubuki-senpai's room!

570
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:32,093
Ah, so fun, so fun!

571
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:34,093
Wow, it's nice in here!

572
00:32:34,093 --> 00:32:35,593
Mmm, yummy!

573
00:32:35,593 --> 00:32:38,093
Welcome back everybody, thank you for waiting.

574
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:40,593
Yes, this place, you got it right,

575
00:32:40,593 --> 00:32:43,093
it's Fubuki-senpai's place.

576
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:45,093
Thank you for lending it to us!

577
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:47,093
Wait a minute, is this her persona?

578
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:51,093
No, no, no, no. That's Orona, that's Orona.

579
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:52,593
Cute!

580
00:32:52,593 --> 00:32:55,593
She's currently out buying milk,

581
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:57,593
she'll be back soon probably.

582
00:32:57,593 --> 00:32:59,593
I hope she comes back.

583
00:32:59,593 --> 00:33:02,093
So since it is a Japanese inspired room,

584
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:05,093
the game of course is also Japanese inspired.

585
00:33:05,093 --> 00:33:08,093
But before we get started with that,

586
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:10,593
I want to hear some episodes from you guys!

587
00:33:10,593 --> 00:33:12,093
Oh, oh?

588
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:15,093
Because we are all now together in Japan.

589
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,593
Some of us for the first time,

590
00:33:17,593 --> 00:33:20,093
some of us maybe for the second time,

591
00:33:20,093 --> 00:33:23,093
some of us like for the hundredth time.

592
00:33:23,093 --> 00:33:26,593
But I think we all kind of felt

593
00:33:26,593 --> 00:33:28,093
some kind of culture shock, right, until now?

594
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:31,093
That's true, surely we all have something like that.

595
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,093
Japan is very different.

596
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:34,593
So, anybody got something?

597
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:36,593
Oh, I do! I do!

598
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:39,093
Sometimes I gotta take a taxi, for various reasons.

599
00:33:39,093 --> 00:33:42,093
Whenever I do though, the taxi dude is always like...

600
00:33:42,093 --> 00:33:44,593
“Okay, so what's our route?”

601
00:33:44,593 --> 00:33:47,093
I'm like “Huh? What do you mean what's our route?

602
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:49,593
I'm gonna leave it up to you.”

603
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:52,093
He's like “Well, we'll take this street,

604
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:55,093
and then we'll take this highway, is that okay?”

605
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:56,593
Yeah, that's fine.

606
00:33:56,593 --> 00:33:59,093
“And then when you get off, we'll take this street,

607
00:33:59,093 --> 00:34:02,093
but this street is a little far,

608
00:34:02,093 --> 00:34:04,593
so we're gonna take this street instead. It's a shortcut.

609
00:34:04,593 --> 00:34:06,093
Is that okay?”

610
00:34:06,093 --> 00:34:08,593
Yeah, just drive the car, it's cool, it's cool.

611
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:10,593
He's trying to be polite.

612
00:34:10,593 --> 00:34:13,593
I understand it, it's just that I guess maybe foreigners

613
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,093
are just so go-go-go, you know,

614
00:34:16,093 --> 00:34:18,593
we don't usually care how we get there, it doesn't matter.

615
00:34:18,593 --> 00:34:21,093
Speaking of taxis, you know how,

616
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:24,093
you know when you try to open the door for the taxi

617
00:34:24,093 --> 00:34:26,593
because normally you do that in my country?

618
00:34:26,593 --> 00:34:29,093
They say like “No, no, please don't touch it,

619
00:34:29,093 --> 00:34:31,093
we're opening it automatically.”

620
00:34:31,093 --> 00:34:33,593
So please stop, don't touch!

621
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:36,593
Also when you want to get out, same thing,

622
00:34:36,593 --> 00:34:38,093
it always opens automatically.

623
00:34:38,093 --> 00:34:39,593
So I'm like “Oh, okay.”

624
00:34:39,593 --> 00:34:41,593
I got used to it now, but...

625
00:34:41,593 --> 00:34:44,593
It's nice when you have a lot of stuff in your hands though,

626
00:34:44,593 --> 00:34:46,593
because you don't have to touch the door.

627
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:48,093
That's true, that's true. Very free.

628
00:34:48,593 --> 00:34:50,593
Oh the trains here are insane! They're crazy!

629
00:34:50,593 --> 00:34:52,593
電車はすごい！
The trains are amazing!

630
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:56,093
All the train stations are like dungeons, they're crazy.

631
00:34:56,093 --> 00:34:58,593
Oh yeah, lots of stairs. I get lost.

632
00:34:58,593 --> 00:35:00,093
Yeah, you get lost a lot.

633
00:35:00,105 --> 00:35:01,605
Oh yeah, you try to...

634
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:03,105
...it was like... and then suddenly you're like...

635
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:07,605
I remember that one time you walked too far ahead...

636
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,105
...and we were like, "Wait!"

637
00:35:09,205 --> 00:35:11,105
Oh yeah, you didn't even check!

638
00:35:11,205 --> 00:35:13,105
We walk in one line a lot.

639
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:14,605
You gotta keep up there!

640
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:16,605
I was like, "Oh no, I think the express is leaving!"

641
00:35:16,705 --> 00:35:18,105
You gotta keep up.

642
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:20,605
Speaking of trains, another thing I noticed with the trains is that...

643
00:35:20,705 --> 00:35:23,105
...in my country everybody's like loud...

644
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:26,605
...and they all walk and they scream and listen to music.

645
00:35:26,705 --> 00:35:28,205
But in Japan, they're all quiet...

646
00:35:28,305 --> 00:35:29,605
...and they're like, they're sleeping.

647
00:35:29,705 --> 00:35:30,605
Yes.

648
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:31,605
Yeah, it's really, really quiet.

649
00:35:32,105 --> 00:35:33,605
Right? I'm almost scared to talk.

650
00:35:34,105 --> 00:35:36,105
And how do people not hold onto the things?

651
00:35:36,205 --> 00:35:38,105
They just stand there on their own power stance.

652
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:39,605
Right? Power stance.

653
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:44,105
Well, I can't really. I wish I could hold onto Ina.

654
00:35:44,205 --> 00:35:45,105
Yeah.

655
00:35:45,205 --> 00:35:46,605
Surfing practice.

656
00:35:46,705 --> 00:35:48,105
Hold onto me, Gura. I got you!

657
00:35:49,205 --> 00:35:51,105
Any other episodes?

658
00:35:53,105 --> 00:35:54,605
Oh, there's lots of...

659
00:35:54,705 --> 00:35:57,105
...there's lots of text everywhere, like there's lots of advertisements and signs.

660
00:35:57,205 --> 00:36:00,105
And it's crazy, and it's fun to test to see what I can and cannot read.

661
00:36:00,205 --> 00:36:03,105
I wish I could read all of it because I want to know what it says.

662
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:05,605
It's very overwhelming though, right?

663
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,605
It is, but it's also fun because it's something I've never experienced.

664
00:36:09,205 --> 00:36:12,105
I'm sorry, I took her on one of her first days...

665
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:14,605
...I took her to the most overwhelming stores ever.

666
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:18,605
Bic Camera and Don Quijote and the music!

667
00:36:19,205 --> 00:36:21,105
I was also following you like a baby chicken.

668
00:36:21,205 --> 00:36:23,105
Yeah.

669
00:36:23,205 --> 00:36:26,105
I felt like a happy chicken mother, I guess.

670
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:27,605
Anyone else?

671
00:36:27,705 --> 00:36:29,605
Oh, well, I have one!

672
00:36:30,205 --> 00:36:33,105
I mean, I've tried not to, but I ordered a lot of Uber Eats while I was here.

673
00:36:33,205 --> 00:36:36,605
And realized every time I'm like... they ping-pong on my door...

674
00:36:37,105 --> 00:36:40,105
...and like open the door for them, they like... do a little bow.

675
00:36:40,205 --> 00:36:44,105
I'm just like, "Oh, they're so polite, even like... even I'm not in front of them."

676
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:47,105
And like, you know, they usually have like a little message they can send...

677
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,105
...when they say like, "Thanks for the tip!"

678
00:36:50,205 --> 00:36:54,105
Like, everyone says "Thanks for the tip!" and I'm just like, "I've never seen this before!"

679
00:36:54,205 --> 00:36:55,605
They are so polite!

680
00:36:55,705 --> 00:36:57,105
Every time, yeah. Sugoi!
Every time, yeah. Amazing!

681
00:36:58,205 --> 00:36:59,605
Heh heh, Japan.

682
00:36:59,705 --> 00:37:04,105
Well, those are some nice stories you got for me. Thank you very much.

683
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:08,105
But now, we're gonna play a game to hopefully learn even more about Japanese culture.

684
00:37:08,205 --> 00:37:11,105
So, the game's name is... what's it called?

685
00:37:11,205 --> 00:37:13,605
What is it called, Kiara? Ame, help her out!

686
00:37:13,705 --> 00:37:15,105
It's not written there anymore!

687
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:17,605
Queen of... Queen of Japan... Tada!

688
00:37:19,105 --> 00:37:24,105
日本の作法王決定戦
Queen of Japanese Etiquette

689
00:37:19,105 --> 00:37:24,105
Queen of Japanese Etiquette!

690
00:37:24,205 --> 00:37:26,605
Yatta! So, the rules are...
Hooray! So, the rules are...

691
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:30,105
...we get one theme, one situation or something like that...

692
00:37:30,205 --> 00:37:34,105
...and then with the theme comes four different choices...

693
00:37:34,205 --> 00:37:37,105
...that could be either wrong or correct. There's one wrong one.

694
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:40,605
And we'll have them be acted out by...

695
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:42,605
Who's really good at acting? Everyone!

696
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:45,105
We can all act! How about we all do it?

697
00:37:45,205 --> 00:37:47,605
Okay, okay. Everyone together!

698
00:37:48,205 --> 00:37:51,105
And then, once we're done acting, we'll decide together...

699
00:37:51,205 --> 00:37:54,105
...we'll put our heads together and we'll think which one is wrong.

700
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,605
Alright! So, YouTube chat, let's go, let's go!

701
00:37:57,105 --> 00:37:59,105
Yeah, you can guess too, chat!

702
00:37:59,205 --> 00:38:00,605
First choice, first theme is... tada!

703
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:03,105
日常生活
Daily Life

704
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:03,105
Daily Life! Slice of Life!

705
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:06,105
Slice of life. Nichijou Seikatsu. Hmm.
Slice of life. Daily life. Hmm.

706
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:10,605
Alright, alright. Then let's look at the first one.

707
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,105
The first thingy... who's acting? We all could do it.

708
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:17,605
家では靴を脱ぐ
Taking shoes off indoors

709
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:17,105
Oh! Taking shoes off indoors. We're definitely not doing that right now.

710
00:38:17,205 --> 00:38:20,105
Definitely. Oh, this is really bad, actually.

711
00:38:22,205 --> 00:38:25,605
I hope Fubuki-senpai won't get mad at us for stepping on her tatami mats...

712
00:38:26,205 --> 00:38:29,105
...I mean, with shoes on here. So, I'm sure it's fine, right?

713
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:31,105
Sorry! Suimasen!
Sorry! Excuse me!

714
00:38:31,205 --> 00:38:33,105
They're slippers, right? Sumimasen.
They're slippers, right? Excuse me.

715
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:36,605
Yeah, but normally there's like a genkan...

716
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:38,105
What's genkan in English?

717
00:38:38,205 --> 00:38:41,105
Entranceway, entrance door, doorway, something.

718
00:38:41,205 --> 00:38:43,105
And there's a little, little... what do you call that? The stair?

719
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:46,605
The one stair. And before that, you always have to take off your shoes.

720
00:38:48,205 --> 00:38:51,105
Shoes off! And in a lot of buildings, too.

721
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:54,105
They usually have like spare slippers that you can wear.

722
00:38:54,205 --> 00:38:57,105
Yeah. You take shoes off even in like public buildings sometimes.

723
00:38:57,205 --> 00:38:58,605
It's crazy!

724
00:38:58,705 --> 00:39:01,105
Slippers! Or the recording studio!

725
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,605
Yeah, yeah. I've actually tripped on one of those...

726
00:39:03,705 --> 00:39:06,105
...where it's got like the indent, like the ledge.

727
00:39:06,205 --> 00:39:09,105
I was coming for the first time and I tripped on it.

728
00:39:09,205 --> 00:39:10,605
Got too excited!

729
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:13,105
Yeah. So that sounds pretty good. Okay, next up...

730
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:20,105
相手の話の合間に「なるほど」をはさむ
Interjecting when someone's talking with short phrases such as "Yes," "I see," etc.

731
00:39:15,205 --> 00:39:19,105
...is... interjecting when someone's talking with short phrases...

732
00:39:19,205 --> 00:39:21,105
...such as "Yes", "I see", etc.

733
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:23,105
Yes, yes. Uh-huh. Hum-hum.

734
00:39:23,205 --> 00:39:25,105
Naruhodo.
I see.

735
00:39:25,205 --> 00:39:27,105
Ah, sou desu ne.
Ah, that's right.

736
00:39:27,205 --> 00:39:30,105
Yeah, sou desu ne! Hai, hai.
Yeah, that's right! Yes, yes.

737
00:39:30,205 --> 00:39:32,605
You can do it to me, because I want to say...

738
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:35,105
...what... after living in Japan...

739
00:39:35,205 --> 00:39:37,105
...more and more I noticed that...

740
00:39:37,205 --> 00:39:40,105
...I was, you know, getting that into my body.

741
00:39:40,205 --> 00:39:44,105
And when I came back home to Austria...

742
00:39:44,205 --> 00:39:47,105
...my... all my family, my friends, they noticed.

743
00:39:47,205 --> 00:39:49,105
Kiwa-wa-wa-wa!

744
00:39:49,205 --> 00:39:52,105
They were like, "You keep on reacting to what I'm saying!"

745
00:39:52,205 --> 00:39:54,605
So, so, so. Yes, yes.
Right, right, right. Yes, yes.

746
00:39:55,205 --> 00:39:57,605
So, but actually, I can't get rid of it anymore.

747
00:39:57,705 --> 00:40:00,105
Wakaru. It's active listening. You're showing them you're listening.
I understand. It's active listening. You're showing them you're listening.

748
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:01,417
Especially when you're talking on the phone and stuff,

749
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:03,617
like they don't know if you're still listening, right?

750
00:40:03,617 --> 00:40:05,017
Is that why you have to say like, "un, un"?

751
00:40:05,017 --> 00:40:06,117
Un, un.

752
00:40:05,017 --> 00:40:06,617
Just like "un" on the phone...

753
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:08,617
...like most people do.

754
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:10,117
Oh, yeah. True.

755
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:13,617
So did you girls also start doing that on your own by now?

756
00:40:13,617 --> 00:40:14,717
Oh, yeah. I do it.

757
00:40:14,717 --> 00:40:15,617
Definitely.

758
00:40:15,617 --> 00:40:16,917
I do it. Oopsie.

759
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,517
Ame, what about you? You haven't been here for that long but...

760
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:20,917
Sometimes, I feel like it's something I would do anyways.

761
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:22,517
Oh, really?

762
00:40:22,517 --> 00:40:25,117
うん、うん。なるほど。
Uh-huh. I see.

763
00:40:25,117 --> 00:40:27,617
But I've been told that it's pretty cute, so...

764
00:40:27,617 --> 00:40:28,917
I'm keeping it.

765
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,917
It is cute!

766
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,917
I agree.

767
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,017
Okay, next up!

768
00:40:33,117 --> 00:40:36,617
Separating tissues depending on usage.

769
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:38,317
Alright Kiara, this one's all you.

770
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:39,217
What! Why?

771
00:40:39,217 --> 00:40:41,917
You're the one who's been blowing your nose for the past 15 minutes.

772
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:42,717
This is true.

773
00:40:42,717 --> 00:40:43,717
Exposed!

774
00:40:43,717 --> 00:40:47,417
But, I'm not sure about this. I don't think this is...

775
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:49,917
Is this like separating the trash, like the garbage and recycling?

776
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:52,117
They separate the trash a lot, yeah.

777
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,917
But then like, not the tissues?

778
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:55,317
But then like...

779
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:57,317
Why aren't you guys playing this game?

780
00:40:57,317 --> 00:40:58,617
Are we doing something wrong?

781
00:40:58,617 --> 00:41:00,717
No, no, we're all doing it.

782
00:41:00,717 --> 00:41:02,617
I'm separating the tissue. Pyun, pyun, pyun!

783
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:04,917
And then also in different trash bags? No way.

784
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:06,117
No way.

785
00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:08,717
I mean, we can... we can put this one aside and kind of...

786
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:10,917
...look at what the last option is.

787
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:13,317
No, no, yeah. Let's look at the last one.

788
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:14,517
Last option. Last-o.

789
00:41:15,617 --> 00:41:19,117
Expressing your gratitude before and after meals.

790
00:41:19,117 --> 00:41:21,117
Ahhh, okay.

791
00:41:21,117 --> 00:41:24,117
いただきます！
Let's eat!

792
00:41:24,117 --> 00:41:27,117
ごちそうさまでした！
Thank you for the meal!

793
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,917
That was so synchronizing!

794
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:31,617
So "Itadakimasu" means "I'm digging in"...

795
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:34,617
...and "Gochisousama deshita" means "Thank you for the meal".

796
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,117
They do indeed say that. We all know that.

797
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:38,317
We know that!

798
00:41:38,317 --> 00:41:40,917
Easy peasy. Easy answer.

799
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:43,117
Do we even have to think?

800
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:44,317
I don't think we have to think.

801
00:41:44,317 --> 00:41:46,117
I've already forgotten them, so...

802
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:47,417
It's okay.

803
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:48,617
I think I remember. Yeah.

804
00:41:48,617 --> 00:41:53,317
So the wrong one is number three!

805
00:41:53,317 --> 00:41:57,117
Yaaay! やった！
Yaaay! We did it!

806
00:41:57,117 --> 00:41:59,117
We did it!

807
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:01,917
そんなことやらない、right?
They don't do things like that, right?

808
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:03,117
Right, right.

809
00:42:03,117 --> 00:42:05,617
That'd be too much work.

810
00:42:05,617 --> 00:42:08,617
It's like, "this one I wiped my food with, you know?"

811
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:11,617
"And this one I blew my nose on." Like...

812
00:42:11,617 --> 00:42:12,917
That's too... too much.

813
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:14,417
No one would play this game.

814
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:15,917
It all gets burned.

815
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:18,617
Yeah, I think so. Exactly.

816
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:22,617
That was... that one was pretty wild. Hmm.

817
00:42:22,617 --> 00:42:25,617
So... what shall we do next?

818
00:42:25,617 --> 00:42:30,117
Okay, notes. Okay, so with that...

819
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:35,117
...I think we all did so perfectly, we don't even need a second round!

820
00:42:35,117 --> 00:42:37,617
Yaaaay!

821
00:42:37,617 --> 00:42:40,117
Okay, but... there's something important...

822
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:42,617
...that everybody needs to pay attention to.

823
00:42:42,617 --> 00:42:44,317
What? I'm listening.

824
00:42:44,317 --> 00:42:47,617
We want to show off our merchandise one more time.

825
00:42:47,617 --> 00:42:50,117
Oh, yeah! Alright!

826
00:42:50,117 --> 00:42:53,617
Everybody in their individual showcases already showed up their individual merch.

827
00:42:53,617 --> 00:42:57,117
We'll take a look at it another time, we'll start with Ina!

828
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:58,617
Okay! Ina-na-na-na!

829
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:02,117
My merch was... the Takodachi Ramen Stopper!

830
00:43:02,117 --> 00:43:06,117
Basically, I think there's a few people who don't know how to use it.

831
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:09,617
Basically, when you, you know, cook cup noodles...

832
00:43:09,617 --> 00:43:13,317
...the lid kind of like always like lifts up.

833
00:43:13,317 --> 00:43:18,317
You put that little Takodachi Ramen Stopper on top of it, so that the lid doesn't lift up.

834
00:43:18,317 --> 00:43:23,117
And then you get like the most perfectly cooked ramen, you know, cup noodles.

835
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:26,117
Or you know, you can just keep it as a figure.

836
00:43:26,117 --> 00:43:29,117
That's helpful actually.

837
00:43:29,117 --> 00:43:31,117
Next up! Kiara!

838
00:43:31,117 --> 00:43:33,117
Yay! So my merchandise was...

839
00:43:33,117 --> 00:43:38,117
...the Hot Phoenix Thermo Bottle and Bottle Case Set!

840
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:41,617
I'm so happy for this one, because it's thermos.

841
00:43:41,617 --> 00:43:44,117
Everybody can use it. You can keep your hot things hot and your cold things cold.

842
00:43:44,117 --> 00:43:47,117
It's perfect! And it even has a little Blue Buddy!

843
00:43:47,117 --> 00:43:49,117
Is it thermal?

844
00:43:49,117 --> 00:43:51,617
Yes, it's thermal!

845
00:43:51,617 --> 00:43:56,617
Inside, yeah. And you can basically use the cap as a cup too!

846
00:43:56,617 --> 00:43:58,617
Big brain!

847
00:43:58,617 --> 00:43:59,917
I can put spaghetti in there.

848
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:01,117
Next me was... Calli!

849
00:44:01,117 --> 00:44:03,617
Calli! Hello, there she goes.

850
00:44:03,617 --> 00:44:07,617
Are you looking for a lovely gift for your significant other?

851
00:44:07,617 --> 00:44:10,617
Perhaps you just want to look cool wherever you go.

852
00:44:10,617 --> 00:44:13,617
Anyone can wear this cool piece of ice.

853
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:16,617
What is it? It's the Mori Calliope Pendant, baby!

854
00:44:16,617 --> 00:44:20,617
You can also just display it in your house, because why not?

855
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:23,617
I'm genuinely asking you, why not? Buy it, or I'll hurt you.

856
00:44:23,617 --> 00:44:25,317
Pretty please!

857
00:44:25,317 --> 00:44:26,617
Buy one!

858
00:44:26,617 --> 00:44:27,917
Thank you everyone! Appreciate you.

859
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:29,617
Okay, next after me was...

860
00:44:29,617 --> 00:44:35,117
Goobidy boobidy booba! Googoogoogoo!

861
00:44:35,117 --> 00:44:37,117
What was your merch?

862
00:44:37,117 --> 00:44:38,317
It's a...

863
00:44:38,317 --> 00:44:39,617
...bag. There it is.

864
00:44:39,617 --> 00:44:41,317
Tell us about it.

865
00:44:41,317 --> 00:44:42,317
Bag.

866
00:44:42,317 --> 00:44:43,317
Bag.

867
00:44:43,317 --> 00:44:44,317
Bag.

868
00:44:44,317 --> 00:44:45,617
What kind of bag is it?

869
00:44:45,617 --> 00:44:47,117
Blue bag.

870
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,617
Blue bag. The shoulder bag.

871
00:44:48,617 --> 00:44:50,117
With strap!

872
00:44:50,117 --> 00:44:51,617
Bag with strap.

873
00:44:51,617 --> 00:44:53,117
It's so cute!

874
00:44:53,117 --> 00:44:55,117
You can fit so much power in here. Bag.

875
00:44:55,117 --> 00:44:57,117
I want one.

876
00:44:57,117 --> 00:44:58,617
And what is it inspired after?

877
00:44:58,617 --> 00:44:59,983
It's my... my bag.

878
00:45:00,129 --> 00:45:01,429
Yama yama yama yama yama! I'm in my casual outfit!

879
00:45:01,429 --> 00:45:02,429
That's right!

880
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:03,529
That's right!

881
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:05,029
Wait, is that the thing you're wearing now?

882
00:45:05,029 --> 00:45:05,929
No, not this!

883
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:08,329
That's just my uniform!

884
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:11,329
It looks like someone stole your sweater and made a bag out of it.

885
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:13,329
Yeah, that's not the worst thing they've made out of it.

886
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:14,629
Recycling!

887
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,929
That's a good point.

888
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:17,529
Okay, and a tissue... a tissue!

889
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:19,529
Who is next?

890
00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:21,129
Last but not least, we have...

891
00:45:21,129 --> 00:45:23,129
...Amelia Watson! Come over!

892
00:45:23,129 --> 00:45:25,929
Hey! Ta-da!

893
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:27,629
There we go!

894
00:45:27,629 --> 00:45:30,129
Oh my god, you have the hat I'm wearing right now!

00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:33,729
On sale today!

896
00:45:33,729 --> 00:45:35,429
Can I take it off and try it on?

897
00:45:35,429 --> 00:45:36,029
No!

898
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:37,529
I'm gonna have to snatch it!

899
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:38,729
I want to sniff it!

900
00:45:38,729 --> 00:45:40,129
But I like hats!

901
00:45:40,129 --> 00:45:43,229
No! You guys are gonna do weird stuff with it, like smell it!

902
00:45:43,229 --> 00:45:44,629
I want to wear hat!

903
00:45:44,629 --> 00:45:47,429
The hat does not smell like Amelia Watson, okay?

904
00:45:47,429 --> 00:45:48,429
That's a lie!

905
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:49,229
It's authentic!

906
00:45:49,229 --> 00:45:50,629

00:46:33,529 --> 00:46:36,229
Oh yeah, I'm holding an invisible book.

924
00:46:36,229 --> 00:46:38,429
Okay, pose, baby, pose!

925

00:46:48,929 --> 00:46:51,729
Wow, they look really cute! Indeed!

931
00:46:54,529 --> 00:46:57,529
So, what do you guys think of these?

932
00:46:57,529 --> 00:46:59,729
They look so great, I want one! I think they're pretty cute.

00:46:59,729 --> 00:47:01,929
Okay, how was it so far, guys?

We're together! Finally we're together!

939
00:47:15,429 --> 00:47:19,529
We're together! We're together! We're together!

940
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:23,129
Can we... can we have a little request?

941
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:24,529
なに なに?
What is it?

942
00:47:24,529 --> 00:47:26,629
It depends... Can we... can we hug?

943
00:47:26,629 --> 00:47:28,329
Hug! Hug!

944
00:47:31,129 --> 00:47:33,329
Ame, you smell good!

945
00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:36,329
I love everyone!

946
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:39,229
I love everyone!

947
00:47:39,229 --> 00:47:41,629
Yay! Happy!

948
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:44,329
Cute! Yay! So that was really healthy!

949
00:47:46,229 --> 00:47:49,129
Everything! We actually wanted to talk a little bit...

950
00:47:49,129 --> 00:47:51,529
...about our... our... this collab...

951
00:47:51,529 --> 00:47:53,529

952
00:47:53,529 --> 00:47:55,829

Group te-te, yes!

00:48:03,529 --> 00:48:05,629
What was your favorite part so far?

957
00:48:05,629 --> 00:48:08,629
Darn it! I'm asking you guys too, what's your favorite part?

958
00:48:08,629 --> 00:48:10,629
What's your favorite part? Gura, what's your favorite part?

959
00:48:10,629 --> 00:48:14,429
Finally being together... and game fun! Game fun!

960
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:16,929
Game fun! I like beating up Amelia!

961
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:18,629
Oh! In... I did not like that!

962
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,629
Yeah you did! You're lying to us, she liked it!

963
00:48:20,629 --> 00:48:22,629
She liked it, yeah! She really liked it!

964
00:48:22,629 --> 00:48:24,529
She liked it, yeah! She's lying, she liked it!

965
00:48:24,529 --> 00:48:26,629
She wanted it! I did not like it!

966
00:48:26,629 --> 00:48:28,529
She wanted it! Her dream came true!

967
00:48:28,529 --> 00:48:32,529
Yay! Done it, done it!

968
00:48:32,529 --> 00:48:34,729
As for performance, they liked the song, they're talking about the music.

969
00:48:34,729 --> 00:48:37,529
Oh yeah, the SFX... I only wish we had more...

970
00:48:37,529 --> 00:48:39,529
...more dancing!

971
00:48:39,529 --> 00:48:41,729
You wish we had more? Oh!

972
00:48:41,729 --> 00:48:43,729
I think they want some more.

973
00:48:43,729 --> 00:48:45,729
There might be more... That is very possible.

974
00:48:45,729 --> 00:48:48,429
Of course, I promised you, pinky promise, that there will be more!

975
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:51,429
That's right! Now a performance, one or two, who knows?

976
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,729
It's coming up! All right!

977
00:48:54,229 --> 00:48:57,229
But we gotta go to the stage for that. Okay!

978
00:48:57,229 --> 00:49:00,229
We're going already. Which way is it?

979
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:03,229
Thank you for the guests and for letting us do this!

980
00:49:03,229 --> 00:49:05,229
Thank you for everyone! Thank you so much!

981
00:49:05,229 --> 00:49:08,629
It went by so fast, we had such a nice time!

982
00:49:08,629 --> 00:49:10,629
Yay yay yay!

983
00:49:10,629 --> 00:49:13,229
All right! We love you! Love you!

984
00:49:13,229 --> 00:49:15,429
Which way should we go? Which way are we going?

985
00:49:15,429 --> 00:49:17,429
This way? This way? I don't know, this way!

986
00:49:17,429 --> 00:49:19,429
いくぞ!
Let's go!

987
00:49:19,429 --> 00:49:22,429
Loading screens too, we love the loading screens!

988
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:24,129
Come on Gura, this way Gura!

989
00:50:00,141 --> 00:51:25,141
Now Loading

990
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:50,141
Non-Fiction
Lyrics: Mori Calliope/Elliot Hsu
Composition・Arrangement: Elliot Hsu

991
00:51:57,441 --> 00:52:03,241
Somewhere's upon a time is not where Myth belongs

992
00:52:03,541 --> 00:52:08,941
Through the faded lines of word and rhyme is a hidden song

993
00:52:09,341 --> 00:52:14,441
Though fractured deeply, warped by sorrows, time and time again

994
00:52:14,441 --> 00:52:16,941
Take my hand and enter our pretend

995
00:52:38,341 --> 00:52:43,941
My silent skies, the moon's still shining, enlightening those alone

996
00:52:44,341 --> 00:52:48,541
Lost souls who hear a song when gone astray

997
00:52:48,941 --> 00:52:51,441
Those stripes upon our lives stay in the light now

998
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:54,941
When forced to behave, we stay and say

999
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:58,341
Be brave!

1000
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:01,741
In a non-fiction, we souls reach out

1001
00:53:01,941 --> 00:53:04,441
And pen toward every page

1002
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:07,541
We ignite, come alive, let the starry night

1003
00:53:07,541 --> 00:53:09,741
With the fire, no doubt, and take our way

1004
00:53:09,841 --> 00:53:12,441
Like a fairy tale where love prevails

1005
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:15,641
The painful now we move relentlessly on by the light

1006
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:19,541
Your spark has burst into the dark

1007
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:37,141
Someone's upon a time is not where a voice gets heard

1008
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:42,441
Will the faded lines of speeding time make us slight? Less words.

1009
00:53:42,641 --> 00:53:47,541
When kindness runs dry, a soul on fire is driven to react

1010
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:50,641
And when burning flames attack

1011
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:53,141
We will never be to black

1012
00:53:53,241 --> 00:53:58,241
No fate it seems, not a dream or a trick of light

1013
00:53:58,341 --> 00:54:03,541
Always make us see, take a seat, it's our glorious time

1014
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:08,441
Who crossed the line, the voice inside that is real as they say

1015
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:10,941
Kind of souls who choose the fate

1016
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:13,841
We could never lose our way

1017
00:54:14,441 --> 00:54:17,941
My starlit skies, and the moon's shining

1018
00:54:18,141 --> 00:54:20,441
Inviting those along

1019
00:54:20,641 --> 00:54:24,841
Lost souls who hear a song when gone astray

1020
00:54:25,241 --> 00:54:27,941
Those stripes upon our lives stay in the light now

1021
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:31,241
When forced to behave, we stay and say

1022
00:54:33,341 --> 00:54:35,141
Be brave!

1023
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:51,441
Defiant 'til the end as the screaming begins

1024
00:54:51,641 --> 00:54:54,741
A brand new burning ember, so unyielding

1025
00:54:54,741 --> 00:54:57,141
Your love's giving me wings

1026
00:54:57,341 --> 00:54:58,941
While wading through the mud for the best time

1027
00:55:01,553 --> 00:55:03,553
I’ll let my soul be for our life

1028
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:09,253
Set every fiber in motion, now we ride

1029
00:55:09,653 --> 00:55:12,453
In a desperate shout, our souls reach out

1030
00:55:12,453 --> 00:55:15,053
To fathom forever space

1031
00:55:15,053 --> 00:55:18,553
We ignite, come alive like a starry night

1032
00:55:18,553 --> 00:55:21,153
With a fire, no doubt, you can’t take away

1033
00:55:21,153 --> 00:55:24,053
Rise above any care, what the world may bear

1034
00:55:24,053 --> 00:55:27,353
Cause today, maybe we will joyfully hover by

1035
00:55:27,353 --> 00:55:32,553
Despite hopeless days or just far off ways

1036
00:55:32,553 --> 00:55:36,653
Nothing breaks, we will lead with all of our hearts

1037
00:55:36,653 --> 00:55:41,353
And smile...

1038
00:55:41,353 --> 00:55:44,353
...side by side...

1039
00:55:44,353 --> 00:55:46,653
...among the stars

1040
00:56:02,553 --> 00:56:05,853
Take off and fly, the longer we wait

1041
00:56:05,853 --> 00:56:09,853
The stronger it makes us as we fight every fate

1042
00:56:09,853 --> 00:56:12,953
Strength, to finally defeat

1043
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:17,153
This journey of a thousand years to me

1044
00:56:17,153 --> 00:56:25,153
Journey Like a Thousand Years ~千年の旅~
Journey Like a Thousand Years

1045
00:56:19,153 --> 00:56:20,353
All right, all right!

1046
00:56:20,653 --> 00:56:22,153
Hands up, hands up!

1047
00:56:22,453 --> 00:56:23,653
Okay!

1048
00:56:31,153 --> 00:56:34,153
Songs unknown, enchanted by rhyme

1049
00:56:34,153 --> 00:56:37,553
Hidden wishes granted by time

1050
00:56:37,553 --> 00:56:41,153
Our longest hopes connecting the dots

1051
00:56:41,153 --> 00:56:44,653
Feel like echoes of ages gone by

1052
00:56:44,953 --> 00:56:48,153
Made a splash, but found I was free

1053
00:56:48,153 --> 00:56:51,653
A fish out of water, bound to the sea

1054
00:56:51,653 --> 00:56:55,353
Then reckless I dived, but you're right by my side

1055
00:56:55,353 --> 00:56:58,653
I bet this moment is how we can ride

1056
00:56:59,153 --> 00:57:04,653
Connecting songs across the sky

1057
00:57:05,653 --> 00:57:08,653
Take off and fly, the longer we wait

1058
00:57:08,653 --> 00:57:12,853
The stronger it makes us as we fight every fate

1059
00:57:12,853 --> 00:57:16,153
Strength, to finally defeat

1060
00:57:16,153 --> 00:57:20,153
This journey of a thousand years to me

1061
00:57:21,153 --> 00:57:24,553
Witness the fire in our minds, burning inside

1062
00:57:24,553 --> 00:57:25,953
Rising again from the ashes

1063
00:57:25,953 --> 00:57:28,653
Every bruise and the scratches makes us feel more alive

1064
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:32,053
We never give up, never give in no matter what’s ahead

1065
00:57:32,053 --> 00:57:35,153
Instead we’ll crush the worries aside

1066
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:39,053
If there's no world for us to touch or to see

1067
00:57:39,053 --> 00:57:42,653
We'll make it ourselves and make the memories

1068
00:57:42,653 --> 00:57:46,153
There ain't a mystery our brains cannot solve

1069
00:57:46,153 --> 00:57:49,153
We just shine brighter, grow tired, evolve

1070
00:57:49,653 --> 00:57:55,153
Connecting songs across the world

1071
00:57:56,653 --> 00:57:59,653
Take off and fly, the longer we wait

1072
00:57:59,653 --> 00:58:03,653
The stronger it makes us as we fight every fate

1073
00:58:03,653 --> 00:58:06,653
Strength, to finally defeat

1074
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:10,653
This journey of a thousand years to me

1075
00:58:11,153 --> 00:58:17,453
At the end of this world, where's our fighting chance?

1076
00:58:17,453 --> 00:58:21,153
Nothing's changing, it's always the same story

1077
00:58:21,153 --> 00:58:24,153
Staged with a difference

1078
00:58:24,453 --> 00:58:27,853
Seek out a happy end, for me and my friends

1079
00:58:27,853 --> 00:58:30,953
And don't you give up on us just now

1080
00:58:30,953 --> 00:58:33,953
I want to see you smile

1081
00:58:33,953 --> 00:58:38,153
Find my way to you somehow

1082
00:58:38,853 --> 00:58:41,153
Take off and fly, the longer we wait

1083
00:58:41,153 --> 00:58:45,453
The stronger it makes us as we fight every fate

1084
00:58:45,453 --> 00:58:48,453
Strength, finally defeat

1085
00:58:48,453 --> 00:58:52,153
This journey of a thousand years to me

1086
00:58:53,153 --> 00:58:55,953
Let’s try, it can’t be denied

1087
00:58:55,953 --> 00:58:59,953
The wish in my heart is you right here by my side

1088
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,953
Strength is all that we’ll need

1089
00:59:02,953 --> 00:59:06,153
I won’t wait a thousand years to be...
