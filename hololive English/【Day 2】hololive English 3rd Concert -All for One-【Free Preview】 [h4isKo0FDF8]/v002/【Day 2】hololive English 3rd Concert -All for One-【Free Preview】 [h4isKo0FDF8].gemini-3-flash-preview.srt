ARE YOU READY TO ROCK? ONE, TWO, THREE!

162
00:39:40,975 --> 00:39:44,375
沈んだ伝説、呪われた幽霊船に
A sunken legend, on a cursed ghost ship...

163
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:52,975
続く夜の航路
...the night voyage continues.

164
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:56,175
そこに何が残る？
What remains there?

165
00:39:56,175 --> 00:40:00,175
回顧、秘めがあるのなら
If there are hidden memories of the past...

166
00:40:00,321 --> 00:40:03,321

170
00:40:13,446 --> 00:40:16,646
止まない雨の弾丸で
With the bullets of unending rain

171
00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:20,346
写し程 この身を焦がす
As much as it reflects, it burns this body

172
00:40:20,346 --> 00:40:23,346
底無の火の花 躍る 色彩
Bottomless flower of fire, dancing colors

173
00:40:23,346 --> 00:40:27,646
蒼乱 崩落的なのなら
If it's chaotic blue, collapsing

174
00:40:31,146 --> 00:40:33,446

輝く船錆びついて
The shining ship is rusted

179
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:51,246

Even so, if you still grasp the darkness

180
00:40:51,246 --> 00:40:56,446
泡沫と共に 沈め
Sink along with the bubbles

181
00:41:09,746 --> 00:41:12,846
海の暇 一人風に吹かれ
At the leisure of the sea, blown by the wind alone

182
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:16,346
誇る邪魔な 海賊の火を
The proud, bothersome pirate's fire

183
00:41:16,346 --> 00:41:21,246
風は笑う
The wind laughs

184
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:24,246

Chasing out the fools

宝探し道連れを
Companions on a treasure hunt

190
00:41:45,246 --> 00:41:48,246
胸に踊る この魂の群れ
This crowd of souls dancing in the chest

191
00:41:48,246 --> 00:41:52,246
影の底で 忍び寄る 絶望の渦
The vortex of despair creeping at the bottom

192
00:41:52,246 --> 00:41:56,646
丸で 歌の閉じた箱
Like a closed music box

193
00:41:57,246 --> 00:42:00,246
食べちゃえば 諦めちゃえば
If I eat it, if I give up

私のもの そう 私のもの
Mine, yes, mine

197
00:42:16,746 --> 00:42:20,246
自分自身を 信じ込ませた 嘘で
With the lies I made myself believe

198
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:25,246
縛り続けてたって 気付いた
I realized I had been keeping myself bound

199
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:28,746
蜘蛛の手口 虎の世の回帰
Spider's trick, return of the tiger's world

200
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:32,246
目を醒ませ あなたの悪夢から
Wake up from your nightmare

207
00:42:56,746 --> 00:43:00,246
そんな幻 そう感じていましょう
Let's feel such an illusion

208
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:05,346
鳴らして 証は 踊る さあさ 行こう
Ring it out, the proof is dancing, now let's go

209
00:43:05,346 --> 00:43:09,746
余計な 殻を剥いて
Peeled off the extra shell

210
00:43:13,846 --> 00:43:16,746
威圧を纏わせた船
The ship clad in coercion

211
00:43:16,746 --> 00:43:20,246
暇な時だけ 残していく
Leaving only when at leisure

212
00:43:20,246 --> 00:43:22,746
神はもう いない
God is no longer here

00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:31,638
La la la la la la la

312
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:32,938
LOW-YA!

313
00:50:33,038 --> 00:50:35,238
La la la la la la la

314
00:50:35,338 --> 00:50:37,538
決めて ANYA
Decide it tonight

315
00:50:37,638 --> 00:50:39,838
La la la la la la la

316
00:50:39,938 --> 00:50:42,138
決めて ANYA
Decide it tonight

317
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:04,238
(Laughter)

318
00:51:06,738 --> 00:51:08,738
I didn't know I'm cheating on Calli!

319
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:10,738
IRyS! You're cheating on Calli!

320
00:51:10,838 --> 00:51:12,538
Yeah, didn't you know?

321
00:51:12,638 --> 00:51:14,538
Oh yeah, oh my god!

322
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,238
Wait, we- we're not doing anything wrong!

323
00:51:16,338 --> 00:51:18,238
We're not- we're not doing anything wrong!

324
00:51:18,738 --> 00:51:21,038
No, no, no, no, we were just... hugging as friends.

325
00:51:21,238 --> 00:51:22,738
It was just te-te, te-te.
It was just heartwarming.

326
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:23,738
Yes. ね？
Yes. Right?

327
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:25,738
Kikkerikii!

328
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:26,738
IRyS!

329
00:51:29,238 --> 00:51:31,238
Okay, let's introduce ourselves, yeah?

330
00:51:31,438 --> 00:51:32,238
Yes!

331
00:51:32,338 --> 00:51:34,238
You! Start with the cheater- oh no.

332
00:51:34,338 --> 00:51:36,438
No, cheat! You also cheater!
No, cheat! You're a cheater too!

333
00:51:36,738 --> 00:51:37,738
Okay, go ahead.

334
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:39,738
Hi! Kikkerikii!

335
00:51:40,738 --> 00:51:43,238
Hi! Uh, I wish I was someone else right now,

336
00:51:43,338 --> 00:51:46,238
but I'm Takanashi Kiara from Hololive English Myth! Yay!

337
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:49,738
And you?

338
00:51:50,238 --> 00:51:53,238
Uh, hi! It's IRyS from Hololive English Promise.

339
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:55,238
Can I get a "Hy-RyS"?

340
00:51:55,338 --> 00:51:57,238
Hy-RyS!

341
00:51:58,738 --> 00:52:00,238
Let's go! Thank you!

342
00:52:00,738 --> 00:52:04,738
We just performed a really hype performance...

343
00:52:05,738 --> 00:52:07,738
...of 決めて ANYA!
...of Kimete ANYA!

344
00:52:10,238 --> 00:52:12,538
This is not my first time performing with you on your song.

345
00:52:12,638 --> 00:52:15,238
Yeah, they put us together a lot these days. Kind of a trend.

346
00:52:15,338 --> 00:52:16,038
It is.

347
00:52:16,238 --> 00:52:17,738
Kiara's the trend.

348
00:52:18,238 --> 00:52:19,738
Yay!

349
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:22,638
I am sure they can't get enough of us, right?

350
00:52:22,738 --> 00:52:24,038
No, of course not!

351
00:52:24,238 --> 00:52:25,738
That's why we're here now, too.

352
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:26,738
We're spice. We're sexy.

353
00:52:27,738 --> 00:52:29,038
Oh, yes we are!

354
00:52:29,238 --> 00:52:30,738
Of course. Yes we are.

355
00:52:32,238 --> 00:52:34,538
LOL. Well, you know, it's the first MC.

356
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:36,738
That's right. Which means...

357
00:52:39,238 --> 00:52:41,238
Um, we're gonna do the sad news, right?

358
00:52:41,738 --> 00:52:44,238
Yes! But I want to deliver the sad news!

359
00:52:44,438 --> 00:52:47,538
It's our first time together, so I want to deliver it too!

360
00:52:47,738 --> 00:52:49,038
I want to do it!

361
00:52:49,238 --> 00:52:50,738
Well, in that case, we battle it out!

362
00:52:51,238 --> 00:52:54,238
We're battling it out! In front of all these people?

363
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:57,738
Yeah, it's no problem. They're gonna cheer for us.

364
00:52:58,238 --> 00:53:00,738
Yeah. When we think of battles, what do we think about?

365
00:53:01,238 --> 00:53:04,738
I think, like, recently, a lot of the EN members

366
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:07,238
have been, like, doing arm wrestling.

367
00:53:07,438 --> 00:53:10,738
And I'm very well known for being a noodle arm person.

368
00:53:10,838 --> 00:53:12,238
What about you?

369
00:53:14,238 --> 00:53:15,738
I am very strong!

370
00:53:16,238 --> 00:53:19,738
Everyone knows that IRyS is very strong! Yeah, sure.

371
00:53:21,238 --> 00:53:24,238
Well, you know, I usually am left-handed,

372
00:53:24,338 --> 00:53:26,738
but I will use my right hand to give you a chance.

373
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:28,238
Okay, thank you Senpai!

374
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:31,238
Okay, okay, okay. I will take that challenge right now!

375
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:32,738
Let's do this!

376
00:53:33,738 --> 00:53:35,238
Okay, come here. Come here, come here.

377
00:53:35,738 --> 00:53:37,238
Three! Count us down!

378
00:53:37,738 --> 00:53:40,238
Three, two, one, go!

379
00:53:53,238 --> 00:53:56,738
I just beat her! With her non-dominant arm!

380
00:53:57,738 --> 00:54:00,238
Yeah, that was my right hand though. My left hand is my dominant arm.

381
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:03,738
So, that wasn't completely fair. Let's do another game!

382
00:54:05,738 --> 00:54:07,738
Another game? Yes!

383
00:54:08,738 --> 00:54:11,738
I mean, yeah, that's true, it wasn't fair. In that case, what- what do you have in mind?

384
00:54:12,238 --> 00:54:15,738
There's this game called, uh, like Blue Light Red Light...

385
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:18,238
No Blue Light. That was Red Light Green Light.

386
00:54:18,738 --> 00:54:20,738
Red Light Green Light. Okay.

387
00:54:21,238 --> 00:54:23,738
Then you perhaps stand on that side,

388
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:26,238
and I go towards you.

389
00:54:26,738 --> 00:54:28,738
Okay, all right, all right. Gotcha.

390
00:54:29,238 --> 00:54:31,238
Okay, then I- I can win this! I will get you.

391
00:54:31,338 --> 00:54:33,238
I will get you, okay?

392
00:54:33,738 --> 00:54:35,738
Red light... oh, green light!

393
00:54:37,738 --> 00:54:40,238
Oh, sorry, we're starting. We're starting. Okay.

394
00:54:40,738 --> 00:54:42,238
Red light! Green light!

395
00:54:44,238 --> 00:54:45,738
Red light! Green light!

396
00:54:46,238 --> 00:54:47,538
Red light! Green light!

397
00:54:47,638 --> 00:54:48,738
Red light! Green light!

398
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:50,238
Red light!

399
00:54:52,238 --> 00:54:55,238
Not my butt! Not my butt!

400
00:54:56,238 --> 00:54:58,538
Okay, yay! But that means it's a draw.

401
00:54:58,738 --> 00:55:00,038
A draw? Which means...

402
00:55:00,569 --> 00:55:01,669
We get to say it together!

403
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:02,169
Oh!

404
00:55:02,169 --> 00:55:03,819
Ahhh!

405
00:55:03,819 --> 00:55:04,919
Perfect ending!

406
00:55:04,919 --> 00:55:05,419
Perfect!

407
00:55:05,419 --> 00:55:08,819
It's not like this was scripted or anything. I swear I actually did it!

408
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:12,619
Oh, no, no, no, no! The only thing that was scripted was our entrance. That...

409
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:13,519
Oh, yeah, that.

410
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:14,519
Yeah, that.

411
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:18,719
Okay, then let's do it! Let's do this! Okay!

412
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:20,819
Everybody watching on YouTube...

413
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:21,319
Mhm.

414
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:28,219
...are you aware that if you don't have a ticket, you might be not able to watch anymore of this?

415
00:55:28,219 --> 00:55:29,619
What!?

416
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:35,219
Yes, guys! This is the last of the free part on YouTube!

417
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:39,419
If you want to watch more, you have to buy the streaming tickets!

418
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:44,519
They're available in the description and the official website!

419
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:48,619
Probably down there! Yeah, you can go get the streaming tickets!

420
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:51,119
Yeah! You would be crying like me...

421
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,719
...until you buy them!

422
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:55,219
Yes! Do what she says! I recommend it!

423
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:58,319
Once you buy them, you'll be happy and you'll be able to watch the rest of the concert!

424
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:02,119
Yes! Yes! Yes! They're saying it too!

425
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:03,719
Buy it! Buy it!

426
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:05,419
Besides that, one more thing...

427
00:56:05,419 --> 00:56:06,119
Mhm.

428
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:09,419
Now that you got your tickets and you're ready to take even more screenshots...

429
00:56:09,419 --> 00:56:14,919
make sure to share them and your thoughts on social media using the hashtag...

430
00:56:14,919 --> 00:56:17,119
...#holoAllforOne! Yes!

431
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,319
So, I think we should also...

432
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:24,219
Speaking of All for One, I think it's time for us to, you know, say the thing.

433
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:25,819
Yeah, the thing!

434
00:56:25,819 --> 00:56:28,419
You guys are aware by now, right?

435
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:29,619
Because of yesterday.

436
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:32,219
It's called All for One. We say it together.

437
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:34,119
We say it together, yeah? All of us.

438
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:36,119
All of us, お願いします！
All of us, please!

439
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:37,619
Are you in or what? Okay!

440
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:40,819
All for One! All for One! Okay, okay!

441
00:56:40,819 --> 00:56:42,819
Are you ready? Okay.

442
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:44,519
Three, two, one...

443
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:48,819
