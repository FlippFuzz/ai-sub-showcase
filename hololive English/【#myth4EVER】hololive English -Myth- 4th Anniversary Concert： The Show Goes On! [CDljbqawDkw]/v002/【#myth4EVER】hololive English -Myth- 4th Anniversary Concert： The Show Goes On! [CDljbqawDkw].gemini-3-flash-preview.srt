2
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,200
Sing out boldly again, continuing this odyssey

3
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,800
We'll start this new refrain, brimming with memories

4
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,500
And when the clouded skies become bright, let's reunite!

5
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,400
Ready? Set?

6
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,700
It's showtime, baby!

7
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,000
I will save this broadcast on slide delay

8
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,300
Ramping up the stuff is really enough

9
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,700
Talk about the lore endlessly, why?

10
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,000
Take it easy, what did we learn?

11
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,300
Start a fire in the hearts of the PC burns

12
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,600
Always optimistic, focus on a quick pitch

13
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,000
Teach new dogs all of our old tricks

14
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,600
Still going stronger than ever and never and never say die

15
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,000
And I'm aware it's ironic, but where's the freaking lie?

16
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,600
Streamers to streamers to entertainers to senpai

17
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,800
Not losing to young people

18
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,100
Ignorant, it's a Myth, don't mind us

19
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,400
Gura! Ame! Kiara! Ina! Calli! Myth!

20
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,700
Spanning new dimensions,

21
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,300
we can bring another mystery to light

22
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,900
Planning our ascension,

23
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,500
dancing in flight, we ignite

24
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,300
Join us while we're celebrating in the Myth that we're creating

25
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,100
There's another story waiting through this world and beyond

26
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,700
Our distant dreams have brought us here

27
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,300
A strong and unyielding bond

28
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,900
Guiding us endlessly,

29
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,500
will bring us moments that we hold dear

30
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,100
Time rushes on;

31
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,700
and though these winds may scatter us

32
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,300
We'll keep this promise;

33
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,900
when the moment's finally right,

34
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,000
we'll always find a way to reunite!

35
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,700
I'm diving in again,

36
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,000
now it's time to sink or swim

37
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,300
Let's try the deeper end,

38
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,600
but could you hold my fin?

39
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,400
Vibing with everyone,

40
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,200
let's kick back and ponder puns

41
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,500
Taco party anytime,

42
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,000
let's get cozy and have fun!

43
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:00,808
...escape death

44
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:02,008
and know that it's morbid.

45
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:03,008
Years come and go,

46
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:04,008
I'll still pretend

47
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:05,108
that I've got this killed and sorted.

48
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:05,908
Listen, I wanna look cool,

49
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:07,408
but I keep on tripping and falling.

50
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:08,808
Guess I'll keep playing the fool

51
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,508
to hold up the commerce calling yatta-yatta.

52
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:13,008
Countless moments

53
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:15,508
led us to this day.

54
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:18,208
Triumph and sorrow, hope for tomorrow,

55
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:21,008
We'll always find our way.

56
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:23,508
Trouble may...

57
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:48,508
In every universe,

58
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:51,508
we were always meant to meet.

59
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:54,308
I'll lead a boundless search,

60
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:57,008
we will never know defeat!

61
00:05:57,008 --> 00:06:00,008
My wings will guide your hands

62
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:02,508
as the fateful days go by,

63
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:05,308
We will carve a path

64
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:08,008
through a never-ending sky!

65
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:11,208
Drawing us together,

66
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,308
I can sense another wish is coming true.

67
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:17,308
Each typhoon we weather

68
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:20,008
strengthens our crew, me and you.

69
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:25,008
Sing out again,

70
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:28,008
the clouded skies give way to clear,

71
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:31,008
We'll start this new refrain,

72
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:33,508
brimming with memories,

73
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:35,008
another story starting right here.

74
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:37,508
We'll keep forging ahead

75
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:40,008
To make a saga all our own.

76
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:43,308
Whichever paths we tread, steadily journeying,

77
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:46,508
We know we're never really alone—

78
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:49,008
If we believe,

79
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,508
wherever fate may find us,

80
00:06:51,508 --> 00:06:53,508
Our love will bind us.

81
00:06:53,508 --> 00:06:56,008
Every epic chapter we write

82
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:58,008
will set us on the path

83
00:06:58,008 --> 00:07:00,008
to reunite!

84
00:07:55,008 --> 00:08:00,008
Journey Like a Thousand Years ~千年の旅~

85
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:11,808
A song in snow, enchanted by rhyme...

86
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:15,508
Painted in wishes, granted by time...

87
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:19,008
Our longest hopes connecting yet those...

88
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:22,508
Be like echoes of ages gone by.

89
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:24,508
Made a splash,

90
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:26,308
but found I'm not free,

91
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:28,108
A fish out of water

92
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,808
bound to the sea.

93
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:33,308
Then a reckless high tide brought you right by my side,

94
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:36,508
I bet this moment's a wave we can ride.

95
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:41,508
Connecting songs across the sky.

96
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:44,508
Take off and fly,

97
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:46,008
the longer we wait,

98
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:48,008
The stronger it makes us

99
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:49,508
as we fight every fate.

100
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:52,508
Strength to finally defeat

101
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:54,508
this journey of a thousand years

102
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:57,508
to meet.

103
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:02,508
Witness the fire of minds burning inside,

104
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,208
Resonating from the ashes,

105
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,008
every bruise and scratch makes us feel more alive.

106
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:08,008
We never give up, never give in

107
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:09,508
no matter what's ahead,

108
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:13,008
instead we'll crush all our worries aside.

109
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:14,808
If there's no world

110
00:09:14,808 --> 00:09:16,508
for us to touch or to see,

111
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:18,508
We'll make it ourselves

112
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:20,508
and make memories.

113
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:22,008
There ain't a mystery

114
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:23,808
our brains cannot solve,

115
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:25,608
We just shine brighter

116
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,508
and tighter evolve.

117
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:32,508
Connecting songs across the world.

118
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:35,008
Take off and fly,

119
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,008
the longer we wait,

120
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:38,508
The stronger it makes us

121
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:40,008
as we fight every fate.

122
00:09:40,008 --> 00:09:43,008
Strength to finally defeat

123
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:45,008
this journey of a thousand years

124
00:09:45,008 --> 00:09:48,008
to meet.

125
00:09:49,008 --> 00:09:52,008
At the end of this world, where's our fighting chance?

126
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,508
Nothing's changing, it's always the same story

127
00:09:54,508 --> 00:10:00,008
stays with a different dance.

128
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:05,516
We've got a happy end

129
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:08,516
For me and my friends and those who've loved us up until now

130
00:10:08,516 --> 00:10:11,816
I wanna see you smile

131
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:15,516
Find my way to you somehow

132
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,016
Take off and fly

133
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:20,516
The longer we wait

134
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:23,016
The stronger it makes us as we fight every fate

135
00:10:23,216 --> 00:10:26,016
Strength to finally defeat

136
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:29,516
This journey a thousand years to meet

137
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:31,216
Let's try!

138
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:33,216
It can't be denied

139
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:37,016
The wish in my heart is you right here by my side

140
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,516
Strength is all that we'll need

141
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:43,816
I'll hope wait a thousand years to meet

142
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:46,516
To meet...

143
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,416
Done!

144
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:26,516
Yeah!

145
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:28,516
Good work everybody! Let's hype!

146
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:30,016
Yatta, yatta!

147
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:32,216
Yeah! We did it once again!

148
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,816
And once again, hi guys!

149
00:11:34,016 --> 00:11:36,516
Hi guys!

150
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,016
Yeah, we're off to a flying start already but...

151
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:43,016
...to properly kick things off, welcome everybody

152
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:46,516
to hololive English -Myth- 4th Anniversary Live:
The Show Goes On!

153
00:11:46,516 --> 00:11:48,516
Welcome everybody!

154
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:51,216
Yeah, yeah! Thanks for coming!

155
00:11:51,516 --> 00:11:54,516
Yeah, well, well done. Let's start off with
a round of introductions.

156
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:56,216
So, who will be first?

157
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,216
Me! Me! Me!

158
00:11:58,516 --> 00:11:59,616
Let's do it first! Come on!

159
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:01,516
You know the rules and so do I.

160
00:12:01,816 --> 00:12:04,016
Oh, okay, so it'll be me.

161
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:08,216
Alright. Kikiriki! Hello everybody, I'm Takanashi
Kiara from hololive English -Myth-.

162
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:10,216
You'll hear that a lot today.

163
00:12:10,516 --> 00:12:12,016
So, who's next?

164
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:14,516
A-do-mo-do-mo-do-mo! Same desu!

165
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:17,016
Gawr Gura desu! Chark-kun, oh no!

166
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:21,016
Chark shark, Gawr Gura desu!

167
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:23,216
Keep 'em coming, keep 'em coming!

168
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:26,016
Water? Oh me? Okay.

169
00:12:26,216 --> 00:12:30,516
(Clears throat) Minna-san! Hi, I think you guys
maybe know who I am.

170
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,216
My name is Mori Calliope from
hololive English -Myth-.

171
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:37,216
I am a virtual singer, artist, creator,
I stream, I play games too.

172
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,516
Nice to meet you if we have already met,
if we haven't, if we have... hi.

173
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:46,216
Someone take the mic away from me, I'm so bad
at these, I'm always so bad, someone else do it.

174
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,216
Who's next? Ame? Ame, perhaps?

175
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:52,516
Okay! I'm Amelia Watson, number one detective
from hololive English!

176
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:56,516
Yeah, yeah! And last but not least... Wah!

177
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:59,516
Wah! Wah! Wah!

178
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:03,516
Wah! Good morning, afternoon, evening everyone!

179
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:07,216
I'm Ninomae Ina'nis from... oh wait.

180
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:10,216
I'm Ninomae Ina'nis and together we are...

181
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:16,516
hololive English -Myth-!

182
00:13:16,816 --> 00:13:19,216
We did it! Told you you'll hear it a lot.

183
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:24,216
So with our introductions out of the way,
feast your eyes on the venue we have today!

184
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:28,516
Check it out! Whoa! New stage!

185
00:13:28,816 --> 00:13:32,216
Look, a brand new stage made for our
4th anniversary!

186
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:36,216
Look at our songs! Our songs are everywhere!
Our originals!

187
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:37,616
Finally! It was... pretty high!

188
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,216
Look, some Valentine's stuff! Cute!

189
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:42,216
Yeah, I love it. We're stars!

190
00:13:42,516 --> 00:13:46,216
That's really, really nice. This stage...

191
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:50,216
So... um, I'm sure it's obvious, right everybody?

192
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:54,216
We've got a full divine exquisite...
for 'The Show Goes On'.

193
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:59,216
Can you guess what the theme is?
Anyone? Anyone?

194
00:13:59,516 --> 00:14:02,516
Hai, sensei! Tropical island vacation!

195
00:14:02,816 --> 00:14:03,616
No, no, no.

196
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:06,816
Okay, I got it. Underwater sea adventure!

197
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:08,216
Are you for real?

198
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:12,216
What? You asked me! It's definitely that one.

199
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:16,216
Okay, no. I don't think they'll have
good answers either, so...

200
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:21,516
Those two boneheads. Okay, drumroll though.
Come on! Brrrr...

201
00:14:21,816 --> 00:14:24,516
It's Broadway!

202
00:14:24,816 --> 00:14:26,216
I knew that.

203
00:14:26,516 --> 00:14:29,816
Yeah. And it's not just, you know, a Broadway,
it's also a red carpet!

204
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:32,516
Do you like to do a catwalk? Ina? Okay.

205
00:14:32,816 --> 00:14:36,216
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Let's go ladies, let's go!

206
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:42,016
Let's go! Wow! Model walk! Fashion, baby!

207
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:46,216
Nice, that's what I really wanted to do, thanks.
Alright.

208
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,616
That was pretty cool too.

209
00:14:47,816 --> 00:14:53,216
So, along with the stunning backdrop, you guys,
I hope you will enjoy our grand performance.

210
00:14:53,616 --> 00:14:56,216
But it's not just any live concert...

211
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:58,816
We've got a fun surprise waiting for them,
don't we ladies?

212
00:14:59,016 --> 00:14:59,816
Oh yeah!

213
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:01,224
Surprise!

214
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:02,024
Hmm.

215
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:03,024
Wait, Ina...

216
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:05,524
Ame, Ame, Ame!

217
00:15:05,624 --> 00:15:06,524
We have a surprise?

218
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:08,324
Yeah. Wait, did you forget already, Ina?

219
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,324
Didn't hear it?

220
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:10,524
About the surprise?

221
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:13,524
I mean, it's not a surprise if we don't-- if we know about it.

222
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:14,824
Play along, play along!

223
00:15:14,824 --> 00:15:15,824
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

224
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:18,524
We have a surprise, guys! Yay!

225
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:19,524
Yay!

226
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:20,524
Oh, we know about it, of course.

227
00:15:20,724 --> 00:15:24,024
Well, if you keep on watching until the end, you will indeed find out.

228
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:27,524
So, in the meantime, everybody, I ask you to use the hashtag...

229
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:30,524
...that is at the top right corner of your screen...

230
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:33,524
...to let us know what you think about our cute performance tonight!

231
00:15:33,624 --> 00:15:36,424
And... where should they post the screenshots?

232
00:15:36,524 --> 00:15:38,024
My fridge!

233
00:15:38,224 --> 00:15:40,524
Ah... Your fridge?

234
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:42,524
Post them on X...

235
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,524
...formerly known as Twitter.

236
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:46,524
Yeah! Yeah!

237
00:15:46,624 --> 00:15:48,324
Not-- not the Fridge-gator.

238
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:49,824
Hey! Spelling bee ladies.

239
00:15:49,924 --> 00:15:50,924
Oh god.

240
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:52,224
They know.

241
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:53,824
(Ahem)

242
00:15:53,924 --> 00:15:56,524
Everybody, hololive English -Myth-...

243
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:59,024
...now presents our 4th anniversary live...

244
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,024
...The Show Goes On in...

245
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:03,524
SHOWTIME!

246
00:16:03,524 --> 00:16:06,024
(Cheering)

247
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:28,024
3, 2, 1, come on!

248
00:16:28,124 --> 00:16:32,024
Full Color
Lyrics: WUNDER RIKU
Music, Arrangement: Snail's House

249
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:36,524
Hey! Alright!

250
00:16:37,024 --> 00:16:38,824
Come on Dead Beats!

251
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:40,224
And Chumbuds!

252
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:42,524
All together now, come on!

253
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:04,124
Something that lasts, buried long ago

254
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:07,524
But soon I'll forget, in the gray boring road

255
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:12,124
But I thought I might drown, then I see a butterfly

256
00:17:12,124 --> 00:17:16,724
Headphones on I hear that song and open up my eyes

257
00:17:16,724 --> 00:17:17,924
And I know...

258
00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:20,524
世界はまだ
The world is still...

259
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:23,024
なくなってないから
...not gone yet

260
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:25,524
今もずっと
Even now, always

261
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:28,424
Deep breath and fly away we go, each step we take a common show

262
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:32,024
When hope is lost I'll let you know, se-no!

263
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:35,824
Ev'ry melody just needs a place to start

264
00:17:35,824 --> 00:17:39,824
And ev'ry dream needs a refrain

265
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:44,224
Each neon light illuminates your heart

266
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:48,024
So let the rhythm guide your way

267
00:17:48,024 --> 00:17:51,524
And dance away with me

268
00:17:51,524 --> 00:17:53,024
You'll see

269
00:17:53,524 --> 00:17:57,024
夢と現実は同じ
Dreams and reality are the same

270
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:04,824
夢と現実は同じ
Dreams and reality are the same

271
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:16,224
Something I found, sparkle of life

272
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:19,524
Rainbow of sound, it lives deep inside

273
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:23,824
My heart wants to beat for so long

274
00:18:23,824 --> 00:18:28,024
Knocks loud and now I know it, now I'm right where I belong

275
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,024
十色の世界を
Casting off the...

276
00:18:31,024 --> 00:18:34,024
脱ぎ去り
...ten-color world

277
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:40,024
Deep breath and fly and then just be, reality is what you believe

278
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:44,424
Listen with me and then you'll see

279
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:48,424
Ev'ry melody just needs a place to start

280
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:52,424
And ev'ry dream needs a refrain

281
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:56,424
Each neon light illuminates your heart

282
00:18:56,424 --> 00:19:00,424
So let the rhythm guide your way

283
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:04,024
And dance away with me

284
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:05,524
You'll see

285
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:09,524
夢と現実は同じ
Dreams and reality are the same

286
00:19:13,824 --> 00:19:17,524
夢と現実は同じ
Dreams and reality are the same

287
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:33,524
夢と現実は同じ
Dreams and reality are the same

288
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,424
That's right, I'm not just a phoenix...

289
00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:56,224
...I'm a TENTOU!

290
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:58,524
Look at this!

291
00:19:58,524 --> 00:20:00,024
Woo!

292
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,052
When we first met

293
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:20,532
I wonder what you think of me

294
00:20:20,665 --> 00:20:23,082
Do you imagine set

295
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:25,832
That was a perfect merrier day

296
00:20:25,982 --> 00:20:28,032
Well the time went by

297
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:30,232
I forgot to hide

298
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:32,432
The laughs that came so naturally

299
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:34,082
Through lows and highs

300
00:20:34,215 --> 00:20:35,932
I wonder why

301
00:20:36,082 --> 00:20:38,282
I ever thought you would leave

302
00:20:38,432 --> 00:20:40,532
Now no matter where or when we are

303
00:20:40,682 --> 00:20:42,532
I know it's you I can count on

304
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:43,732
Magical

305
00:20:43,882 --> 00:20:45,082
Mythical

306
00:20:45,232 --> 00:20:47,532
Nothing can stop us now

307
00:20:47,682 --> 00:20:48,632
Let's go!

308
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:50,532
Chikutaku worth the tango

309
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,032
Wakuwaku how should I know

310
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:56,032
Why it seems when you're here with me

311
00:20:56,182 --> 00:20:58,032
The clock won't stop spinning

312
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,032
Waku waku waku waku

313
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:01,532
Doki doki hearts beat faster

314
00:21:01,682 --> 00:21:04,532
Tomodachi friends forever

315
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:06,532
It's clear to see

316
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,532
That this mystery was solved immediately

317
00:21:08,682 --> 00:21:11,532
Jiku no yugami
Distortion of space-time

318
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:28,032
It's been so long

319
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:30,532
Since I laughed so hard I cried

320
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:33,032
Now you came along

321
00:21:33,182 --> 00:21:35,532
It happens almost every time

322
00:21:35,682 --> 00:21:37,532
That I hear your voice

323
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:39,532
I'm left no choice

324
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:42,032
But to let you know what you mean to me

325
00:21:42,182 --> 00:21:44,532
Spiraling, time skipping

326
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:47,032
Through treasured memories

327
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:50,032
Now no matter where or when we're from

328
00:21:50,182 --> 00:21:52,532
Our friendship's elementary

329
00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:53,732
Case closed

330
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:55,032
Now you know

331
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:57,532
Nothing can stop us now

332
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:58,632
Let's go!

333
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:00,532
Chikutaku worth the tango

334
00:22:00,682 --> 00:22:03,032
Wakuwaku how should I know

335
00:22:03,182 --> 00:22:06,032
Why it seems when you're here with me

336
00:22:06,182 --> 00:22:08,032
The clock won't stop spinning

337
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:09,032
Waku waku waku waku

338
00:22:09,182 --> 00:22:11,532
Doki doki hearts beat faster

339
00:22:11,682 --> 00:22:14,532
Tomodachi friends forever

340
00:22:14,682 --> 00:22:16,532
It's clear to see

341
00:22:16,682 --> 00:22:19,032
That this mystery was solved immediately

342
00:22:19,182 --> 00:22:22,032
Jiku no yugami
Distortion of space-time

343
00:22:22,182 --> 00:22:25,032
Which day we're old

344
00:22:25,182 --> 00:22:28,032
What the future holds is

345
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:30,532
Knock knock knock for us to know yet

346
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,532
Go go go before we know it

347
00:22:33,682 --> 00:22:36,532
So let's solve the question

348
00:22:36,682 --> 00:22:39,532
We can make each second

349
00:22:39,682 --> 00:22:42,532
Chikutaku last forever

350
00:22:42,682 --> 00:22:45,032
Wakuwaku now or never

351
00:22:47,782 --> 00:22:50,532
Chikutaku worth the tango

352
00:22:50,682 --> 00:22:53,032
Wakuwaku how should I know

353

Why it seems when you're here with me

354
00:22:56,182 --> 00:22:58,032
The clock won't stop spinning

355
00:22:58,132 --> 00:22:59,032
Waku waku waku waku

356
00:22:59,182 --> 00:23:01,532
Doki doki hearts beat faster

00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:04,532
Tomodachi friends forever

358
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:06,532
It's clear to see

359
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:09,032
That this mystery was solved immediately

360
00:23:09,182 --> 00:23:10,532
Jiku no yugami
Distortion of space-time

361
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:16,032
That's right! I am the Phoenix! I'm KFP! Look at this!

362
00:23:34,182 --> 00:23:38,032
Eclogo alos, egveni lagos

363
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:59,532
水面に映る自分がいた
I saw myself reflected on the water's surface.

364
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:08,032
ああ 私は悪いサメです
Ah, I am a bad shark.

365
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:12,532
ずっと逸れていた
I had been straying away the whole time.

366
00:24:12,682 --> 00:24:16,532
赤く光るその目
Those eyes glowing red.

367
00:24:16,682 --> 00:24:23,032
海の底 暗闇に消えていく
They disappear into the darkness at the bottom of the sea.

368
00:24:23,682 --> 00:24:25,532
どうして泣くのよ
Why are you crying?

369
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:27,532
Your tired eyes begin to fall

Get everything you want.

371
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:33,532
教えて私は
Tell me, did I...

372
00:24:32,032 --> 00:24:35,532
Your darkest thoughts unleash them all

373
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:39,532
望んでいた私になれたかな
...become the me I wanted to be?

374
00:24:39,682 --> 00:24:43,532
嘘はつかない でも本当じゃない
I don't lie, but it's not the truth either.

375
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:47,032
本音は言わない 方が楽じゃない
Isn't it easier to not speak your true feelings?

376
00:24:47,182 --> 00:24:50,532
いつかは分かり合える時が来るの？
Will the time ever come when we understand each other?

377
00:24:47,182 --> 00:24:50,532
A time, a place for darker days

378
00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:55,032
分かり合える時来るの？
Will the time to understand each other come?

379
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,840
Look at this so-called "gem of the sea,"
I'll unscramble you, know what I mean?

380
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,340
But who're you watching now?
It ain't much of a now, it shows.

383
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,040

It's fine if I'm not the ideal figure.

00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,540
ただ分かってほしいだけよ
I just want you to understand.

385
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,540
理想通りじゃなきゃ意味なんてない
If it's not as ideal, there's no meaning.

386
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,440
希望も夢すら無くたって
辛い 辛い 辛い 辛い
Even without hope or dreams,
it's painful, painful, painful, painful.

387
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,540
あなた居場所はあるのかしら？
Do you even have a place where you belong?

388
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,440
諦めて楽になるわ さぁ
Give up and you'll be at ease, come on.

389
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,240
ずっと追い求めた
Chasing it all this time,

390
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,840

自分にだけは嘘はつきたくないの
I don't want to lie to myself at the very least.

392
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,340
ごめんね
I'm sorry.

393
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,240
One story ends 今まで

394
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Begin again (Begin)
気づかなかったことがあるんだけど
Begin again (Begin),
though there are things I didn't notice.

395

396
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,240
Until the end (Until the end)

Until the end (Until the end),
I am who I am because you were there.

397
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,040
過去はいらない？ そんなことはない
Don't need the past? That's not true.

398
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,840
未来は見えない方がマシじゃない？
Isn't it better not to see the future?

399
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,540
ここから No matter where
静かに Watch over me
From here, no matter where,
quietly watch over me.

400
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,540
私を見守っていてね
Please keep watching over me.

401
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,040
So, you think that's all, huh?

402
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,240
Just gotta leave like it's nothing?

403
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,240
Going without me?
I don't know what you're thinking!

404
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,240
Return to the sea,
a shark is all you'll ever be. さよなら。
Return to the sea,
a shark is all you'll ever be. Farewell.

405
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,040
One story ends ありがとう Begin again

408
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,240
すべてを受け入れて生きていくから
Because I'll live accepting everything.

409
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,240
海の底はつまらないけど
The bottom of the sea is boring, but

410
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,840
あなたの言葉 忘れないから
I won't forget your words.

411
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,840
いつでも No matter where
どこでも Watch over me
Anytime, no matter where,
anywhere, watch over me.

412
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,440
私らしく生きていこう
I'll live as myself.

413
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,540
不退転の覚悟、曲がるかな？
Does the determination of no retreat bend?

414
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,078
Time to die, bird!
No!

415
00:27:40,078 --> 00:27:42,388
It's your time to go!
No!

416
00:27:42,388 --> 00:27:44,240
I'm gonna get you finally!

417
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,840
Get over here! Get over here!
You stupid bird!

418
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,540
Sorry! I thought whatever I did!
Dogeza, dogeza, dogeza!

419
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,440
That's what I thought. Kneel!

420
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,840
What did I do?

421
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,040
You guys forget that I'm a killer.

422
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,640
Actually, sometimes I forget that I'm a killer.

423
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,540
Whoops. That was fun though!
How did you guys like Reflect?

424
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,840
That was dramatic, right?
Dramatic!

425
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,240
Yes! I got to make up for my
lack of dancing skills...

426
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,540
...with drama.

427
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,040
What do you lack?

428
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,240
You did so well!

429
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,040
I-I don't know! It was really tough.

430
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,440
And with the scythe, right?

431
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,540
It is very heavy.
It looks like it's not very heavy,

432
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,240
but it actually weighs a ton.
I'm just really strong, you see.

433
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,040
But the way you're dancing around with it
is kind of dangerous.

434
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,840
Yeah, sorry about that if I accidentally hit you.

435
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,440
It would be curtains for you,
but maybe that's what I secretly want.

436
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,540
Hmm? So we did Reflect together!

437
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,840
We did! As our duo song.

438
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,440
And what did you do?

439
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,540
I did "Full Color" by... Gura!
I love that song so much.

440
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,240
Still unreleased! Oh, so unreleased.

441
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,440
Where is it, Goombus?

442
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,840
But I will say that that was probably the
hardest choreography,

443
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,240
the solo choreography that I've learned,
aside from maybe Go Getter.

444
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,840
Maybe that... that was the hardest.

445
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,540
That's good, you have to challenge yourself!

446
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,840
I was happy to challenge myself to learn that.

447
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,540
And I still know the movements.

448
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,240
You know, the hip sway is so fun!

449
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,840
Yeah, I can imagine.

450
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
What about you? What did you sing?

451
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,840
I did "Ame-Ame-Chiku-Taku"!

452
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,540
Well, you know, actually originally when they were like,
"Okay, so we're gonna do the switcheroo,"

453
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,540
"you sing whatever whose song you want to sing,"

454
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,840
And I said, "Ame, Ame, please let me do Chiku-Taku!
I want to sing Chiku-Taku!"

455
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,540
I was like the first, I think, to shout out, so...

456
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,540
I know how much you love that song.

457
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,840
And I loved your bouncy movements to it.

458
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,240
And "Aree!" I like that you changed the lyrics too.

459
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,240
"I'm not just a phoenix, I'm a Tencho"?

460
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,540
Yeah, something like that. Something like that.

461
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,540
It was cute.

462
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,540
そうですね。
That's true.

463
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:48,840
And we finished it off with our Reflect, which I think is
made for... you know, to be a duet after all.

464
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,540
It's a duet after all.
And we make a really good duet.

465
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,440
So there seems to be a theme, right?
There is a theme here.

466
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,840
Of doing each other's songs.

467
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,240
It seems so. Interesting.

468
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,040
Well, I wonder what will be next!

469
00:30:01,348 --> 00:30:02,148
Because of that...

470
00:30:02,348 --> 00:30:04,948
What are your guesses? Who will do who and like what song?

471
00:30:05,148 --> 00:30:07,448
Hmm, what you thinkin'?

472
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,348
Naruhodo, chat.
I see, chat.

473
00:30:09,548 --> 00:30:10,548
Okay.

474
00:30:11,248 --> 00:30:13,148
So, maybe your wish will come true.

475
00:30:14,248 --> 00:30:16,848
Well, it's not over yet. まだまだ!
Well, it's not over yet. Not yet!

476
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,548
全然ですね。全然!
Not at all. Not at all!

477
00:30:18,848 --> 00:30:21,048
So we gotta pump up the energy just a little bit more, you guys.

478
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:22,048
Pump!

479
00:30:22,148 --> 00:30:26,048
Keep it going, because there's so much more left. Let's enjoy together... or else.

480
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:28,048
Well, just remember I'm a killer.

481
00:30:28,148 --> 00:30:29,848
Take her seriously guys, I'm so scared.

482
00:30:30,048 --> 00:30:32,448
People forget that I'm the reaper. I'm crazy!

483
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,348
I'll come after you, I promise. I'm crazy.

484
00:30:34,548 --> 00:30:35,348
As you just saw.

485
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:37,748
Anyway... okay, how should we end it?

486
00:30:38,248 --> 00:30:40,948
Get excited! TakaMori! Yeah!

487
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:45,348
TakaMori!

488
00:30:46,548 --> 00:30:48,048

Oh you wish that I stay down

600
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,152
But then I just rise

601
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,521
You're not my enemy

602
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:41,424
Baby you're dead to me

603
00:36:41,424 --> 00:36:45,428
Hear my voice screaming out loud

604
00:36:45,428 --> 00:36:46,529

Louder like that!

618
00:37:17,593 --> 00:37:20,162
Chimerediediedia

619
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:20,162
Make 'em buzz

620
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:56,599
Ha ha ha...

花が寝る夜に 映った星

636
00:39:22,384 --> 00:39:27,589
ずっと手を繋いでも 君に吸い付いてみても
Even if we hold hands forever, even if I try to cling to you

637
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:32,794

right through

657
00:41:24,364 --> 00:41:26,364
those nights

658
00:41:26,364 --> 00:41:28,164
I'll never find my way back to you

659
00:41:28,164 --> 00:41:30,264
inside this labyrinth of lights

660
00:41:30,264 --> 00:41:31,964
there was madness

661
00:41:31,964 --> 00:41:33,264
in the meaning

662
00:41:33,264 --> 00:41:34,464
never laughless

663
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,164
we were screaming at the

664
00:41:36,164 --> 00:41:38,264
top of our lungs to the numbness

665
00:41:38,264 --> 00:41:40,064
this city never died.

666
00:41:41,264 --> 00:41:43,864
I'll fly

667
00:41:43,864 --> 00:41:45,964
no proof

668
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:47,464
those heights

669
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:49,664
I'll never find another chance to say

670
00:41:49,664 --> 00:41:52,064
hey, thanks for saving my life

671
00:41:52,064 --> 00:41:53,664
i was hopeless

672
00:41:53,664 --> 00:41:54,664
it was stinging

673
00:41:54,664 --> 00:41:55,764
running roadless

674
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:57,664
we were singing at the

675
00:41:57,664 --> 00:41:59,364
top of our lungs to the numbness

676
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:01,264
this city never died.

677
00:42:03,264 --> 00:42:04,964
what was the root of it all?

678
00:42:04,964 --> 00:42:05,964
...I couldn't say.

679
00:42:05,964 --> 00:42:07,464
I used to jump and then fall,

680
00:42:07,464 --> 00:42:08,564
rugged and cliched.

681
00:42:08,564 --> 00:42:10,564
Would shrug it off without complaint, not a sound

682
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:13,664
No use in trying to find friends, cuz in the end nobody sticks around

683
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,864
It's when you shoved yourself into a crowded place

684
00:42:15,864 --> 00:42:18,164
that you turned around and found yourself in love in outer space

685
00:42:18,164 --> 00:42:20,164
Cue the reckless nights, no strings,

686
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:22,164
laughing at our own dreams...

687
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,064
Just what the hell was so funny?

688
00:42:24,064 --> 00:42:26,564
Bark up the wrong tree, stumble, used to falling great heights

689
00:42:26,564 --> 00:42:29,064
amidst a concrete jungle, singing cuz it felt right

690
00:42:29,064 --> 00:42:30,964
we mixed the ennui and troubles rhyming our discontent

691
00:42:30,964 --> 00:42:34,064
and though it's history, I can't forget the time that we spent

692
00:42:34,064 --> 00:42:35,364
convinced that this could mean another end

693
00:42:35,364 --> 00:42:37,364
exists between real and pretend

694
00:42:37,364 --> 00:42:39,864
a twisted alter-fiction where I missed my chance, did not ascend and

695
00:42:39,864 --> 00:42:42,564
Disappearing into the mist of "never happened"

696
00:42:42,564 --> 00:42:44,864
is the me that I can never befriend.

697
00:42:44,864 --> 00:42:46,464
...I let it go.

698
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:49,064
fade in, fade out

699
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:51,564
this crazy dream

700
00:42:51,564 --> 00:42:54,064
without a direction, floating aimlessly

701
00:42:56,564 --> 00:42:59,064
there's nothing left back there for me

702
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:02,164
breathe in,

703
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:05,564
but it won't stop the rain from pouring

704
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:08,564
We'd run

705
00:43:08,564 --> 00:43:10,564
right through

706
00:43:10,564 --> 00:43:12,564
those nights

707
00:43:12,564 --> 00:43:14,664
I'll never find my way back to you

708
00:43:14,664 --> 00:43:16,864
inside this labyrinth of lights

709
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:18,564
there was madness

710
00:43:18,564 --> 00:43:19,864
in the meaning

711
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:20,964
never laughless

712
00:43:20,964 --> 00:43:22,664
we were screaming at the

713
00:43:22,664 --> 00:43:24,464
top of our lungs to the numbness

714
00:43:24,464 --> 00:43:26,364
this city never died.

715
00:43:26,364 --> 00:43:28,564
but was there ever a soul inside?

716
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:31,064
chasing fireflies between the soaring high-rises

717
00:43:31,064 --> 00:43:33,864
left a trail behind defined it "wasted time of our lives"

718
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:36,164
silent singer, overworked and underpaid

719
00:43:36,164 --> 00:43:38,564
thinks an office is a coffin until off is where you're laid

720
00:43:38,564 --> 00:43:40,464
yet a thought persists, an optimist who ought to be afraid

721
00:43:40,464 --> 00:43:43,964
saw the "nothing wrong" in writing songs behind the lonely shade

722
00:43:43,964 --> 00:43:46,464
is the world a sadder place without the words that you conveyed?

723
00:43:46,464 --> 00:43:49,064
when the ladder fell and shattered every bar that we had played?

724
00:43:49,064 --> 00:43:51,564
Does it matter in the end the sound diminished and decayed

725
00:43:51,564 --> 00:43:54,064
and your friends grew tired of fantasy you're wishing they had stayed?

726
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,164
You don't get to say "I miss you"

727
00:43:56,164 --> 00:43:58,564
you watched your heroes fade

728
00:43:58,564 --> 00:44:00,064
into the rear view-mirror of the villain you portrayed

729
00:44:00,064 --> 00:44:02,364
Stop the pity party, listen, you don't get to be dismayed

730
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:04,264
you don't get to be emotional, feel blessed you got it made

731
00:44:04,264 --> 00:44:06,264
these the best of years of life because you chose to make a trade

732
00:44:06,264 --> 00:44:08,564
recollect the days you hoped and you prayed for this

733
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:11,064
What is there to miss?

734
00:44:11,064 --> 00:44:13,064
fade in, fade out

735
00:44:13,064 --> 00:44:15,564
this hazy dream

736
00:44:15,564 --> 00:44:17,564
without a direction, roaming aimlessly

737
00:44:21,564 --> 00:44:24,064
there's nothing left back there for me

738
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:31,564
pretend it's the end of a made up story

739
00:44:31,564 --> 00:44:34,064
I'll fly

740
00:44:34,064 --> 00:44:35,864
no proof

741
00:44:35,864 --> 00:44:37,464
those heights

742
00:44:37,464 --> 00:44:39,664
I'll never find another chance to say

743
00:44:39,664 --> 00:44:41,864
hey, thanks for saving my life

744
00:44:41,864 --> 00:44:43,164
i was hopeless

745
00:44:43,164 --> 00:44:44,264
it was stinging

746
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,364
driving roadless

747
00:44:45,364 --> 00:44:47,364
we were singing at the

748
00:44:47,364 --> 00:44:49,064
top of our lungs to the numbness

749
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:51,064
this city never died.

750
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:53,664
I'll say goodbye to the soul inside

751
00:44:53,664 --> 00:44:56,064
somehow there was romance in our self-hate

752
00:44:56,064 --> 00:44:59,064
we've got no chance in this light maze

753
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,472
I'll keep on dancing...

754
00:45:01,472 --> 00:45:02,572
...through the night haze...

755
00:45:02,572 --> 00:45:04,272
...it was so fast to this cold jump...

756
00:45:04,272 --> 00:45:05,572
...tell the truth now...

757
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:07,572
...you know it's time we're the same ones...

758
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:09,572
...waking up now to the real life...

759
00:45:09,572 --> 00:45:13,572
...lemme daydream 'til the next night...

760
00:45:13,572 --> 00:45:17,572
I'll keep waiting...

761
00:45:18,572 --> 00:45:22,572
I'll keep waiting for you

762
00:45:46,072 --> 00:45:47,872
Waking up now...

763
00:45:47,872 --> 00:45:49,272
...to my real life...

764
00:45:49,272 --> 00:45:51,272
...lemme daydream 'til the next flight...

765
00:45:51,272 --> 00:45:53,072
...drowning so long...

766
00:45:53,072 --> 00:45:54,672
...I got older...

767
00:45:54,672 --> 00:45:56,572
...now the crowd's gone...

768
00:45:56,572 --> 00:45:57,672
...is it over?

769
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:58,572
Is it over...

770
00:46:10,072 --> 00:46:12,872
(Exhales)

771
00:46:12,872 --> 00:46:14,872
Hello everyone!

772
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:18,472
Thank you for joining us tonight!

773
00:46:18,472 --> 00:46:19,472
Thank you!

774
00:46:19,472 --> 00:46:21,072
So, how has it been so far?

775
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:26,572
How did you guys like my rendition
of Mori Calliope's "Future Island"?

776
00:46:26,572 --> 00:46:28,272
It was amazing!

777
00:46:28,272 --> 00:46:31,072
Oh my god! Ina, so cute!
So cute, so cute, so cute!

778
00:46:31,072 --> 00:46:32,472
Thank you!

779
00:46:32,472 --> 00:46:35,472
And Gura performed Kiara's "Chimera"!

780
00:46:35,472 --> 00:46:40,872
Whoo!

781
00:46:40,872 --> 00:46:43,072
Gura, you're so cute!

782
00:46:43,072 --> 00:46:48,872
And you performed it so well!
It's like... seeing Kiara, but... true!

783
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:51,572
And Ame! My piece was Ina's "Violet".

784
00:46:51,572 --> 00:46:54,472
How does it feel having your own
song performed in front of you?

785
00:46:54,472 --> 00:46:57,572
I mean, I always love it when you sing...

786
00:46:57,572 --> 00:47:01,872
...and you bring a new energy to the song!
I liked it!

787
00:47:01,872 --> 00:47:05,572
And just now, the three of us
performed "end of a life".

788
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:11,872
And we want to make things fresh and exciting,
so as you can probably tell...

789
00:47:11,872 --> 00:47:15,572
...we've been singing each other's
original songs tonight!

790
00:47:15,572 --> 00:47:17,572
And now we have two more songs that,

791
00:47:17,572 --> 00:47:20,572
you know, you guys can enjoy.

792
00:47:20,572 --> 00:47:22,572
Two more songs! Oh man!

793
00:47:22,572 --> 00:47:27,272
But ladies, don't forget about the title
of our live concert tonight.

794
00:47:27,272 --> 00:47:30,272
"The Show Goes On!" And it will!

795
00:47:30,272 --> 00:47:33,472
Yes! Yeah!

796
00:47:33,472 --> 00:47:35,272
So everyone, everyone, don't click away!

797
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:37,072
Don't! Don't! I see you!

798
00:47:37,072 --> 00:47:40,872
Our next song will kind of deviate from our,

799
00:47:40,872 --> 00:47:43,672
the shuffle that we've been doing,
but you're going to love it just as much, right?

800
00:47:43,672 --> 00:47:44,872
That's right! Yeah!

801
00:47:44,872 --> 00:47:47,572
Well, in that case,
let's not keep our guests waiting!

802
00:47:47,572 --> 00:47:49,072
Up next is our penultimate piece!

803
00:47:49,072 --> 00:47:51,072
Enjoy!

804
00:47:51,072 --> 00:47:53,472
Enjoy!

805
00:48:00,472 --> 00:48:02,572
One, two, three!

806
00:48:02,572 --> 00:48:06,572
The Show Goes On!
Lyrics: Steph Music, Arrangement: 山下智輝
The Show Goes On!
Lyrics: Steph Music, Arrangement: Yamashita Tomoki

807
00:48:06,572 --> 00:48:08,872
Light the floodlights, let's begin

808
00:48:08,872 --> 00:48:11,572
We'll start stage right and shuffle on in

809
00:48:11,572 --> 00:48:13,572
(It's time for Myth, ready to steal the show!)

810
00:48:13,572 --> 00:48:15,572
We're jumping with joy, let's go!

811
00:48:15,572 --> 00:48:18,072
Curtain's up, so cue the band

812
00:48:18,072 --> 00:48:22,572
We'll keep on entertaining hand in hand

813
00:48:24,472 --> 00:48:26,572
It's our greatest moment yet

814
00:48:26,572 --> 00:48:29,072
A spectacle they'll never forget!

815
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,072
(We're all aglow, party from dusk to dawn)

816
00:48:31,072 --> 00:48:33,072
(The show will go on and on!)

817
00:48:33,072 --> 00:48:35,572
Tell them that we're here to stay and

818
00:48:35,572 --> 00:48:38,072
Spread the news from Tokyo to Broadway!

819
00:48:41,872 --> 00:48:43,372
Gleaming

820
00:48:43,372 --> 00:48:45,872
(Ooh!) Spotlight

821
00:48:45,872 --> 00:48:48,072
Get the gang together,
we're boogieing all night

822
00:48:48,072 --> 00:48:49,272
Beaming

823
00:48:49,272 --> 00:48:51,072
(Ooh!) So bright

824
00:48:51,072 --> 00:48:53,072
Now we're feeling all right!

825
00:48:53,072 --> 00:48:55,572
Since the day we met,
we've all been going strong

826
00:48:55,572 --> 00:48:57,072
(It's been so long, ooh!)

827
00:48:57,072 --> 00:49:00,072
And we'll keep moving right along!

828
00:49:00,072 --> 00:49:01,572
So keep on dancing, yeah, you bet

829
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:03,572
Ain't nothing gonna stop us,
we're a perfect quintet!

830
00:49:03,572 --> 00:49:05,572
(In harmony no matter where we go)

831
00:49:05,572 --> 00:49:08,072
(It's meant to be, don't you know?)

832
00:49:08,072 --> 00:49:10,572
We're gonna feel so alive when it's us five

833
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,872
Ready to put on another show!

834
00:49:33,472 --> 00:49:36,272
There's a ton to celebrate

835
00:49:36,272 --> 00:49:39,572
The mood is fun and we're feeling great!

836
00:49:42,572 --> 00:49:45,072
From the rafters to the aisles

837
00:49:45,072 --> 00:49:50,072
Contagious laughter and our biggest smiles!

838
00:49:56,572 --> 00:49:59,072
We'll slay 'em like we always do

839
00:49:59,072 --> 00:50:01,072
Make no bones about it!

840
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,113
We'll slay 'em like we always do, make no bones about it!

841
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,246
When I'm with you, it's divine, it's exquisite.

842
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:09,380
On land or in water, we've never been hotter; it feels sublime.

843
00:50:09,513 --> 00:50:12,780
We're friends for all time!

844
00:50:13,246 --> 00:50:15,513
(Come on, listen to the Tentacult and jive with me.)

845
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:17,680
(gonna shake your feathers here with KFP.)

846
00:50:17,713 --> 00:50:19,913
(Deadbeats keeping rhythm while the Teammates spin.)

847
00:50:19,946 --> 00:50:22,713
(The Chumbuds join right in!)

848
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:26,446
We're like a work of art, and I'm gonna keep you in my heart.

849
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,280
We'll stick together.

850
00:50:30,413 --> 00:50:34,080
Myth forever!

851
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,113
Symphony of sight and sound, turning like a merry-go-round,

852
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,113
(We can get 'em cheering even more!)

853
00:50:45,146 --> 00:50:46,246
(On and on and encore!)

854
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,180
Dream another dream with me,

855
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:51,646
Now it's time to change the key!

856
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,480
Light the floodlights, keep 'em lit,

857
00:50:56,546 --> 00:50:59,180
Tonight's our night, and we've got a hit!

858
00:51:02,913 --> 00:51:05,213
Get in line beside me now,

859
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,646
it's almost time to take another bow!

860
00:51:08,746 --> 00:51:11,913
We'll stay on track, you know that I've got your back!

861
00:51:11,946 --> 00:51:13,413
(I say) Get on the dance floor

862
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:14,580
(Okay!) Hear the applause roar

863
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,246
(Each day) The music will

864
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,980
Go on and on, and encore!

865
00:51:20,046 --> 00:51:21,546
(Old friends) Wherever you go

866
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,046
(New gens) I'm gonna follow

867
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,546
(No ends) The music will

868
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:29,013
Go on and on, an endless show!

869
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,413
(Sighs)

870
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,980
Oh my legs!

871
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,213
Oh my god!

872
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,713
I'm getting so old!

873
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,113
That was intense!

874
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,280
Oh, so intense!

875
00:52:03,346 --> 00:52:04,613
That was a good time.

876
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,780
Yeah!

877
00:52:05,846 --> 00:52:09,213
Well, you guys just listened to Myth's new song,

878
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,080
"The Show Goes On!"

879
00:52:11,146 --> 00:52:12,380
What'd you think?

880
00:52:12,446 --> 00:52:14,446
Alright! Very show-tuney!

881
00:52:14,513 --> 00:52:15,613
Yeah, Broadway!

882
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,880
We figured we'd stick with the Broadway theme

883
00:52:18,946 --> 00:52:22,146
and make it something like, you know, a musical?

884
00:52:22,213 --> 00:52:25,046
Something that would make everyone jump on their feet and dance!

885
00:52:25,113 --> 00:52:27,846
And we would be dancing, and we would be dancing!

886
00:52:27,913 --> 00:52:29,413
Yes, yes!

887
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,013
It was so goofy!

888
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,480
So genki!

889
00:52:32,546 --> 00:52:33,813
Yeah, fun times!

890
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,413
And the title truly encapsulates what we think.

891
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,513
We really want the fun to last forever and ever...

892
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,013
with Myth.

893
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,813
And to make that happen, all of us in Myth

894
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,413
are going to do the best we can.

895
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,246
And those are the feelings that we packed

896
00:52:50,313 --> 00:52:52,513
nicely into this new song.

897
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,713
Yeah!

898
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,380
Hope you guys will listen to it a lot,

899
00:52:55,446 --> 00:52:58,613
because it will be on the streaming platforms very soon!

900
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,413
So get ready to wear out your speakers!

901
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,546
And also the MV is going to be right after this.

902
00:53:04,613 --> 00:53:06,580
We're going to raid into it! Be ready!

903
00:53:06,646 --> 00:53:07,846
Oh yeah!

904
00:53:07,913 --> 00:53:09,246
Be ready for that?

905
00:53:09,313 --> 00:53:10,613
Go check it out! Yeah!

906
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,846
But that's not all!

907
00:53:11,913 --> 00:53:13,513
Maybe another little surprise...

908
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,680
what else we have...

909
00:53:14,746 --> 00:53:17,446
merchandise coming out!

910
00:53:17,513 --> 00:53:19,546
Merch! More goods! Stands! Let's go!

911
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,746
Exactly!

912
00:53:20,813 --> 00:53:23,580
Now, we will not show it right now,

913
00:53:23,646 --> 00:53:25,946
but it will be shown at the very end of the stream,

914
00:53:26,013 --> 00:53:29,413
at the ending screen, so stay tuned for that!

915
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,313
Don't immediately leave the stream, okay?

916
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,480
Yeah, yeah!

917
00:53:32,546 --> 00:53:33,880
So, we don't have much time left.

918
00:53:33,946 --> 00:53:36,646
I thought I'd like to hear what you ladies are currently feeling.

919
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,013
Who wants to go first?

920
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,946
Oh, me me me!

921
00:53:39,013 --> 00:53:40,146
Alright! Go Shark!

922
00:53:40,213 --> 00:53:41,446
E-yah!

923
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:43,213
Whoa! Oh my god!

924
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,146
Shark split out of nowhere, I guess.

925
00:53:46,213 --> 00:53:48,413
I guess she can do that, alright, fine, whatever!

926
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,680
That's why she was so excited to go first!

927
00:53:51,746 --> 00:53:53,680
Of course! What about Ame?

928
00:53:53,746 --> 00:53:55,780
It's showtime, baby!

929
00:53:55,846 --> 00:53:58,280
Ame, it was really good, right? Right?

930
00:53:58,346 --> 00:54:00,680
Hope you guys enjoyed it! Thank you so much!

931
00:54:00,746 --> 00:54:01,913
Go Ame!

932
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,546
So good!

933
00:54:03,613 --> 00:54:04,680
Good time.

934
00:54:04,746 --> 00:54:05,780
Okay, who else, who else?

935
00:54:05,846 --> 00:54:06,713
Maybe you?

936
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:10,046
Well, well, you know, it kind of reminded me

937
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:13,313
of like, you know, when Myth started together in the past,

938
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,880
and with our journey of a thousand years, and now with

939
00:54:16,946 --> 00:54:20,613
all these performances into the future... Oh!

940
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,913
Future! Future! Future!

941
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,780
I like future! Future!

942
00:54:24,846 --> 00:54:28,246
危険な海に浮かぶ島へ...
To an island floating on a dangerous sea...

943
00:54:28,313 --> 00:54:31,480
...嵐が運ぶ皆祭 自分の名を知らぬまま
...a festival carried by the storm, still not knowing your own name

944
00:54:31,546 --> 00:54:33,346
Sorry, sorry, not the eggheads!

945
00:54:33,413 --> 00:54:34,980
Not the eggheads!

946
00:54:35,046 --> 00:54:36,780
We're playing around too much.

947
00:54:36,846 --> 00:54:38,280
Good segue into Calli!

948
00:54:38,346 --> 00:54:39,546
True!

949
00:54:39,613 --> 00:54:41,280
Oh me? Oh gosh!

950
00:54:41,346 --> 00:54:43,946
Well, I don't know guys, um...

951
00:54:44,013 --> 00:54:46,880
I feel like, I feel like, I just feel like

952
00:54:46,946 --> 00:54:50,080
we've been through so much together and... and...

953
00:54:50,146 --> 00:54:53,280
and I'm so happy to be by your side and you guys are the best!

954
00:54:53,346 --> 00:54:54,913
E-yah!

955
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,946
Oh! Oh! Oh!

956
00:54:57,013 --> 00:54:58,380
That's Broadway! That's not Broadway!

957
00:54:58,446 --> 00:54:59,913
You guys don't like my theater moves?

958
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,113
No, no!

959
00:55:00,688 --> 00:55:02,188
Gimme, gimme, gimme something wholesome, come on!

960
00:55:02,388 --> 00:55:04,288
Fine, fine, fine. I love singing

961
00:55:04,288 --> 00:55:06,588
songs that I love with people that I love.

962
00:55:06,588 --> 00:55:08,588
That's it. That's all there is to it.

963
00:55:08,588 --> 00:55:10,888
I had a lot of fun with you guys. You guys are the best.

964
00:55:10,888 --> 00:55:13,288
And, uh, yeah, before I get too sappy,

965
00:55:13,288 --> 00:55:15,888
somebody else take the mic. I think we all have

966
00:55:15,888 --> 00:55:18,588
words for everybody, but next up is Kiara!

967
00:55:18,588 --> 00:55:19,888
Kiara, what did you think?

968
00:55:19,888 --> 00:55:22,588
Yes! Well, today I did a little bit of MCing here.

969
00:55:22,588 --> 00:55:24,088
I hope I did it well.

970
00:55:24,088 --> 00:55:26,088
But for me, you know, I realized,

971
00:55:26,088 --> 00:55:28,588
when we joined, our oldest senpais, I think,

972
00:55:28,588 --> 00:55:30,888
were around like four years, right?

973
00:55:30,888 --> 00:55:32,588
Four years into the game.

974
00:55:32,588 --> 00:55:35,588
And now, we're four years in!

975
00:55:35,588 --> 00:55:38,088
Wow, so we're old!

976
00:55:38,088 --> 00:55:41,288
We're like really proper senpais now.

977
00:55:41,288 --> 00:55:44,288
And everybody, you gotta respect us, pay the senpai tax.

978
00:55:43,288 --> 00:55:44,288
Pay up!

979
00:55:43,888 --> 00:55:44,888
Pay up please!

980
00:55:44,888 --> 00:55:48,088
So all of these four years, hopefully more, and

981
00:55:48,088 --> 00:55:50,588
you know, I want to make more memories.

982
00:55:50,588 --> 00:55:52,588
This was definitely a big, nice memory.

983
00:55:52,588 --> 00:55:55,288
So the show must go on, the show goes on indeed,

984
00:55:55,288 --> 00:55:57,288
just like the title.

985
00:55:57,288 --> 00:55:59,888
We're gonna do our best, so please support us,

986
00:55:59,888 --> 00:56:01,588
listen to the new song!

987
00:56:02,588 --> 00:56:04,588
And with that, I think we can gather together!

988
00:56:04,588 --> 00:56:05,588
All right!

989
00:56:05,588 --> 00:56:08,588
Together! Huddle, huddle, huddle, huddle!

990
00:56:08,588 --> 00:56:10,588
Myth huddle, Myth huddle, Myth huddle!

991
00:56:10,588 --> 00:56:12,288
You guys ready? Here we go. All right.

992
00:56:12,288 --> 00:56:13,588
Mori Calliope!

993
00:56:13,588 --> 00:56:14,888
Takanashi Kiara!

994
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:16,088
Ninomae Ina'nis!

995
00:56:16,088 --> 00:56:17,288
Gawr Gura!

996
00:56:17,288 --> 00:56:19,088
Watson Amelia!

997
00:56:19,088 --> 00:56:20,588
Together, we're...

998
00:56:20,588 --> 00:56:22,888
Myth!

999
00:56:22,888 --> 00:56:24,588
Let's go!

1000
00:56:24,588 --> 00:56:26,088
Okay, positions!

1001
00:56:33,288 --> 00:56:35,088
We’re ready to greet the world

1002
00:56:35,088 --> 00:56:36,588
We’re voyaging forward

1003
00:56:36,588 --> 00:56:39,888
With courage to run toward a brand-new start

1004
00:56:39,888 --> 00:56:41,588
Let’s go live!

1005
00:56:41,588 --> 00:56:45,588
Bridging the distance across the sea endlessly

1006
00:56:45,588 --> 00:56:48,288
Cheerfully,

1007
00:56:48,288 --> 00:56:52,588
Meeting heart to heart

1008
00:56:52,588 --> 00:56:58,588
Connect the World
Lyrics: Steph Music, Arrangement: 中野領太
Connect the World
Lyrics: Steph Music, Arrangement: Ryota Nakano

1009
00:57:00,288 --> 00:57:03,588
Waking from a dream, swept up into a stream

1010
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:06,588
I make a wish and wait for my cue

1011
00:57:06,588 --> 00:57:09,588
How will we connect in this new frontier?

1012
00:57:09,588 --> 00:57:12,088
We’re journeying through

1013
00:57:12,088 --> 00:57:15,088
Budding in a scene where no one’s ever been

1014
00:57:15,088 --> 00:57:18,088
With vibrant colors bursting like stars

1015
00:57:18,088 --> 00:57:21,088
Radiant and warm, charged with energy

1016
00:57:21,088 --> 00:57:26,588
That’s carried us this far

1017
00:57:26,588 --> 00:57:30,588
Each new debut brings a miracle to life

1018
00:57:30,588 --> 00:57:32,088
Surely,

1019
00:57:32,088 --> 00:57:34,088
We’ve gotta take that chance

1020
00:57:34,088 --> 00:57:39,088
We’re running non-stop, straight to the top, that’s right!

1021
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:40,888
We’re ready to change the game

1022
00:57:40,888 --> 00:57:44,288
A shimmering showcase, creating a new place

1023
00:57:44,288 --> 00:57:46,588
Where we can shine

1024
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:51,588
Day by day, sparkling stories will intertwine

1025
00:57:51,588 --> 00:57:53,288
Get ready to cross the waves

1026
00:57:53,288 --> 00:57:56,588
We’re voyaging forward with courage to run toward

1027
00:57:56,588 --> 00:57:58,288
A brand-new stage

1028
00:57:58,288 --> 00:58:00,088
Let’s go live!

1029
00:58:00,088 --> 00:58:04,088
Bridging the distance across the sea endlessly

1030
00:58:04,088 --> 00:58:06,288
Follow me,

1031
00:58:06,288 --> 00:58:12,588
And we’ll turn the page

1032
00:58:12,588 --> 00:58:15,888
Breaking through the doubt, we know we’ll figure out

1033
00:58:15,888 --> 00:58:19,088
A way to clear each towering trial

1034
00:58:19,088 --> 00:58:23,088
Sharing all our hopes, we can conquer any challenge

1035
00:58:23,088 --> 00:58:27,588
With a smile

1036
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:31,088
We’ll link our hearts as we search across the globe

1037
00:58:31,088 --> 00:58:33,288
Knowing,

1038
00:58:33,288 --> 00:58:36,588
No matter where we are, no matter how far,

1039
00:58:36,588 --> 00:58:38,088
We can be stars

1040
00:58:38,088 --> 00:58:40,088
Let’s go!

1041
00:58:52,888 --> 00:58:55,888
I want to chase a wish and never-ending dream

1042
00:58:55,888 --> 00:58:58,588
Playing out a grand story

1043
00:58:58,588 --> 00:59:01,888
Share the futures that we can see

1044
00:59:01,888 --> 00:59:04,588
Making them reality

1045
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:07,588
Take my hand and reach for this dream

1046
00:59:07,588 --> 00:59:10,588
All we need are glittering dreams

1047
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:18,588
Our hearts and souls, all fulfilled in the world we built

1048
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,588
We’re ready to seize the day

1049
00:59:20,588 --> 00:59:24,288
Traversing the pathways, discovering highways

1050
00:59:24,288 --> 00:59:26,588
To everywhere

1051
00:59:26,588 --> 00:59:31,288
Step by step, gathering stories that we can share

1052
00:59:31,288 --> 00:59:33,288
Get ready to lead the way

1053
00:59:33,288 --> 00:59:36,888
With each generation, a shining sensation,

1054
00:59:36,888 --> 00:59:38,288
A dream unfurled

1055
00:59:38,288 --> 00:59:40,088
Let’s make friends,

1056
00:59:40,088 --> 00:59:44,088
Making a moment of history joyfully

1057
00:59:44,088 --> 00:59:46,588
Follow me,

1058
00:59:46,588 --> 00:59:48,588
We’ll connect the world

1059
00:59:48,588 --> 00:59:54,088
They’ll hear our song, ringing out over hills and oceans

1060
00:59:54,088 --> 01:00:03,088
Our legend grows and continues

1061
01:00:00,176 --> 01:00:01,396
Carry on

1062
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:02,346
Starting now

1063
01:00:02,346 --> 01:00:04,996
Setting hearts in motion

1064
01:00:04,996 --> 01:00:10,396
Connecting all of the world

1065
01:00:25,196 --> 01:00:27,096
Yay! Kikkeriki, everyone!

1066
01:00:27,146 --> 01:00:30,896
Did you enjoy the hololive English -Myth- 4th Anniversary Live:

1067
01:00:30,896 --> 01:00:33,496
"The Show Goes On"?

1068
01:00:34,146 --> 01:00:36,546
I know it's hard to say goodbye,

1069
01:00:36,596 --> 01:00:38,246
but before we go,

1070
01:00:38,296 --> 01:00:40,496
we have some awesome merch to show you!

1071
01:00:42,596 --> 01:00:45,396
First up, we have this: the Acrylic Block.

1072
01:00:45,446 --> 01:00:49,046
The illustration theme is Broadway musical-esque retro outfits,

1073
01:00:49,096 --> 01:00:51,196
perfectly fitting for our live show.

1074
01:00:51,246 --> 01:00:54,096
And it was drawn by the amazing Aki Akane-sensei.

1075
01:00:54,096 --> 01:00:56,896
It's a two-layer design, giving it a nice depth.

1076
01:00:56,896 --> 01:00:59,396
The thick acrylic makes it look great just as it is.

1077
01:00:59,446 --> 01:01:01,096
Alright, on to the next one!

1078
01:01:02,596 --> 01:01:04,596
Next we have: Collection Cards.

1079
01:01:04,646 --> 01:01:07,496
These cards have a special touch with a translucent material

1080
01:01:07,546 --> 01:01:11,196
and foil stamping, making them feel extra festive.

1081
01:01:11,246 --> 01:01:13,396
Each of us in Myth has our own card,

1082
01:01:13,446 --> 01:01:15,896
so be sure to collect them all.

1083
01:01:15,946 --> 01:01:16,896
Alright, next up!

1084
01:01:18,546 --> 01:01:21,396
Let's see... ooh, we got Mini Mascot Plushies!

1085
01:01:21,446 --> 01:01:24,496
Each Myth member's mascot has turned into a cute plushie!

1086
01:01:24,546 --> 01:01:27,596
But this time, they're all dressed up with hats and ribbons

1087
01:01:27,646 --> 01:01:29,896
to match the live show. How cute!

1088
01:01:29,946 --> 01:01:32,496
And, you can attach them to your bag

1089
01:01:32,546 --> 01:01:35,096
and take them anywhere you want.

1090
01:01:35,146 --> 01:01:36,596
Let them see the world!

1091
01:01:36,646 --> 01:01:38,296
Okay, what do we have next?

1092
01:01:42,646 --> 01:01:44,796
Next up is the Crossbody Bag.

1093
01:01:44,846 --> 01:01:47,396
It's a simple everyday-use bum bag.

1094
01:01:47,446 --> 01:01:50,596
The inside design features Myth's motif icons,

1095
01:01:50,646 --> 01:01:52,696
making it super stylish.

1096
01:01:52,746 --> 01:01:54,696
Perfect for carrying the keychains around

1097
01:01:54,746 --> 01:01:56,396
when you go out.

1098
01:01:58,446 --> 01:02:00,896
Thanks, or should I say, Dankeschön, everyone!

1099
01:02:00,946 --> 01:02:04,096
I sure feel like I want to collect them, and I hope you do the same.

1100
01:02:04,146 --> 01:02:06,696
And last but not least,

1101
01:02:06,746 --> 01:02:10,596
thank you so much for supporting hololive English -Myth-.

1102
01:02:10,646 --> 01:02:13,296
Come catch us at the next show or stream!

1103
