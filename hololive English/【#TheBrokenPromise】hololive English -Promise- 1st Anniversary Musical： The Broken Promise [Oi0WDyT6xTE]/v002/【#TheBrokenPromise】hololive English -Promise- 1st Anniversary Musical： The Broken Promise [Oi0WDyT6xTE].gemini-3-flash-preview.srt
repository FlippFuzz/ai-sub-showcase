00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:08,000
The Broken Promise

3
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,230
For aeons,

4
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,000
light and dark have fought ceaselessly

5
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,450
for dominion over the world.

6
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The Broken Promise

7
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,000
Whispers echo of a dark lord whose insidious

8
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,550
grip on the realm is marked by insatiable...

9
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,950
...lust.

10
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,250
Twisted jealousy,

11
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,250
ravenous greed,

12
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,150
unrelenting vanity,

13
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,050
and possessive manipulation.

14
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,550
A group of adventurers rose to face this threat,

15
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:15,950
with hidden wishes of secrets and shadows untold.

16
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,850
First, there was Nameless,

17
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,850
quick as an owl in the night.

18
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
WANTED: STOLEN STRAWBERRY CAKE

19
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:27,550
A thrill-seeking thief she was, who hunted in the fringes of society.

20
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:34,250
Next was Cora, a passionate chronomancer and hostess,

21
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,000
whose connections to this world felt as thin as

22
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
the threads of time she manipulated

23
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,850
to build her harem.

24
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,350
Faelin was a guardian of nature

25
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,000
whose sweet, charming exterior

26
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,750
belied her true nature.

27
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,250
Descended from the heavens, Irisa brought...

28
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,108
...tidings of doom.

29
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:05,108
Her innocent and clumsy demeanor...

30
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:10,508
...stood in contrast to her perfectionist tendencies.

31
00:05:12,308 --> 00:05:13,708
Lastly,

32
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:18,408
Hexa, a bard who had yet to find her spotlight.

33
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:21,808
Dazzling were her performances,

34
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:27,508
whilst her silent dreams of recognition gnawed at her heart.

35
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:33,208
On a warm summer night, amidst the flickering candlelight...

36
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,808
...of the Singing Shark Inn,

37
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:40,408
they found their fates intertwined with that of...

38
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:43,108
...a malevolent Dark Lord,

39
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:47,408
whose shadow slowly consumed everything in their path.

40
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,408
Hey Faelyn.

41
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:03,808
How dost thou cope with death?

42
00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:05,708
The fear thereof, I mean.

43
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:10,308
Hmm, tending to my plants does help...

44
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:13,108
...stave off the looming spectre of the void, if but for a spell.

45
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,508
Plants, huh?

46
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:16,708
Tried that once.

47
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,008
Killed them all.

48
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:21,008
Guess I'm destined to bring death one way or another.

49
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:25,508
Perhaps thou art stick to nursing pints rather than plants, Hexa.

50
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:28,108
Nature's children are precious.

51
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:30,108
Thy liver is not.

52
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:33,608
Haha! I'll drink to that!

53
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,208
Comely maiden,

54
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,208
might I follow thee home?

55
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,608
'Twas my mother's wish that I follow my dreams.

56
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,408
A fine distraction, Kora.

57
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:50,008
Namu is so clever, isn't she?

58
00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:54,008
Thou mistakest me for thine accomplice, Namu.

59
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:58,508
Canst thou not see I am trying to work my magic here?

60
00:06:59,108 --> 00:07:02,508
Already resorting to time magic to ensnare thy quarry?

61
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:05,108
'Twas but a turn of phrase.

62
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:07,708
I hardly need magic to court a maiden fair.

63
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,108
Merely my unending charm.

64
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:12,708
Hast thou not enough trinkets already?

65
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:15,108
I take no more than I need to survive.

66
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:16,308
I promise.

67
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:17,608
Woohoo!

68
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:21,008
It would seem at least someone is getting lucky tonight!

69
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,408
Let me see.

70
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,708
What'd you get?

71
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:29,408
Fie!

72
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,508
Here comes the guard!

73
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:32,408
That is my cue to vanish.

74
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:33,508
Namu,

75
00:07:33,508 --> 00:07:38,208
methinks the guard doth not arrive bathed in heavenly light.

76
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:41,208
Greetings, esteemed patrons!

77
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,208
I seek stouthearted souls to accompany me...

78
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,008
...on a dangerous—

79
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,308
Aah!

80
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:51,108
How charming.

81
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,808
‘Tis not a journey to be taken lightly.

82
00:07:56,808 --> 00:08:00,008
The darkness grows stronger by the day.

83
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:04,208
Join me, and thy deepest wish will be granted.

84
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,508
Deepest wish?

85
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:08,008
Sounds like a ruse to me.

86
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:09,108
What think you?

87
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:10,808
Might be,

88
00:08:10,808 --> 00:08:12,708
but what if it's not?

89
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:15,508
Oi, shiny lady!

90
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:17,008
We're all ears.

91
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:19,408
So go on, spin us your tale.

92
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:21,508
How can we trust thee?

93
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:23,508
Who art thou, anyway?

94
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:26,508
I understand your skepticism.

95
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:29,508
In times like these, we all have our doubts.

96
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:31,208
My name is IRyssa.

97
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,508
I descended from the celestial realm on a holy quest...

98
00:08:34,508 --> 00:08:36,708
...to end the Dark Lord's reign.

99
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:40,808
‘Tis foretold that by vanquishing the Dark Lord,

100
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:43,108
one's heart's desires will be granted.

101
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,808
What dost thou mean by our heart's desire?

102
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:51,308
Each of you carries within you a longing that drives you.

103
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:55,208
This quest can make those aspirations a reality.

104
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:57,108
Have you any proof?

105
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:06,108
There.

106
00:09:06,108 --> 00:09:08,908
Now dost thou believe me?

107
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:11,208
Kora, what is wrong?

108
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,308
Thou lookest as though thou hast seen a ghost.

109
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:18,008
What witchcraft hast thou wrought upon her, foul enchantress?

110
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:21,308
I only showed her the truth.

111
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:23,708
Is this...

112
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,508
...the future?

113
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:26,708
Oh, one moment.

114
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,908
I shall return forthwith.

115
00:09:32,008 --> 00:09:32,808
Indeed, it—

116
00:09:32,808 --> 00:09:34,508
Where'd she go?

117
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,508
Aw, she shan't be gone long.

118
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:39,108
Watch, she'll return in on—

119
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:44,108
Though it may beggar belief,

120
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:45,808
IRyssa speaks the truth.

121
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:48,808
Our wishes can be granted.

122
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,108
Truly?

123
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:51,808
We can wish for anything?

124
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:53,808
Any wish.

125
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,308
Well then!

126
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:57,108
Wherefore do we tarry?

127
00:09:57,108 --> 00:09:59,008
Let us away!

128
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:13,642
(諦めない強さなら)
(If it's the strength to not give up)

129
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:19,485
(明日が見えないのなら)
(If tomorrow cannot be seen)

130
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:37,599
僕らは 迷ってた 真っ暗 狭い部屋
We were lost in a pitch-black, narrow room

131
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:43,316
僕らは あがいてた 光 差すほう
We were struggling towards where the light shines

132
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:48,899
不安や しがらみは 大きく膨らんで
Anxiety and entanglements grew larger

133
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:54,416
襲いかかる 逃げ場はない 差し伸べる手も
Attacking us, there's no escape, nor a hand reached out

134
00:10:54,416 --> 00:11:00,332
嫌というほどに 繰り返して
Repeating to a sickening degree

135
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:05,932
それでも まだまだ 与えるのか
Even so, will you still give more?

136
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,149
試練の日々よ
Oh, days of trial

137
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:15,166
諦めない強さなら それなりに平等だけど
If it's the strength to not give up,
it's somewhat equal

138
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:21,149
振り絞ったよ 今にもダメになりそう
I've squeezed it all out,
I'm about to break right now

139
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:27,249
そんなとき ふと見上げた 先駆者たちの言葉には
At such times, in the words of the pioneers
I happened to look up at

140
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:33,266
同じ香り 感じたんだ
I felt the same scent

141
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:47,399
僕らは 夢を見た さまざま 思い思い
We dreamed various, individual dreams

142
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:53,066
僕らは 賭けてみた お互いに全て
We tried betting everything on each other

143
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:58,566
勝率や現実 ときには振り払って
Shaking off the odds and reality at times

144
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:04,149
泣けばいい 悔めばいい 途中経過さ
It's okay to cry, it's okay to regret,
it's just a process

145
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:10,049
夢中で 息荒く 走り続け
Continuing to run breathlessly in a daze

146
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:15,766
気づけば 無数の 仲間たちに
Realizing that to the countless comrades

147
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:18,682
支えられながら
While being supported

148
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:25,149
明日がみえないのなら その方角は間違いさ
If tomorrow cannot be seen, that direction is wrong

149
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:30,999
一呼吸おいて ゼロからの近道もある
Take a breath,
there's also a shortcut from zero

150
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:36,666
簡単じゃないことでも 複雑に絡まる前に
Even things that aren't easy,
before they get tangled complexly

151
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:42,382
どうか一度 見せにおいで
Please come and show me once

152
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:57,099
出会ったんだ
We met

153
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:03,249
魅かれたんだ
We were enchanted

154
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:09,032
それが奇跡
That's a miracle

155
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:14,666
君にありがとう
Thank you to you

156
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:24,499
きっと諦めない強さなら それなりに平等だけど
Surely if it's the strength to not give up,
it's somewhat equal

157
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:30,399
振り絞ったよ 今にもダメになりそう
I've squeezed it all out,
I'm about to break right now

158
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:36,549
そんなとき ふと見上げた 先駆者たちの言葉には
At such times, in the words of the pioneers
I happened to look up at

159
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,482
頼らない 歌うよ
I won't rely on them, I'll sing

160
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:45,382
明日が見えないのなら その方角は間違いさ
If tomorrow cannot be seen, that direction is wrong

161
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:51,282
一呼吸おいて ゼロからの近道もある
Take a breath,
there's also a shortcut from zero

162
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:56,899
簡単じゃないことでも 複雑に絡まる前に
Even things that aren't easy,
before they get tangled complexly

163
00:13:57,099 --> 00:14:02,849
どうか一度 見せにおいで
Please come and show me once

164
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:40,016
Quite the jig ye have danced back at the tavern.

165
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:44,916
Was it to charm people or to scare away crows? I couldn't tell.

166
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:50,016
A brazen stone to cast when none would countenance you without your magic.

167
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:53,016
You're both very charming.

168
00:14:53,616 --> 00:14:56,016
But not as lovely as Namu.

169
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:56,816
Huh?

170
00:14:56,816 --> 00:14:58,316
Lovely you say?

171
00:14:58,716 --> 00:15:00,016
Is the moon not beautiful...

172
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,024
...for tonight.

173
00:15:01,344 --> 00:15:03,524
Although, we ought not linger.

174
00:15:03,924 --> 00:15:09,324
Rumor has it that an evil hag liveth in these parts.

175
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:13,524
And naught whets her appetite like the flesh of adventurers.

176
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,524
Thou art hiding something, we thinks.

177
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:23,024
What dost thou not want us to know about these woods?

178
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:26,024
Tell us more about this hag.

179
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:30,024
Aye, a frightful yarn doth excite my spirit!

180
00:15:30,824 --> 00:15:33,524
Ugh, can't you all see she speaks false?

181
00:15:35,324 --> 00:15:36,524
Ahem!

182
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:39,824
Gumi and her friend Darla

183
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:42,524
were adventurers who gathered fruit in these woods.

184
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:46,524
Gumi had heard of a trove of berries hidden deep in the forest,

185
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:51,024
so they ventured in and found a grove untouched by man or beast.

186
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:54,024
They began picking the berries in pure bliss.

187
00:15:54,024 --> 00:16:00,024
That is, until they heard a loud snapping and crunching sound.

188
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:01,624
What was that?!

189
00:16:01,824 --> 00:16:04,524
They looked around but saw nothing.

190
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:08,024
Spooked by the unnatural sound, they decided to leave.

191
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:11,524
But 'twas too late. They'd lost track of time.

192
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:15,024
Night had fallen, and darkness shrouded the woods.

193
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:18,524
They split up and marked their path with berries.

194
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:21,524
After some time, Gumi heard a scream

195
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:23,824
followed by a bone-chilling crunch.

196
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:28,024
Gumi ran down the berry trail with all the haste she could muster.

197
00:16:28,024 --> 00:16:32,024
The berries underfoot began to ooze a strange red substance.

198
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:36,024
It seeped into the ground, each stain bigger than the last.

199
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:40,024
Breathless, she came upon a large puddle of red.

200
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:43,024
And in the center, a pile of teeth.

201
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:48,024
Frozen in horror, she looked up and beheld a grotesque hag looming over her,

202
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:51,524
Darla's hair hanging from her mouth.

203
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:55,024
Before she could react, the hag lunged!

204
00:16:55,524 --> 00:17:00,024
How mean to rob us of any chance of peaceful slumber.

205
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:03,024
Merely trying to keep you all on your toes.

206
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:07,024
It's working. I don't think I'll sleep a wink tonight.

207
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:11,024
Let us abscond from this place.

208
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:13,524
Starting to feel like we're being watched.

209
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:15,524
Oh, wise choice.

210
00:17:16,024 --> 00:17:18,024
None of you belong here.

211

何かが始まる予感

258
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:31,532
The forest endears itself to me.

259
00:22:32,032 --> 00:22:37,532
Trees seem to whisper of endless paths and treasures untold.

260
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:40,532
What secrets dost thou hide?

261
00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:45,532
If I can keep us here longer, I might uncover these secrets.

262
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:51,532
Mayhaps with a little magic, a subtle persuasion, I could convince them.

263
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:57,032
It looks like we should be going this way, right?

264
00:22:57,532 --> 00:23:00,032
Mm, thou art mistaken. We can't go that way.

265
00:23:00,532 --> 00:23:04,032
Therein lies the lair of a bear, most fierce.

266
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:08,532
We must avoid it at all costs.

267
00:23:08,532 --> 00:23:10,032
We can handle a bear.

268
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:15,032
This is the shortest path. 'Twould remove us from this wood most expediently.

269
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:17,532
I know these woods well. Give me the map.

270
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:18,032
No.

271
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:19,532
Give it to me!

272
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:22,532
Thy tongue doth drip with deceit.

273
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:25,532
Why should we trust thee to lead the way?

274
00:23:25,532 --> 00:23:27,532
Perhaps I can lead us out.

275
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,032
The trees tell me of an easy and safe path.

276
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:31,532
The trees?

277
00:23:32,032 --> 00:23:34,532
Trees have no tongues, Fey-Lynn.

278
00:23:35,032 --> 00:23:39,032
Why don't we just go... that way?

279
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,532
Oh, but they do. Hearken well.

280
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:49,032
Vahire geleph, liarmí nor

00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:54,032

282
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:03,532
Fey-Lynn, what art thou...

283
00:24:04,032 --> 00:24:05,532
Oh.

284
00:24:05,532 --> 00:24:08,032
The forest is so beautiful.

285
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:10,032
I see it now.

286
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:15,032
Why are the trees so wiggly all of a sudden?

287
00:24:16,532 --> 00:24:18,532
Whoa!

288
00:24:19,532 --> 00:24:22,032
Avert thine eyes! The fireball is no friend.

289
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:24,032
Look at me!

290
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:27,532
I'm dancing with the forest spirits!

291
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:31,032
Be careful! Thou mightest turn into a tree.

292
00:24:31,532 --> 00:24:33,532
Really? Cool!

293
00:24:37,032 --> 00:24:38,532
What's in here?

294
00:24:38,532 --> 00:24:40,032
More secrets?

295
00:24:40,032 --> 00:24:41,532
Back off!

296
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:45,532
How dare thou layest thy grabby hands on my belongings!

297
00:24:45,532 --> 00:24:49,032
Dost thou mean to open a thrift shop with all this?

298
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:51,032
Aught is amiss with the leaves.

299
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,032
They're watching us.

300
00:24:54,532 --> 00:24:56,532
They aren't watching us.

301
00:24:56,532 --> 00:24:58,532
Merely judging thee.

302
00:24:58,532 --> 00:24:59,532
Take that!

303
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,390
Mechanical infiltrators?

304
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,840
Back, you fiends!

305
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,990
The hag!

306
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,240
Not my teas!

307
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,240
There's no hag.

308
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,140
The spell hath worked perfectly.
The spell has worked perfectly.

309
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,840
Look at the chaos I've created.

310
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,440
'Tis almost too easy.
It's almost too easy.

311
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,540
Alas, I had no choice.

312
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,040
They wanted to leave so soon.

313
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,640
Why would they want to miss out on the magic this forest holds?

314
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,540
Ah, do I manipulate them too much?

315
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,140
Nay, they will thank me for showing them the wonders of the forest.

316
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:42,540
The forest, however, is not nearly as magical as my beloved Namu.

317
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,240
She knows these woods so well.

318
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,340
I wonder why.

319
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,340
Every time she speaks, I can't help but be drawn to her.

320
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,240
I may have cast a spell on her...

321
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,390
...but 'tis she that hath enchanted me.
...but it is she who has enchanted me.

322
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,540
Follow me.

348
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,090
Finally!

349
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,590
We are out of those godforsaken woods.

350
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,190
Where is my bag?

351
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,590
I can't find it.

352
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,890
Thou must have mislaid it when we got lost.

353
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,390
Thou tookest it! Disown it not!

354
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,090
Don't play innocent.

355
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,890
Thy worthless baubles?

356
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,190
To what end?

357
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,590
I spied Fauna with the bag in the forest.

358
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,190
She probably took it.

359
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,390
Surely thou thinkest not that I would take...

360
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,190
...something of thine, Namu?

361
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,890
Nay, thou art right.

362
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,190
It would seem I need to replenish our funds again.

363
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,390
The bank must be missing my patronage right now.

364
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,190
I shan't keep them waiting.

365
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,890
I shall see if I can make some coin...

366
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,190
...performing at the local pub.

367
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,190
I need some peace and quiet.

368
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,390
Then I suppose I shall buy some herbs.

369
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,590
Look at her.

370
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,890
So perfect, so effortless.

371
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,690
Why, heaven, can I not be this perfect?

372
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,690
This beacon of grace doth mock my every stumble and fall.
This beacon of grace mocks my every stumble and fall.

373
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,890
What curse is it that I am condemned to live in this clumsy husk?

374
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,390
They laugh at my awkwardness...

375
00:29:55,390 --> 00:30:00,040
...but I despise it with every fiber of my being.

376
00:30:01,248 --> 00:30:03,948
'Tis a blight, a stain upon my soul.

377
00:30:04,348 --> 00:30:07,848
My ambitions can never reach their full potential in this state.

378
00:30:08,548 --> 00:30:12,548
How can I ever be taken seriously when I can't control my limbs?

379
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:17,548
I am a mockery, a joke to be pitied and scorned.

380
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:20,548
Oh, to possess such grace.

381
00:30:21,248 --> 00:30:24,248
I'd trade my soul for it.

382
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:30,848
Are there any devils I can trade my soul with to be as perfect as her?

383
00:30:31,848 --> 00:30:35,248
Would that it were so easy.

384
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,548
Oh my God

a fine flock of beauties the choir be.

00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:07,789
まだ君に好きだと言ってない
I haven't told you I love you yet.

540
00:41:55,414 --> 00:41:56,864
Ha...

541
00:41:56,864 --> 00:42:02,114
Why have I thought that I allowed myself to be walked into this quest?

542
00:42:02,114 --> 00:42:06,939
To suffer the odious hijinks of these bumbling fools.

543
00:42:06,939 --> 00:42:10,564
The crude, unsightly and boorish lot they are.

544
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:14,439
Me thinks they could scarce walk a straight line, much less perform.

545
00:42:14,439 --> 00:42:17,539
Or God forbid, dance.

546
00:42:18,314 --> 00:42:19,514
Ha...

547
00:42:19,514 --> 00:42:24,389
Their company doth abase me, who should be foremost among my peers.

548
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:29,564
Humble bard I may be, but the world shall soon know of my eminence.

549
00:42:29,564 --> 00:42:34,089
And fawn and adore me as they should.

550
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:36,064
I may yet be unknown.

551
00:42:36,064 --> 00:42:40,564
But soon, once this silly quest is over and I have my wish...

552
00:42:40,564 --> 00:42:44,339
Townfolk will swoon over my ballads.

553
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:47,514
Royalty will beg me to grace their parties.

554
00:42:47,514 --> 00:42:52,589
And the name of Hexa shall ring o'er hill and valley as the greatest performer this realm hath ever known.

555
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:56,614
And then... And then...

556
00:42:57,489 --> 00:43:00,714
The stage is open! For any who might wish to perform!

557
00:43:00,714 --> 00:43:05,489
Is there none who dare take the stage? What of you, Miss?

558
00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:09,589
I see thee tapping thy feet for the songs. Dost thou dance?

559
00:43:10,214 --> 00:43:13,189
Oh, me? Wha... I don't know.

560
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:15,614
Oh, please give us a song, Miss!

561
00:43:15,614 --> 00:43:18,314
It won't make us think I sing.

562
00:43:18,314 --> 00:43:21,214
Well, thou art dressed like a singer!

563
00:43:21,214 --> 00:43:25,139
So a singer's garbs doth a singer make?

564
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:28,064
Very well. I'll do it!

565
00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:30,989
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!

566
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:35,314
Are you ready for the greatest performance of your lives?

567
00:43:48,089 --> 00:43:52,514
Ah, ah...

568
00:43:54,439 --> 00:44:03,289
La-la-la-la-la...

569
00:44:04,164 --> 00:44:10,039
Once in a faraway, faraway world was a collar that coiled like a snake

570
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:13,064
I want someone please - I need someone please

571
00:44:13,064 --> 00:44:16,564
Oh, I listened close as it howled in ache

572
00:44:16,614 --> 00:44:19,514
Please don't be angry and please don't abandon me.

573
00:44:19,514 --> 00:44:22,514
Don't leave me here on my own (kay?)

574
00:44:22,564 --> 00:44:28,239
It wrapped itself tightly, daily and nightly - only with praise would it loosen it's hold

575
00:44:28,914 --> 00:44:32,039
I placed in the top of my class~

576
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:35,314
there's no one left for me to surpass

577
00:44:35,364 --> 00:44:38,264
Don't I look cute in this dress?

578
00:44:38,314 --> 00:44:41,214
I really, really...

579
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:44,289
Must confess - it's tightening 'round my neck!

580
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:47,439
Give me your love, all of your love,

581
00:44:47,439 --> 00:44:50,514
give me your love - all you can conjure up

582
00:44:50,514 --> 00:44:53,664
Give me your love, all of your love,

583
00:44:53,664 --> 00:44:56,864
till you go mad with ecstasy

584
00:44:56,914 --> 00:45:00,014
All of the hurt, all of the ache - help me escape! Take it, oh take it away!!!

585
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,372
All of the hurt, all of the ache -

586
00:45:01,372 --> 00:45:02,172
help me escape!

587
00:45:02,172 --> 00:45:06,672
Take it, oh take it away!!!

588
00:45:06,672 --> 00:45:10,172
Is there no end to this pain?

589
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:33,772
Ah...

590
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,172
Grow as you may

591
00:45:43,172 --> 00:45:46,872
but the necklace will stay just as small as the day it was found

592
00:45:46,872 --> 00:45:49,072
It's so suffocating, the endless placating -

593
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:53,472
no one is, no one is ever enough!

594
00:45:53,472 --> 00:45:56,572
Won't lose to anyone, always ranked number one,

595
00:45:56,572 --> 00:45:59,172
aren't I a beautiful child?

596
00:45:59,172 --> 00:46:00,072
(Hey,)

597
00:46:00,072 --> 00:46:01,372
I'm better than her -

598
00:46:01,372 --> 00:46:02,772
I'm better than him,

599
00:46:02,772 --> 00:46:06,172
oh everyone, come round and gawk at perfection!

600
00:46:06,172 --> 00:46:08,872
Meeting you right after school,

601
00:46:08,872 --> 00:46:12,372
I'm finally confessing to you

602
00:46:12,372 --> 00:46:15,472
Ain't it too good to be true?

603
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:16,472
Ah-ah!

604
00:46:16,472 --> 00:46:18,772
A girl, like me, in love with you -

605
00:46:18,772 --> 00:46:21,872
who's miserable, vulgar, and crude!

606
00:46:21,872 --> 00:46:24,472
Give me your love, all of your love, give me your love -

607
00:46:24,472 --> 00:46:27,772
You can have everything

608
00:46:27,772 --> 00:46:30,472
If I have you, I can have you -

609
00:46:30,472 --> 00:46:34,072
shoulder my load, now yours to behold

610
00:46:34,072 --> 00:46:36,572
Still not enough, you're not enough -

611
00:46:36,572 --> 00:46:38,872
never enough.

612
00:46:38,872 --> 00:46:44,272
Still I won't loosen my hold

613
00:46:44,272 --> 00:46:46,772
Truly, I'm so sorry.

614
00:46:46,772 --> 00:46:49,172
Give me your love, all of your love, give me your love -

615
00:46:49,172 --> 00:46:53,372
all you can conjure up

616
00:46:53,372 --> 00:46:55,472
Give me your love, all of your love -

617
00:46:55,472 --> 00:46:59,072
till you go mad with ecstasy

618
00:46:59,072 --> 00:47:00,672
I know it hurts -

619
00:47:00,672 --> 00:47:02,172
(it) only gets worse -

620
00:47:02,172 --> 00:47:03,972
God how it hurts -

621
00:47:03,972 --> 00:47:08,872
Soon you'll be craving the pain

622
00:47:08,872 --> 00:47:17,672
This is my happiness now!

623
00:47:33,272 --> 00:47:42,572
This is my happiness now!

624
00:48:13,272 --> 00:48:17,572
I know not how you fared, but I was successful in my venture.

625
00:48:17,572 --> 00:48:20,172
More trinkets for thy thrift shop?

626
00:48:20,172 --> 00:48:22,572
Uh, nay, 'twas coin we needed, was it not?

627
00:48:22,572 --> 00:48:27,772
I merely took out a small loan from the bank. They shan't mind.

628
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:30,072
I acquired some healing potions.

629
00:48:30,072 --> 00:48:35,472
Luckily, it was a simple matter to trade for some of these jewels I found in the woods.

630
00:48:35,472 --> 00:48:39,572
Thou liar! 'Twas thou who took my bag!

631
00:48:39,572 --> 00:48:41,572
Thou misapprehendest me!

632
00:48:41,572 --> 00:48:46,272
I merely found these lying on the floor of the forest.

633
00:48:46,272 --> 00:48:48,572
Perhaps there was a bag.

634
00:48:48,572 --> 00:48:50,572
Confess about stealing my stuff!

635
00:48:50,572 --> 00:48:54,672
Doth every bag that happens to fall in the wood belong to thee?

636
00:48:54,672 --> 00:48:57,672
IRyS is always acting selfishly.

637
00:48:57,672 --> 00:48:59,872
She's the newest, so 'twas probably her.

638
00:48:59,872 --> 00:49:02,172
Thou darest to accuse me!

639
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:06,172
If thou wert truly innocent, would the thief not more likely be Hakos?

640
00:49:06,172 --> 00:49:11,472
She is simple and craven, and acted half-mad back there in the forest.

641
00:49:11,472 --> 00:49:14,672
Me? Why art thou accusing me?

642
00:49:14,672 --> 00:49:18,472
It could be none but Ouro with a strange obsession with Namu.

643
00:49:18,472 --> 00:49:20,172
Thy words ring true.

644
00:49:20,172 --> 00:49:23,272
Can I just have the bag thou foundest in the forest?

645
00:49:23,272 --> 00:49:24,472
Nay, 'tis mine!

646
00:49:26,572 --> 00:49:30,172
I knew 'twas folly to undertake this quest with you all!

647
00:49:30,172 --> 00:49:33,872
Fie on you! Fie on you all!

648
00:49:33,872 --> 00:49:37,772
Most of all on thee, that wanton and witless womanizer.

649
00:49:37,772 --> 00:49:41,572
I saw thy pathetic attempts at charming innocent choir girls.

650
00:49:41,572 --> 00:49:47,572
Better to apply thy sorcery upon thyself, that thou might vanish to the betterment of the world.

651
00:49:48,072 --> 00:49:52,072
Me? My romantic diversions serve no concern to thee,

652
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,872
thou uncouth mud-cake field rat.

653
00:49:54,872 --> 00:49:59,872
Dost thou and thy companions of flesh...

654
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,880
...and trees.

655
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,680
Have you all forgotten about our quest?

656
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,380
Why art thou in such rush to go?

657
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,580
Didst thou steal it?

658
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,580
Certainly not.

659
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:15,380
I only want us to continue our quest and not linger on this useless bickering.

660
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:19,480
You two have been fighting or sticking to each other this whole time.

661
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,380
Make up your mind already!

662
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:22,980
Do you like each other?

663
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,780
We like each other.

664
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,480
Do we not, Namu?

665
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:30,280
If 'twas thou who stole my bag, then no, I don't like thee.

666
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,780
Really?

667
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,580
Look what thou hast done, thou sodden-witted cur!

668
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,680
Thou hast wounded her!

670
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:48,580
時の揺りかごで
In time's cradle

671
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,480
冷たい夢を見る
I see a cold dream

672
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,580
君が歌ってくれた
You sang for me

673
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,680
愛しい　愛しい　子守唄
A lovely, lovely lullaby

674
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,580
君が望んだのは？
What you desired was...?

675
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,780
―終わらぬ世界―
...an endless world?

676
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,180
俺が望むのは
What I desire is...

677
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,780
―世界の終わり...？―
...the world's end...?

678
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,780
選ばれし声は
The chosen voices are...

679
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,780
迷い、憂い、微笑み、労わり歌う
wandering, grieving, smiling, caring, and singing.

680
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,580
悲しみを　苦しみを　喜びに　笑顔に変えて
Changing sadness and suffering into joy and smiles,

681
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,180
報われずに　君は朽ちていくの？
Will you decay without being rewarded?

682
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:24,180
―ただ、祈る―
I just pray...

683
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,580
救いたい、ただ君だけを
I want to save only you,

684
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,580
守りたい、この世界を
I want to protect this world.

685
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,480
想いは　変わらない
My feelings will not change.

686
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:39,880
巡り巡る世界に　やすらぎと祝福を―
May there be peace and blessings for this cycle of worlds.

687
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,180
命を　この手で全て、終わらせたい
I want to end all life with my own hands.

688
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:43,080
ああ　届かない
Ah, it doesn't reach.

689
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,080
―伝わらないよ―
...It's not being conveyed.

690
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:48,380
願いは虚しさだけを残して
My wishes only leave emptiness behind.

691
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,880
何故？　全て奪われ
Why? Everything was taken away...

692
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,380
―未来を照らして―
...light up the future.

693
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:56,280
痛み、苦しみ、背負わされても...
Even if I am burdened with pain and suffering...

694
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,280
―永遠に続くレクイエム―
...an eternally continuing requiem.

695
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,880
抗えない運命を
In the face of an unavoidable fate,

696
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,880
―光を、運命を―
...the light, the fate.

697
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,980
全て今、解き放つ
I release it all now,

698
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,980
―闇を　解き放つ―
...release the darkness.

699
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,280
君が望んだのは？
What you desired was...?

700
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,280
―あなたの未来―
...your future.

701
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:42,380
俺が望んだのは...何故？
What I desired was... why?

702
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,380
―戻らぬあの日...？―
...those days that won't return...?

703
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,380
追い続けたのは　優しい笑顔
What I kept chasing was your gentle smile.

704
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,280
それだけなのに
It was only that,

705
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,680
―終わらない歌声を―
...an unending singing voice.

706
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,680
絶望を、希望に変えて
Changing despair into hope,

707
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,780
叫び続けて
Keep screaming,

708
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,780
―滅びる運命なら―
...if it's a fate to perish.

709
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,780
せめて今、弔いの
At least now, for a funeral...

710
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,780
―ただ、祈る―
I just pray...

711
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,180
果てしなく　遠く遠く―
Endlessly far, far away.

712
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,880
歌よ　響け
Let my song resound!

713
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:14,680
巡り巡る世界に　やすらぎと祝福を
May there be peace and blessings for this cycle of worlds.

714
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:20,680
光を、運命を、闇を、解き放って
Release the light, the fate, and the darkness.

715
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,480
終わらない絶望を
Endless despair...

716
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,480
―歌声を、希望に変えて―
...changing the singing voice into hope.

717
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,780
報われずに　君は朽ちていくの？
Will you decay without being rewarded?

718
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,780
―叫び続けて　ただ祈る―
...keep screaming and just pray.

719
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,780
せめて今、弔いの
At least now, for a funeral...

720
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,480
果てしなく、遠く遠く―
Endlessly far, far away.

721
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,580
歌よ　響け
Let my song resound!

722
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,680
君が望んだのは？
What you desired was...?

723
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,580
俺が望んだのは...
What I desired was...

724
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:49,180
残された声は　嘆き　君を想いながら
The remaining voices, grieving while thinking of you.

725
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:56,580
独り、君のために歌う
I sing alone for you.

726
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:02,480
命を　この手で全て、眠らせたら
If I put all life to sleep with these hands,

727
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:05,180
―巡り巡る世界に　やすらぎと祝福を―
...then may there be peace and blessings for this cycle of worlds.

728
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,880
ああ、朽ちていく　運命は終わり
Ah, decaying. Fate is over.

729
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:12,380
この身は　君とならどこまででも...
With you, I can go anywhere...

730
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,880
はじまる声　全て叶えて
The beginning voice, grant everything.

731
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,880
―未来を照らして―
...light up the future.

732
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:19,480
滅び、散りゆく　この身とともに
Along with this body that will perish and scatter,

733
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,480
―永遠に続くレクイエム―
...an eternally continuing requiem.

734
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,080
抗えない運命を
In the face of an unavoidable fate,

735
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:23,080
―光を、運命を―
...the light, the fate.

736
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:26,180
すべて今、解き放ち
I release it all now,

737
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,180
―闇を解き放ち―
...release the darkness.

738
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:33,580
光の底に、眠れ
Sleep in the depth of the light.

739
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,880
Where is the Dark Lord?

740
00:55:01,138 --> 00:55:02,588
Dark Lord, reveal thyself!

741
00:55:02,588 --> 00:55:04,288
We are here to defeat thee!

742
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:09,188
Huh? How queer.

743
00:55:10,438 --> 00:55:11,888
The silence... it's...

744
00:55:13,388 --> 00:55:15,188
...as if this room was empty...

745
00:55:16,088 --> 00:55:17,988
...from the very beginning.

746
00:55:18,988 --> 00:55:20,388
Might it be?

Our Promise (Remix ver.)
Lyrics: noire
Music, Arrangement: Jeremy Robson

748
00:55:52,688 --> 00:55:56,188
The quest began at the cusp of dawn

749
00:55:59,088 --> 00:56:02,588
Blank map in hand eager to be drawn

750
00:56:03,588 --> 00:56:05,588
Cascading secrets

751
00:56:06,588 --> 00:56:09,588
Holding onto wishes untold

752
00:56:10,588 --> 00:56:15,288
With every stride, a new tale bound to unfold

753
00:56:19,588 --> 00:56:21,888
In realms never seen

754
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:24,888
In planes beyond belief

755
00:56:25,888 --> 00:56:30,388
Smiles beamed and gleamed radiantly

756
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:34,588
Wonders hidden with each turn

757
00:56:35,438 --> 00:56:37,088
Always together

758
00:56:37,888 --> 00:56:43,088
In harmony, all perils can be weathered

759
00:56:45,388 --> 00:56:49,288
A melody chases the laughter of five

760
00:56:50,588 --> 00:56:54,888
Through days like forests deep and wide

761
00:56:57,088 --> 00:56:58,388
When paths diverge

762
00:56:58,588 --> 00:57:02,388
We meet again where dreams converge

763
00:57:02,888 --> 00:57:05,388
Hear our hearts collide

764
00:57:05,888 --> 00:57:08,188
Fears out of sight

765
00:57:08,888 --> 00:57:11,388
Stars ever bright

766
00:57:13,588 --> 00:57:17,588
Our promise ignites

767
00:57:33,388 --> 00:57:37,088
Hours slip by with familiar song

768
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:42,588
Twilight's glow, the shadow's gone

769
00:57:43,888 --> 00:57:46,088
Exchanging secrets

770
00:57:47,388 --> 00:57:50,088
Knowing the power they behold

771
00:57:51,088 --> 00:57:55,588
With every change, an old tale passed to be told

772
00:57:56,888 --> 00:57:59,088
In trails never walked

773
00:57:59,888 --> 00:58:02,388
In lands beyond one's thought

774
00:58:03,388 --> 00:58:07,888
Lessons taught in destinies sought

775
00:58:09,588 --> 00:58:12,388
Echoes of the world unknown

776
00:58:13,388 --> 00:58:14,988
Searching for treasures

777
00:58:15,588 --> 00:58:20,588
In harmony, our souls steadily tremor

778
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:31,588
A melody chases the laughter of five

779
00:58:32,588 --> 00:58:37,388
Through nights like sand burying time

780
00:58:38,888 --> 00:58:40,288
When paths diverge

781
00:58:40,588 --> 00:58:44,388
We meet here where our dreams surge

782
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:47,388
Hear our hearts collide

783
00:58:47,888 --> 00:58:50,188
Fears out of sight

784
00:58:50,888 --> 00:58:53,388
Stars ever bright

785
00:58:55,588 --> 00:59:00,088
Our promise ignites

786
01:02:58,596 --> 01:03:26,411
The Broken Promise
