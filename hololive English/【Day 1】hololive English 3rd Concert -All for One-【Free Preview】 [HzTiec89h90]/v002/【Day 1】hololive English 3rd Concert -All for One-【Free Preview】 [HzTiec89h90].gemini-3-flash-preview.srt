So let the good times roll

163
00:38:09,356 --> 00:38:12,656
Every time that I'm with you

164
00:38:12,656 --> 00:38:16,056
I could swear it's like a wish is coming true

165
00:38:16,056 --> 00:38:19,456
So I believe in you if you believe in me

166
00:38:19,456 --> 00:38:22,856
Together we can chase all our dreams

167
00:38:23,056 --> 00:38:24,056
One, two, three, four, five!

168
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:27,456
When our voices in hearts unite,
we're gonna shine bright

169
00:38:27,456 --> 00:38:30,856
Together we're all for one,
let's sing! All for one!

170
00:38:30,856 --> 00:38:34,056
The thrill of happiness is all around us

171
00:38:34,056 --> 00:38:37,656
Jump in 'cause it's all for one,
let's sing! All for one!

172
00:38:38,256 --> 00:38:41,656
We're on our way to good times, good vibes

173
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:45,256
We'll treasure this day,
the rest of our lives (Hey!)

174
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:48,656
All that we waited for,
the dream we're striving toward

175
00:38:48,656 --> 00:38:51,656
We're singing all for one! All for one!

176
00:39:46,356 --> 00:39:48,556
Time to open up your eyes

177
00:39:48,556 --> 00:39:50,556
Hear the music start to rise

178
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:53,356
Got to break the world and let me in

179
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:02,564
Livin' my life out loud

180
00:40:04,264 --> 00:40:08,564
I have awakened to wisdom beyond understanding

181
00:40:10,064 --> 00:40:13,564
I keep advancing in my abandonment

182
00:40:15,564 --> 00:40:18,064
Oh oh oh

183
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:22,064
Don't blame me if I shine too bright

184
00:40:22,564 --> 00:40:24,464
Oh oh oh

185
00:40:24,664 --> 00:40:28,464
Can't help it if I start a fight

186
00:40:28,964 --> 00:40:30,864
Oh oh oh

187
00:40:31,064 --> 00:40:35,064
Now pay attention 'cause this is only the beginning

188
00:40:35,464 --> 00:40:37,464
It's our genesis!

189
00:40:37,664 --> 00:40:39,964
Come and see, break some habit

190
00:40:40,164 --> 00:40:42,264
How do you like this bad news?

191
00:40:42,464 --> 00:40:44,664
I'm embracing my madness

192
00:40:45,064 --> 00:40:46,564
Can you hear it?

193
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:51,564
Whispers are banging down your window

194
00:40:51,864 --> 00:40:54,064
Rumors reaching a crescendo

195
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:58,364
No humble beginning, I'm destined for great things

196
00:40:58,564 --> 00:41:01,164
I'm sure you've heard of me by now

197
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:08,564
Midnight, drive me to the dark side

198
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:13,064
Daylight, take me on a joyride

199
00:41:13,264 --> 00:41:15,864
My crime is my passion

200
00:41:16,064 --> 00:41:18,464
I may have in action

201
00:41:18,664 --> 00:41:21,264
I know what day it is

202
00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:25,064
This is our genesis!

203
00:41:25,864 --> 00:41:28,664
Ah, ah, ah

204
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:32,464
You can start a wave when I misbehave, take center stage

205
00:41:32,864 --> 00:41:35,664
Ah, ah, ah

206
00:41:35,864 --> 00:41:39,464
At the box office, but you know I'm gonna get insane

207
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:42,264
No holds on smokin'

208
00:41:42,464 --> 00:41:44,864
The rules can all be broken

209
00:41:45,064 --> 00:41:47,664
And running on a rampage

210
00:41:47,864 --> 00:41:50,064
The world is a blank page

211
00:41:50,264 --> 00:41:51,364
Let's go!

212
00:41:51,564 --> 00:41:55,364
I'm writing my story in flames and in glory

213
00:41:55,564 --> 00:41:59,064
They're gonna know me by name

214
00:41:59,464 --> 00:42:02,364
Ah, ah, ah

215
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:05,164
Is this my bottom line?

216
00:42:05,464 --> 00:42:08,364
Ah, ah, ah

217
00:42:08,564 --> 00:42:11,164
The future's in my hand

218
00:42:11,464 --> 00:42:14,364
Ah, ah, ah

219
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:17,164
But they don't understand

220
00:42:17,464 --> 00:42:22,464
That I'm designing, making, awaking and taking

221
00:42:22,664 --> 00:42:24,364
Around, round, round, round

222
00:42:24,564 --> 00:42:27,264
Tell me how you like me now

223
00:42:29,864 --> 00:42:31,064
Come on!

224
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:35,264
Shout! Shout! Shout! Shout!

225
00:42:37,864 --> 00:42:39,064
Come on!

226
00:42:40,364 --> 00:42:45,364
Can you watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me

227
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:49,664
Let your voice go, gonna show you how to lose control

228
00:42:49,864 --> 00:42:51,464
Ready?

229
00:42:51,664 --> 00:42:53,864
You got the 3, 2, 1

230
00:42:54,064 --> 00:42:56,664
Keep your restraint on high

231
00:42:56,864 --> 00:43:00,164
Be outrageous, the chaos is contagious

232
00:43:00,364 --> 00:43:03,464
Come on, you know what time it is

233
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,764
It's our genesis!

234
00:43:05,964 --> 00:43:09,864
Open up your eyes, feel the music start to rise

235
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:14,164
Got to break the world and let me in

236
00:43:14,364 --> 00:43:16,764
Point to who was meant to be

237
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:18,964
Living life so fast and free

238
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:21,164
Try to keep your eyes on me

239
00:43:21,364 --> 00:43:23,364
As this is our beginning

240
00:43:23,664 --> 00:43:25,664
It's our genesis!

241
00:43:25,864 --> 00:43:29,864
Whispers are banging down your window

242
00:43:30,164 --> 00:43:32,564
Rumors reaching a crescendo

243
00:43:32,764 --> 00:43:36,864
No humble beginning, I'm destined for great things

244
00:43:37,064 --> 00:43:39,764
I'm sure you've heard of me by now

245
00:43:43,064 --> 00:43:46,964
Midnight, drive me to the dark side

246
00:43:47,264 --> 00:43:51,464
Daylight, take me on a joyride

247
00:43:51,664 --> 00:43:54,164
My crime is my passion

248
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:56,764
Our urban extraction

249
00:43:56,964 --> 00:43:59,664
I know what day it is

250
00:43:59,864 --> 00:44:03,464
This is our genesis!

251
00:44:03,864 --> 00:44:06,064
It's our genesis!

252
00:44:06,364 --> 00:44:08,464
Tell me what time it is

253
00:44:08,764 --> 00:44:10,864
It's our genesis!

254
00:44:11,164 --> 00:44:13,464
Yeah, you know what time it is

255
00:44:13,764 --> 00:44:15,864
It's our genesis!

256
00:44:16,164 --> 00:44:18,264
Tell me what time it is

257
00:44:18,564 --> 00:44:21,664

00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:39,072
I can't hear you!

You know, I can't believe it's already the third live!

309
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:10,130

311
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:15,830

We're just getting started.
We need to test those penlights!

329
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,030
Yeah, test the penlights!

330
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,530
See if they work!

331
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:06,030
How about we split down the middle here?

332
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:07,530
Split down the middle.

333
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:11,030
And we go... Violet... no, not Purple... Violet here!

00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:34,030
And yeah, you know... not only that,
we're just getting started.

342
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:37,030

353
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:04,530
She's excited, but it's not... it's kind of sad because...

354
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,530
...it is now time to announce that...

355
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:09,530
