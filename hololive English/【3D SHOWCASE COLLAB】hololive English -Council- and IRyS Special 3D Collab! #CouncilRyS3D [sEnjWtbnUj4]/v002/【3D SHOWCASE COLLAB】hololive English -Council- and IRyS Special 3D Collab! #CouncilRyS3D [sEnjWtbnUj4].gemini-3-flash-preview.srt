00:00:00,001 --> 00:02:46,000
SPECIAL COLLAB

3
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,450
We're ready to greet the world

4
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,200
We're voyaging forward with courage to run toward a brand new start

5
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,200
Let's go live, bridging the distance across the sea endlessly

6
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,500
Cheerfully meeting heart to heart

7
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Connect the World

8
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,900
Waking from a dream, stepped into a stream

9
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,800
I make a wish and wait for my cue

10
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,200
How will we connect in this new frontier we're journeying through?

11
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,200
Like in a scene where no one's ever been

12
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,900
With vibrant colors bursting like stars

13
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,800
Radiant and warm, cosmic energy that's carried us this far

14
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,400
Each new debut brings a miracle to life

15
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,900
Surely we've gotta take that chance

16
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,800
We're running non-stop straight to the top, that's right!

17
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,300
We're ready to change the game

18
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,000
A shimmering showcase creating a new place where we can shine

19
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,700
Day by day, sparkling stories will intertwine

20
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,750
Get ready to cross the waves

21
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,000
We're voyaging forward with courage to run toward a brand new stage

22
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,700
Let's go live, bridging the distance across the sea endlessly

23
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,900
Follow me and we'll turn the page

24
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,300
Breaking through the doubt we know

25
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Figure out a way to clear each towering trial

26
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:41,400
Sharing all our hopes, we can conquer any challenge with a smile

27
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,450
We'll link our hearts as we search across the globe

28
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,900
Knowing no matter where we are, no matter how far

29
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,900
We can be stars, let's go!

30
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:10,833
I want to chase a wish unwaveringly

31
00:05:11,073 --> 00:05:14,173
Playing out this grand story

32
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:17,483
Share the future stars we can see

33
00:05:17,713 --> 00:05:19,783
Making them reality

34
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:23,083
Take my hand and reach for the sky

35
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,443
All we need are glittering dreams

36
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:29,733
A heart and soul, all fulfilled

37
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,583
In the world we build

38
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,833
We're ready to seize the day

39
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,443
Traversing the pathways

40
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:40,133
Discovering highways to everywhere

41
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:41,983
Step by step

42
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:45,083
Gathering stories that we can share

43
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,983
Get ready to lead the way

44
00:05:46,983 --> 00:05:48,673
With each generation

45
00:05:48,673 --> 00:05:51,733
The shining sensation, a dream unfurled

46
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,213
Let's make friends

47
00:05:53,213 --> 00:05:56,383
Picking a moment of history

48
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:57,983
Joyfully

49
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,583
Follow me

50
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:03,183
We'll connect the world

51
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:05,083
You'll hear our song

52
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,383
Ringing out over hills and oceans

53
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:13,383
Our legend grows and continues

54
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:17,983
We'll carry on, starting now

55
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:21,383
Setting hearts in motion

56
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:25,883
Connecting all of the world

57
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:39,733
Yay!

58
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,183
Guys!

59
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:45,183
You good? You good?

60
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:46,883
Yeah, very great. Okay.

00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:48,683
We're all in 3D together!

62
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:51,683
Yay!

63
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:54,333
All right, let's introduce each of these beautiful ladies.

64
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:57,383
Hi-RyS! It's IRyS from Hololive English.

00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:02,833

75
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,183
Swag!

76
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,783
Oh, hi.

77
00:07:32,983 --> 00:07:37,083
I'm Nanashi Mumei, and I'm mooming in 3D. Hello!

00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:40,733

Yay! We're finally in 3D together!

84
00:07:58,183 --> 00:08:00,983
We just finished singing our first song together.

85
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:03,443
It was "Connect the World,"

86
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:06,443
Hololive English's idol song,

87
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:09,443
and I'm so happy I was able to sing

88
00:08:09,643 --> 00:08:11,583
with all of you guys today in 3D.

89
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,183
That was just our first song.

90
00:08:13,383 --> 00:08:15,443
We still have a lot in store for you.

91
00:08:15,643 --> 00:08:17,183
Stuff you would never expect.

92
00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:19,783
Oh? Could it be? 何?
Oh? Could it be? What?

93
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,183
How are you liking it so far?

94
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:24,443
It's pretty good. It's great. Yeah.

95
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:26,883
You guys like it? I love it personally.

96
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,733
Yeah, we love it. It's great. Love!

97
00:08:30,983 --> 00:08:32,783
Even if you dislike,

98
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:34,083
be sure to smash that like button!

99
00:08:34,283 --> 00:08:36,883
Smash! Smash it! Smash it!

100
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,183
But don't just smash that like button.

101
00:08:39,383 --> 00:08:42,183
Be sure to talk about what you think

102
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:44,083
using the hashtag #CouncilRyS3D

103
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:46,883
because we want to hear your thoughts, man.

104
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:52,643
Yeah! Use the hashtag! Use the hashtag! Use it!

105
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:57,183
The hashtag might be #CouncilRyS3D...

106
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:01,683
...but that might not matter too much anymore.

107
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:04,483
What? Oh?

108
00:09:04,683 --> 00:09:09,383

Yay!

117
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:43,383
So in celebration of our newly formed official unit,

00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,383
HoloPromise, today we're going to promise

119

to sing many songs, play many games,

120
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:51,883
and celebrate being together in 3D.

121
00:09:54,983 --> 00:09:56,083
You guys ready?

122
00:09:56,283 --> 00:09:57,783

Yay!

125
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:03,845
Well, we're gonna go get ready

126
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:05,745
and start off with the first game.

127
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:08,095
So everybody, exit stage right!

128
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:40,645
Now Loading...

129
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:53,645
Yee-haw! Welcome everyone to the Promise Games!

130
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:56,645
Promise Games

131
00:10:57,845 --> 00:11:01,245
Now, well, you know, since IRyS has joined us

132
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,445
to create Promise,

133
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,745
we present to you with the Promise Games.

134
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:08,045
We're gonna figure out who's really on top.

135
00:11:08,045 --> 00:11:09,645
Number one!

136
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,345
I promise you, I'll be first. Number one.

137
00:11:13,745 --> 00:11:15,945
I promise you, she'll be first.

138
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:17,445
I'm gonna be the top.

139
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,445
I promise you, not bottom.

140
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:22,045
Someone will be first,

141
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:23,845
someone will be bottom.

142
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:29,045
We're gonna battle through different games today,

143
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:31,845
and whoever has the most points at the end

144
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:34,045
will be the champion of said Promise Games.

145
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:35,445
Everyone okay?

146
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,645
Yeah! Okay!

147
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:41,145
So, if we're okay, I would actually like to

148
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:43,645
explain the very first game that we're gonna play today.

149
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:45,945
Alrighty!

150
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:47,445
The first game will be...

151
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:48,945
everyone knows this game...

152
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:50,745
Red light, Green light!

153
00:11:53,945 --> 00:11:55,845
Now, look behind you everyone.

154
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:58,545
Actually no, look in front of you.

155
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:01,645
Look, look, look what's in front of us right now.

156
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:05,245
Oh my god! Look at this beautiful obstacles course!

157
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:09,145
Yes! This isn't just your regular Red Light, Green Light.

158
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,445
Whoever can avoid the obstacles and touch the goal

159
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:14,945
will earn one point!

160
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:24,645
Okay, and if you're caught by the Oni,

161
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:28,145
you'll have to stay on the course and crawl for the rest of the round.

162
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:31,145
And you don't just crawl, you can...

163
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:34,645
you can babubu babu and... sabotage!

164
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:37,145
Sabotage! Oh!

165
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:40,145
Alrighty, so let's go through the details of the course.

166
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:41,645
First is the Balance Beam.

167
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:44,845
Pass this obstacle by crossing over without falling.

168
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:46,145
Yes, the usual.

169
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:49,145
Balance Beam Course

170
00:12:46,645 --> 00:12:49,145
Oh gosh, flashbacks...

171
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:52,145
And then after that, there is the bar, the limbo bar.

172
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:55,445
You pass this obstacle by crossing under the bar limbo style.

173
00:12:52,645 --> 00:13:00,645
Bar Course

174
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:57,145
Flexibility! Let's go!

175
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:59,145
I'm stiff like a stick.

176
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:05,145
And last! After the limbo, we have the tires.

177
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:14,645
Tire Course

178
00:13:08,945 --> 00:13:12,445
You pass this obstacle by jumping across using the tires with one leg.

179
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:14,945
You hop, hop. Okay? Yeah, hop.

180
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:19,145
Okay, and we have a special guest today to play the part of the Oni.

181
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:23,145
Let's introduce her, here she is!

182
00:13:24,245 --> 00:13:25,645
Hello!

183
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:28,145
A-chan!

184
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:37,145
You're so soft! Why are you so cushy?

185
00:13:37,145 --> 00:13:38,845
I'm so squishy!

186
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:42,645
I lost my power because of overtime.

187
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:47,145
Overtime! Oh no! She can't be superhuman anymore.

188
00:13:47,945 --> 00:13:52,145
Anyway, congratulations on your 3D! Yay!

189
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:55,445
And thank you for inviting me back.

190
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:59,145
But today, I'm a strict, scary Oni.

191
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:03,645
Oh no! We're in trouble. Yeah, looks very scary.

192
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,145
You look very soft. I want to use you as my couch.

193
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:09,145
I want to sit.

194
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:13,145
No, no sit! Sit on... I'm only flat. Don't push me!

195
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:19,145
Well, we have this very cute Oni here today. Yeah, cute.

196
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:21,645
Yes, so is everyone ready to play?

197
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:22,945
Okay! Let's get...

198
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,645
...Red Light, Green Light started!

199
00:14:29,145 --> 00:14:31,645
We decided on the order beforehand with rock paper scissors, so...

200
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:33,045
I won!

201
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:34,445
Yes, we won, I won! She won!

202
00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:37,645
Alright, we play! Are we ready?

203
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:39,845
Let's go! We play, we play.

204
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,145
Ready, set, go!

205
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:45,445
Green light!

206
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:47,445
Red light!

207
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:49,445
Green light!

208
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:50,745
Red light!

209
00:14:50,745 --> 00:14:52,145
IRyS out!

210
00:14:52,945 --> 00:14:54,445
Okay...

211
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,445
Green light!

212
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:58,445
Red light!

213
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:00,645
Green light!

214
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,458
무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다
Red light, green light, 1, 2, 3.

215
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:04,758
I'm out!

216
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,458
(Screaming and baby noises)

217
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,458
Babu! Babies! Babu!

218
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,958
Babu! Babus! Mumei!

219
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,458
Oh, you were so, so weird!

220
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,458
Weak!

221
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,958
I'm not weak!

222
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:23,158
Red light.

223
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:24,958
Green light.

224
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,458
Wait, wait!

225
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,958
So many babies out there.

226
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,958
Babu, babu, babu!

227
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,458
Mama Mumei! Green light!

228
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:38,958
Red light.

229
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,158
Green light.

230
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,958
Babu, babu. Oh!

231
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,458
I'm going slow.

232
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:48,958
Oh, she's listening.

233
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:50,758
She's... okay, she's listening.

234
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,458
Red light!

235
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,458
I win! I win!

236
00:15:57,158 --> 00:16:00,458
Alrighty, since we all didn't make it, we're doing one more.

237
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,958
Doing one more! One more!

238
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,958
Wanna switch order this time?

239
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:11,758
It's so easy for you.

240
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,458
Go same order? Same order?

241
00:16:13,758 --> 00:16:16,458
Okay. Alright, right, right.

242
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,958
Okay, are you ready?

243
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,758
Ready! Let's go!

244
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,458
Green light.

245
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:23,958
Red light.

246
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:25,958
Green light.

247
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,458
Red light.

248
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,958
Mmm... nothing.

249
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,458
Green light.

250
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:35,458
Red light.

251
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,458
Mommy! Mommy! I'm out!

252
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,958
Green light.

253
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,958
Red light. Ah, I win!

254
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,958
Dammit! Okay, okay. Green light.

255
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,958
Goo goo ga ga.

256
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:53,458
Red light! Babu!

257
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,458
Oh, almost!

258
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,458
Goo goo!

259
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,458
Green light.

260
00:16:58,758 --> 00:16:59,958
Red light! I'm watching you!

261
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,958
I'm watching you!

262
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,958
Baby! You're almost... almost...

263
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,958
Mama! Mommy!

264
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,458
Red light!

265
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,458
Green light! Green light!

266
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:16,458
Red light! Ah! You're out!

267
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,458
Bae! Dammit!

268
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,958
Dammit! Ah, nice game, nice game.

269
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,458
So amazing, you guys were doing great!

270
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,758
It was just a light tap. Okay, sure.

271
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,458
Alrighty, as the game is over, congrats Bae for winning! Yay!

272
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,958
Congratulations! We, a lot of us crawled a lot today.

273
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,458
Yeah.

274
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:54,958
But it's still too early to tell who's gonna win the Promise Games.

275
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,458
We still have a lot more.

276
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,458
Alrighty, thank you so much A-chan for being our seeker!

277
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,958
Thank you A-chan! No! Stay away!

278
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,958
She's touching me! Touching me! Touching me!

279
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:13,958
Alright, see you in the next game! Bye!

280
00:18:45,958 --> 00:19:15,958
Now Loading...

281
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,958
Oh! What? We made it to the next game arena!

282
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,958
Yay!

283
00:19:28,158 --> 00:19:30,958
And I'm here to introduce the next game,

284
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:34,458
which will be the Meteo Smash Challenge!

285
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,458
Smash! Smash! Smash!

286
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,958
But we're not the ones who will be smashing.

287
00:19:40,158 --> 00:19:41,758
We're smashing?

288
00:19:42,158 --> 00:19:45,158
No, no. We're in great peril today.

289
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,958
But it'll be easier to show you than to tell.

290
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,458
So everyone please, please spread out to your designated areas.

291
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,958
Spread out! Okay.

292
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,458
Spreading out. Spreading out.

293
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,958
And from the heavens appears... oh!

294
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:03,371
Another square meteorite!

295
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:04,671
That's a meteor!

296
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:12,571
Is everyone alive in there?

297
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,971
I'm alive! Hello!

298
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:18,071
Still 3D! Still 3D, not flattened.

299
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:19,771
I'm not pancake.

300
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:24,271
As long as you make it through one of these holes
in the meteorite, you will survive.

301
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:28,271
Anyone who avoids the meteorites all the way through earns a point!

302
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:29,271
However, the game becomes more difficult as time
goes on because there'll be fewer and fewer holes.

303
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:33,571
The game goes until there's only one person left.

304
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:35,771
We might have time to play a few rounds.

305
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:38,271
And no sharing! No sharing your holes!

306
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,671
So if anybody's...

307
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:43,071
If push comes to shove, we shove.

308
00:20:43,371 --> 00:20:44,271
We shove.

309
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:46,071
Shove. Okay, gotcha.

310
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,571
Alright, everybody understand?

311
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:50,071
Yeah! I understand!

312
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:51,771
Alright! Let's start!

313
00:20:51,871 --> 00:20:52,871
Ready!

314
00:20:52,971 --> 00:20:54,571
Everybody ready?

315
00:21:04,371 --> 00:21:05,771
I'm in! Right? I'm in! I'm in!

316
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:08,771
I think we all survived!

317
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:10,071
Oh my hair!

318
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,071
Okay, next one!

319
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:26,771
Hi! How many times is the meteor
going to land on us?

320
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:31,071
And then... it's a viciously square meteorite.

321
00:21:31,671 --> 00:21:32,771
We're alive.

322
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:34,571
All natural.

323
00:21:43,771 --> 00:21:45,471
Goodbye! Goodbye! I'm sorry!

324
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:51,071
Oh no, it was so fast!

325
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:54,471
I'm down! I'm sorry!

326
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:56,571
Oh god, blood on my hands!

327
00:21:56,671 --> 00:21:59,771
You just had to stand there with IRyS.

328
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:07,771
Everyone safe? Everyone safe?

329
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,771
Nice, nice, nice!

330
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,771
Who do you think's gonna win?

331
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:13,871
I don't know.

332
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:14,871
I just want to survive.

333
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:15,971
True.

334
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:21,771
Left! Top! Right! Left! Top! Right!

335
00:22:22,071 --> 00:22:23,671
Oopsy! Oopsy!

336
00:22:26,371 --> 00:22:28,771
I'm dead. Pancake, pancake. I'm a pancake.

337
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:30,571
Want some maple syrup on you?

338
00:22:30,771 --> 00:22:32,071
I see you, Kronii.

339
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:33,471
I see you too.

340
00:22:33,871 --> 00:22:35,271
Wait, you're alive?

341
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:36,471
Wait, I'm alive?

342
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:37,671
I'm alive!

343
00:22:37,771 --> 00:22:38,671
You're alive!

344
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:39,871
Not anymore, I guess.

345
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:41,671
She's dead. She did, she did.

346
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:44,871
Oh my goodness. We've got two people left.

347
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:46,571
I'm ready! Let's go!

348
00:22:46,671 --> 00:22:47,671
Final! Probably final.

349
00:22:48,571 --> 00:22:51,771
Oh wait... oh! Oh! Easy!

350
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,271
Fauna hasn't moved!

351
00:22:55,671 --> 00:22:58,071
Fauna wins by doing absolutely nothing!

352
00:22:58,671 --> 00:23:00,071
We'll see about that!

353
00:23:01,371 --> 00:23:03,071
Competition's...

354
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:05,871
There's still enough space!

355
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:07,771
I'm gonna push! I'm gonna push!

356
00:23:08,071 --> 00:23:09,771
She made it! She made it!

357
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:10,771
I made it!

358
00:23:10,871 --> 00:23:11,971
Oh no! Oh no!

359
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:13,271
She didn't make it!

360
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:15,571
Wait, meteor was too fast!

361
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:16,771
I was pushed!

362
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:20,671
Looks like we have a winner!

363
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:23,071
Kronii! Kronii! Kronii!

364
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:25,771
I think we can do one more game.

365
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,771
One more game! Let's do that.

366
00:23:28,371 --> 00:23:29,771
I need my revenge.

367
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:32,771
Can we... are we revived? Can we come in?

368
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,471
Yeah! We're revived!

369
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:37,771
We live! We live! We live!

370
00:23:38,571 --> 00:23:41,671
Hey! Yay!

371
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:43,071
Wait, do we live?

372
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,271
I live!

373
00:23:44,371 --> 00:23:45,471
We live!

374
00:23:46,871 --> 00:23:48,571
Alright, one more game.

375
00:23:48,671 --> 00:23:52,771
If Kronii gets a point, she's on the board for Kronii.

376
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:58,271
I'm sorry! I'm so quick!

377
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,871
I wasn't expecting that!

378
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:03,071
I'm sorry! Sorry!

379
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:05,571
Everybody's survived!

380
00:24:05,671 --> 00:24:07,071
We shifted so fast!

381
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:14,571
Tried to push me! You tried to push me!

382
00:24:14,671 --> 00:24:16,771
You tried to push me! You tried to push me!

383
00:24:17,371 --> 00:24:21,771
No! No! No! Don't push me nature! Ha!

384
00:24:22,571 --> 00:24:24,771
Oh, at least I'm not the first one.

385
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:28,771
Here comes next. Nice.

386
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:33,071
Wait, did we make it?

387
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,471
I made it! Nice, nice!

388
00:24:34,571 --> 00:24:36,071
Oh nice, nice, nice.

389
00:24:37,571 --> 00:24:39,271
That was a nice break.

390
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:41,471
I feel like pushing again.

391
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:42,771
Let's not.

392
00:24:43,771 --> 00:24:45,471
Well, looks like someone's gonna get pushed!

393
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:46,571
Shove! Shove!

394
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:47,671
Wait, ah!

395
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:52,771
I'm out! I'm out!

396
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:55,871
I'm surprised I won that push.

397
00:24:56,071 --> 00:24:57,771
It's because I tripped.

398
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:02,884
Nice!

399
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:03,684
I'm ready.

400
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:05,817
Oh!

401
00:25:11,584 --> 00:25:12,717
Wait, is it done?

402
00:25:12,717 --> 00:25:14,017
It's done. Nice.

403
00:25:14,017 --> 00:25:15,884
I'm good, I'm good.

404
00:25:15,884 --> 00:25:17,150
Oh, this is why Mumei—

405
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,650
Target selection.

406
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,017
I made a grave mistake.

407
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,250
Oh, hello.

408
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,084
You should've gone for me.

409
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,050
It's IRyS versus Baelz.

410
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,084
Oh, this is easy.

411
00:25:27,084 --> 00:25:27,917
Bae is scary.

412
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,017
Bae is scary.

413
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:30,584
Oh, IRyS is super far.

414
00:25:30,817 --> 00:25:32,217
I'm so lost.

415
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,784
Okay, okay.

416
00:25:36,217 --> 00:25:38,917
Oh, easy. I don't have to move honestly.

417
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,717
Why did you move?

418
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,584
It's strategy. Strategy, strategy, strategy.

419
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,784
Oh!

420
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,884
Oh, okay. Okay, okay.

421
00:25:49,384 --> 00:25:51,650
We good? We good? We good?

422
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,150
Alright, what next?

423
00:25:54,884 --> 00:25:55,884
Oh!

424
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,584
Sabotage!

425
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:02,250
I'm ready. I'm ready for some sabotage.

426
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:04,784
Sabotage, I'm ready for some—

427
00:26:04,784 --> 00:26:06,117
I am not hearing you.

428
00:26:06,117 --> 00:26:07,350
I hear nothing.

429
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:14,717
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

430
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:20,650
Did she make it? Did she make it?

431
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,684
Not yet!

432
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,017
Bro...

433
00:26:31,017 --> 00:26:32,650
Kronii, you're strong.

434
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,984
Kronii, you're strong.

435
00:26:33,984 --> 00:26:36,917
Thank you, everyone, for pushing me from behind.

436
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:38,984
I'd like to let everyone come in again.

437
00:26:38,984 --> 00:26:41,050
Come here, come here.

438
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,350
My goodness.

439
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,384
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

440
00:26:46,884 --> 00:26:49,917
The voices, the voices were just so tempting.

441
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,917
This was a huge game for Kronii.

442
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:02,250
She's now in the lead with triple point!

443
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,684
Triple point!

444
00:27:03,684 --> 00:27:04,784
Oh, wow.

445
00:27:04,784 --> 00:27:07,384
Baelz is behind with one point.

446
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,884
And with that, I believe we're ready for our next game.

447
00:27:10,884 --> 00:27:13,017
Next game! Next game!

448
00:27:13,017 --> 00:27:14,750
Next game, let's go!

449
00:27:54,884 --> 00:27:59,250
Okay, so the next game is Avoid The Void Challenge!

450
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,150
Avoid the void! Avoid the void!

451
00:28:02,584 --> 00:28:05,017
Yeah, well, hopefully avoid the void.

452
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:09,150
I think you might already know if you take a look at the stage.

453
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:12,150
Oh!

454
00:28:12,584 --> 00:28:14,850
This looks... is this really okay?

455
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,684
It's fine, don't worry about it.

456
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:21,584
Nah, nah, nah, just your imagination.

457
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,350
So, for each step, you have to pick either

458
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,384
the left or the right asteroid.

459
00:28:27,384 --> 00:28:30,850
And if you pick the wrong one, you'll fall down—

460
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,817
Into the void.

461
00:28:32,817 --> 00:28:34,984
Yeah, it's gonna be pretty hard.

462
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:38,917
Into the goal without falling, so you can try again until you make it.

463
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,217
Wait, we don't die?

464
00:28:41,217 --> 00:28:42,750
Yeah, we don't die.

465
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,750
We don't die.

466
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,650
Darn it!

467
00:28:44,884 --> 00:28:45,784
Darn it?

468
00:28:45,784 --> 00:28:47,350
What do you mean, darn it?

469
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,584
Darn it! I wanted the risk, you know?

470
00:28:51,384 --> 00:28:54,050
It's fine, IRyS, next time.

471
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,884
But this is the promise theme, next game.

472
00:28:56,884 --> 00:29:00,917
Promise, we promise. Promise, promise.

473
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,117
So the person with most points goes first, which is me.

474
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,784
And the rest of you guys are gonna go after me.

475
00:29:09,784 --> 00:29:10,884
I go next?

476
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:12,350
Highest points to lowest.

477
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,750
I go third because I'm confident.

478
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,450
You go third because you lost rock-paper-scissors.

479
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,017
Rock-paper-scissors! I'm confident!

480
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,784
And then after that, me, me!

481
00:29:23,784 --> 00:29:25,150
I got second place!

482
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,817
And I won the rock-paper-scissors because I'm just lucky like that

483
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:30,050
and I go last, yeah.

484
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,984
Let's see how lucky you are when you fall.

485
00:29:31,984 --> 00:29:33,984
And you have the most advantage because of that.

486
00:29:33,984 --> 00:29:35,784
Luck's on me!

487
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,717
Well, I guess, I guess I gotta start.

488
00:29:40,717 --> 00:29:42,717
Yeah! You're starting! Let's go!

489
00:29:42,717 --> 00:29:44,650
Okay, let's jump right into it.

490
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,950
Okay! Jump right in! Later!

491
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,817
Jump, but think about it, think about it a little, you know?

492
00:29:50,817 --> 00:29:51,750
No, don't think about it.

493
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,150
Go through your instinct.

494
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,984
I feel very good. I think...

495
00:29:55,984 --> 00:29:57,984
I think it's the left one.

496
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,150
Yep!

497
00:30:01,897 --> 00:30:03,997
(Screaming)

498
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:05,363
Never mind.

499
00:30:04,397 --> 00:30:06,063
Never mind!

500
00:30:05,463 --> 00:30:07,030
Never mind.

501
00:30:07,063 --> 00:30:08,297
That was a shame.

502
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,030
That was a shame.

503
00:30:09,963 --> 00:30:11,063
Wait, does that mean... okay.

504
00:30:10,197 --> 00:30:11,497
It's your turn.

505
00:30:10,997 --> 00:30:12,030
Okay, my turn, my turn.

506
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,497
It's your turn.

507
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,730
Bae is up.

508
00:30:12,897 --> 00:30:14,197
Hey, you're back!

509
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:14,863
Hi!

510
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,830
Yeah, yeah, I...

511
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,663
Oh, why are you back?

512
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,530
Yeah, why...

513
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:17,563
What are you doing here?

514
00:30:17,197 --> 00:30:18,763
Is that how it is? You don't want me to be back?

515
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:19,330
No!

516
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:19,963
We like you!

517
00:30:19,763 --> 00:30:21,230
Of course we want you back!

518
00:30:21,263 --> 00:30:22,930
All right.

519
00:30:23,163 --> 00:30:24,897
All righty, ladies.

520
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,363
Okay.

521
00:30:27,763 --> 00:30:28,597
First...

522
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,063
Uh-huh.

523
00:30:29,597 --> 00:30:30,363
Uh-huh.

524
00:30:30,363 --> 00:30:31,297
Uh-huh.

525
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:32,230
Okay.

526
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,130
And this...

527
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:35,097
(Exhale)

528
00:30:36,097 --> 00:30:37,230
Oh, is she safe?

529
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,030
Am I safe?

530
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,463
Safe!

531
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:39,297
Oh, safe!

532
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,097
Safe!

533
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,597
Nice!

534
00:30:40,763 --> 00:30:41,830
Who's next after her?

535
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,730
She's doing pretty good, she's...

536
00:30:43,097 --> 00:30:44,430
Then you should probably start.

537
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,597
Should start already.

538
00:30:45,663 --> 00:30:46,663
All right, good.

539
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,263
Mind games, mind games.

540
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,230
They wouldn't do another diagonal...

541
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,930
Boom!

542
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:51,897
Mind games, mind games.

543
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,130
Mind games.

544
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,497
Mind games.

545
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,663
Safe!

546
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,197
Safe! Oh!

547
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,497
Okay, okay.

548
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,797
Wait, why are you following me?!

549
00:30:59,563 --> 00:31:00,197
Okay, okay.

550
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,063
How does this work?

551
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:01,797
Wait, how does this work?

552
00:31:02,497 --> 00:31:04,030
We don't go one at a time.

553
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,730
Boom!

554
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,097
Whoa!

555
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:07,430
Oh, wow!

556
00:31:07,297 --> 00:31:08,297
Oh, she's lucky!

557
00:31:08,097 --> 00:31:09,063
She's lucky!

558
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,963
So fast!

559
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,063
She's lucky!

560
00:31:10,997 --> 00:31:12,063
She's lucky!

561
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,063
I don't mind.

562
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,763
All right. Give us some of this luck.

563
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,263
Safe! Oh!

564
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,997
Next!

565
00:31:17,497 --> 00:31:18,730
Lead the way!

566
00:31:18,363 --> 00:31:18,963
Okay!

567
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,763
Lead the way, Rat!

568
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,863
That's a lot of pressure!

569
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,430
Okay.

570
00:31:20,863 --> 00:31:21,997
Guide us, guide us.

571
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,563
You're the leader.

572
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:23,697
Let's go.

573
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,663
You see the mathematical meme that's...

574
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,463
...going through my head right now?

575
00:31:26,297 --> 00:31:29,363
(Laughter)

576
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,063
Boom!

577
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,830
(Screaming)

578
00:31:32,963 --> 00:31:34,830
No...!

579
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,330
I know where to go.

580
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,930
I know what I must do.

581
00:31:42,197 --> 00:31:42,897
Okay.

582
00:31:42,597 --> 00:31:43,263
Okay.

583
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:43,830
Okay.

584
00:31:43,563 --> 00:31:44,430
Fauna.

585
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,263
Think about it.

586
00:31:44,963 --> 00:31:46,097
Think about it.

587
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,830
Think about it.

588
00:31:46,463 --> 00:31:47,230
Oh, boy.

589
00:31:46,963 --> 00:31:48,297
Sure, she...

590
00:31:48,397 --> 00:31:49,363
Okay.

591
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,930
I really have to think hard about this next one.

592
00:31:50,697 --> 00:31:51,863
Think harder.

593
00:31:51,697 --> 00:31:53,197
You don't need to think about it.

594
00:31:52,963 --> 00:31:54,463
You don't need to think about it, just jump in front!

595
00:31:54,463 --> 00:31:55,497
That's in front.

596
00:31:55,197 --> 00:31:56,197
Okay.

597
00:31:56,063 --> 00:31:57,263
So slip...

598
00:31:58,097 --> 00:31:58,997
Oh no, wait.

599
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,230
Now I know how it feels.

600
00:32:00,097 --> 00:32:00,930
Now you...

601
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,797
Now you think about it.

602
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,497
One of them!

603
00:32:02,197 --> 00:32:03,230
We're waiting!

604
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,397
Wait...

605
00:32:05,263 --> 00:32:07,330
(Screaming)

606
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,563
Oh no!

607
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:10,463
Oh no, no, no, no!

608
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:11,863
Oh, am I next?

609
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,130
Okay, I have to...

610
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:14,497
I have to think about it.

611
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,463
Think about it.

612
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,230
Think about it.

613
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,430
I have to think if I should jump or not.

614
00:32:17,197 --> 00:32:18,763
Got to think...

615
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:19,563
Before you jump.

616
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,297
No, just go!

617
00:32:19,997 --> 00:32:21,230
Just go!

618
00:32:20,763 --> 00:32:21,997
Think before you jump.

619
00:32:21,763 --> 00:32:22,930
I'm waiting.

620
00:32:22,697 --> 00:32:23,730
All right.

621
00:32:23,397 --> 00:32:24,363
I go.

622
00:32:24,263 --> 00:32:25,930
It-tse-tse-tse.

623
00:32:25,597 --> 00:32:26,663
Okay.

624
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,463
All right!

625
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,397
Looking good.

626
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,363
It's good.

627
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,830
It-tse-tse-tse. Okay.

628
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,063
That way?

629
00:32:31,597 --> 00:32:32,397
Oh.

630
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:33,297
Okay, what...

631
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,897
It-tse-tse-tse!

632
00:32:34,897 --> 00:32:36,297
I hate this. Okay.

633
00:32:36,297 --> 00:32:37,297
Okay, okay.

634
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,030
Me too.

635
00:32:37,763 --> 00:32:38,830
I'm gonna...

636
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,163
I don't mean to brag, but...

637
00:32:39,663 --> 00:32:42,063
I want to survive as long as possible until the last minute.

638
00:32:42,063 --> 00:32:43,097
I'm gonna...

639
00:32:42,897 --> 00:32:43,830
I'm gonna...

640
00:32:43,563 --> 00:32:45,263
It-tse-tse-tse-tse-tse!

641
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:46,597
Ah!

642
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,230
She safe?

643
00:32:46,963 --> 00:32:47,763
Huh?

644
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,763
Safe!

645
00:32:48,297 --> 00:32:49,230
Oh!

646
00:32:48,863 --> 00:32:49,963
Safe! Okay.

647
00:32:49,763 --> 00:32:50,930
Okay, I'm safe too.

648
00:32:50,897 --> 00:32:51,897
Nice!

649
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:52,463
Look, Mumei!

650
00:32:52,297 --> 00:32:53,563
I'm right behind you.

651
00:32:53,497 --> 00:32:54,597
Okay, now what could it be?

652
00:32:54,463 --> 00:32:55,897
Could it be...

653
00:32:55,497 --> 00:32:57,230
I would expect to go here.

654
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,430
Are you gonna jump there?

655
00:32:58,063 --> 00:32:59,997
But perhaps that's what they think I'm thinking.

656
00:32:59,797 --> 00:33:02,030
It might be a third time's a charm on this side.

657
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:02,963
It might be, it might be that.

658
00:33:02,797 --> 00:33:04,063
But are you...

659
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,063
You want me to fall!

660
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:06,030
No, no, no!

661
00:33:05,863 --> 00:33:07,330
I don't want you to fall until we get to the end.

662
00:33:07,063 --> 00:33:08,497
Make sure you get to the end.

663
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:10,097
Okay, so what do you want me to do, IRyS?

664
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,030
Okay.

665
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,963
I think...

666
00:33:11,863 --> 00:33:13,130
Third time's a charm.

667
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,230
Third time's a charm.

668
00:33:14,063 --> 00:33:15,063
Okay.

669
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:18,130
Safe!

670
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,697
Oh!

671
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:19,530
Yes!

672
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,163
I knew it!

673
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:20,897
I knew it!

674
00:33:20,763 --> 00:33:21,897
Nice, nice!

675
00:33:21,663 --> 00:33:22,563
I knew it too!

676
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,697
Okay.

677
00:33:23,463 --> 00:33:24,897
Now this work.

678
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,363
This is work.

679
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,230
It would be really interesting if it was the fourth one, right?

680
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,097
Right?

681
00:33:28,863 --> 00:33:29,497
Yeah.

682
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,363
Yeah.

683
00:33:30,063 --> 00:33:31,263
But would it be?

684
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,297
But would it be?

685
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,230
Let's test that theory.

686
00:33:34,297 --> 00:33:35,297
I don't know...

687
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,297
I don't know...

688
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:38,330
My Nephilim senses are tingling and saying it's...

689
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,297
I think I'd be...

690
00:33:39,063 --> 00:33:40,097
I think I'd be...

691
00:33:39,897 --> 00:33:41,063
I don't think it's jump across.

692
00:33:40,963 --> 00:33:42,297
I think I'd be...

693
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:43,330
I think I...

694
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,997
I just have to go here. Okay.

695
00:33:44,763 --> 00:33:45,663
I just...

696
00:33:46,097 --> 00:33:47,263
Oh!

697
00:33:46,863 --> 00:33:47,830
Safe!

698
00:33:47,663 --> 00:33:48,630
Okay!

699
00:33:49,763 --> 00:33:51,463
I'm not so sure about my chances anymore.

700
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,263
I'm like this close to falling in the back.

701
00:33:53,163 --> 00:33:54,830
If I make a mistake...

702
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:55,997
Okay, I think it's about time...

703
00:33:55,897 --> 00:33:57,130
...you start falling.

704
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,297
Oh!

705
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,997
Oh, my God!

706
00:33:58,763 --> 00:34:00,197
That's mean!

707
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,230
That's mean!

708
00:34:00,897 --> 00:34:02,197
I don't have a good feeling...

709
00:34:02,063 --> 00:34:03,430
...about this baby!

710
00:34:03,663 --> 00:34:04,630
Okay.

711
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,330
About time!

712
00:34:05,097 --> 00:34:06,197
Which is it gonna be?

713
00:34:05,997 --> 00:34:07,063
Which is it gonna be?

714
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,030
I don't know.

715
00:34:07,863 --> 00:34:09,363
Am I gonna regret this?

716
00:34:10,663 --> 00:34:11,497
Whoa!

717
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:12,830
Safe!

718
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,630
Okay!

719
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,763
All right.

720
00:34:16,997 --> 00:34:17,997
Let's see.

721
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:19,330
You got a 50/50 chance of being right.

722
00:34:19,197 --> 00:34:20,630
50/50 chance of being...

723
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,997
And if you fall, you fall.

724
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,063
I get an automatic win.

725
00:34:23,963 --> 00:34:24,797
Mumei.

726
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,297
Pick the right one.

727
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:26,997
No.

728
00:34:26,897 --> 00:34:27,563
No.

729
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,397
The right one.

730
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,030
No.

731
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,063
Don't pressure.

732
00:34:29,763 --> 00:34:30,830
Pressure!

733
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:31,563
Pressure!

734
00:34:31,397 --> 00:34:32,297
Pressure!

735
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:33,297
Pick the right one.

736
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,997
What, the right one?

737
00:34:34,897 --> 00:34:35,830
What, the right one?

738
00:34:35,663 --> 00:34:36,830
What, the right one?

739
00:34:36,663 --> 00:34:38,063
Go with your instinct.

740
00:34:37,897 --> 00:34:39,297
The right one or the wrong one?

741
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,097
I...

742
00:34:40,097 --> 00:34:41,030
I...

743
00:34:40,963 --> 00:34:41,897
I...

744
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:44,063
It-tse-tse-tse-tse-tse!

745
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:46,130
Whoa!

746
00:34:46,497 --> 00:34:47,263
Oh!

747
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:48,230
Oh, she made it!

748
00:34:47,997 --> 00:34:49,363
She made it!

749
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,097
All right.

750
00:34:51,097 --> 00:34:51,997
Okay, well we know the way.

751
00:34:51,897 --> 00:34:52,997
We know the way we're going.

752
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,030
Everyone get back!

753
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,963
Everybody!

754
00:34:55,563 --> 00:34:56,330
Tse!

755
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,630
Mumei, I love you!

756
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:00,430
I make good choices!

757
00:35:00,197 --> 00:35:01,230
Damn it!

758
00:35:04,511 --> 00:35:05,611
You are so good.

759
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:07,311
Thank you, thank you.

760
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:09,611
The Mumei instinct is real. It's the killer instinct.

761
00:35:09,611 --> 00:35:12,111
It's the killer instinct. It really is.

762
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,011
She got the sixth sense.

763
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,311
Seventh sense?

764
00:35:15,311 --> 00:35:18,611
You just have to have no fear whatsoever.
No fear at all.

765
00:35:18,611 --> 00:35:21,011
Wait, what? Wait, what?

766
00:35:21,011 --> 00:35:22,511
How many senses do you have?

767
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:25,911
Um, probably like 30.

768
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:28,011
Oh wow, 30 senses. Yeah, that's a lot.

769
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:32,211
That's good sense.

770
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:40,411
Okay, well, since Mumei is the winner for this game,
Mumei gets one point.

771
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:50,211
So right now, the points in total...
IRyS has no points.

772
00:35:50,211 --> 00:35:53,511
Ah! You didn't have to say that!
You didn't have to say that!

773
00:35:53,511 --> 00:35:58,811
I still have two points.
Mumei has one point. Bae has one point.

774
00:35:58,811 --> 00:36:00,911
Wait, am I really the only one
that doesn't have any points?

775
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:03,911
No, no. Fauna also...
Fauna doesn't have a point yet.

776
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:08,811
Wait, we're together.
Together in last place! It's okay.

777
00:36:08,811 --> 00:36:13,711
It's okay because there's still one more game.
So this could change everything.

778
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:18,311
It could change everything.
Game changer!

779
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:23,211
We don't know. We don't know really.
No idea.

780
00:36:24,711 --> 00:36:37,211
Well, yeah, well... onto the last game!
Are you guys ready?

781
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:16,711
All right everybody, it is time for our last game.

782
00:37:16,711 --> 00:37:21,611
Last game! Last game!

783
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:26,211
Oh, so much fun!
But I still have zero points.

784
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:32,211
Well this is your chance! This is your chance!
What chance? There's a chance?

785
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:36,211
Your chance is with...
Tug of War!

786
00:37:35,411 --> 00:37:39,511
Tug of War

787
00:37:37,211 --> 00:37:44,211
Oh no! Tug of War! Oh dear!
Shut up, shut up!

788
00:37:45,311 --> 00:37:48,011
I'm amazing at Tug of War.
You've never seen it before.

789
00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:50,611
Let me explain the rules here. Okay.

790
00:37:51,211 --> 00:37:56,711
When it's your turn, you have the chance
to challenge somebody. One member to play against.

791
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:56,211
When it's your turn, you have the right to challenge one member to play against.

792
00:37:57,411 --> 00:38:00,511
Whoever loses the tug of war will fall into space.

793
00:37:58,411 --> 00:38:09,711
Whoever loses the tug of war will fall into space. - If the person you challenge wins, they keep their points. - If you win, you get all the points from the person who loses.

794
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:05,211
Into the void. The void comes back.
The void makes its return.

795
00:38:05,211 --> 00:38:09,411
And whoever wins will get all of the points
from the person who lost again.

796
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:14,211
What? What? All of them?
All of the points?

797
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:17,211
Wait, hold on a second.
All of the points?

798
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:21,711
What was the point of all the other games then?
That's point-less!

799
00:38:21,711 --> 00:38:25,011
Aren't you glad?

800
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:32,211
Anyways, let's figure out who goes first.
How are we going to figure that out?

801
00:38:32,211 --> 00:38:34,711
Maybe we should do
the weakest person has to choose.

802
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:37,211
IRyS! IRyS!

803
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:42,511
Oi, oi! You said that way too fast!
IRyS! Well she's right next to you.

804
00:38:44,511 --> 00:38:46,411
She looks pretty weak.

805
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:48,711
Excuse me? I may stay at home...

806
00:38:48,711 --> 00:38:53,711
...but I actually have hidden muscles
all over my arm.

807
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:56,211
Really? Show us. Please show us.

808
00:38:56,211 --> 00:39:01,211
I'll show you guys. Okay, who's the winner
so far? Who's in the lead?

809
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:02,711
Kronii! Kronii!

810
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:09,211
Nah, nah. Come here. Come here.
Don't touch me! Come here! Let's go.

811
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:17,711
Hai! Hai! You stay there.

812
00:39:18,211 --> 00:39:21,211
Noodle-RyS will show you guys.

813
00:39:21,211 --> 00:39:23,211
You called yourself noodle?

814
00:39:23,211 --> 00:39:30,211
No, I'm Udon-RyS! Because Udon is much
stronger than regular noodle. Oh, I see.

815
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:42,511
If you make fun of me and you lose, you're going to
be so mad. Ooh! The battle's begun.

816
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:45,711
You guys ready? Ready! Yeah!

817
00:39:45,711 --> 00:39:48,011
Ready, set, go!

818
00:39:59,211 --> 00:40:01,711
This is what you get! The underdog!

819
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:03,925
So IRyS wins!

820
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:07,425
Yay!

821
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,925
I got that muscle right here.

822
00:40:11,025 --> 00:40:12,625
Okay, who wants to go next?

823
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:15,625
Who wants to challenge the winner?

824
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:18,025
I'm feeling pretty confident.

825
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:20,525
I think I can take you on, IRyS.

826
00:40:20,525 --> 00:40:23,525
You have the guts, I applaud you for that...

827
00:40:23,525 --> 00:40:29,725
But you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you!

828
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:33,325
You're like a lettuce!

829
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:36,525
You're like a salad!

830
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:39,525
You're like a piece of salad!

831
00:40:39,525 --> 00:40:42,925
Oh, them's fighting words.

832
00:40:42,925 --> 00:40:45,025
This is some trash talking.

833
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,725
Are you two ready?

834
00:40:46,725 --> 00:40:47,825
I'm ready.

835
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:48,925
Any final words?

836
00:40:48,925 --> 00:40:50,525
Prepare to die, IRyS.

837
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:56,525
Prepare for me to rip your salad out.

838
00:40:56,525 --> 00:40:59,525
Ready, ready, ready...

839
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:01,525
Ready, set...

840
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,125
Go!

841
00:41:16,825 --> 00:41:18,125
Bye, IRyS.

842
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:20,925
Well, nice.

843
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:23,825
So Fauna has put IRyS into her place
as the weakest.

844
00:41:26,425 --> 00:41:27,625
Shut up!

845
00:41:28,025 --> 00:41:29,725
One of the weakest, I guess.

846
00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:31,725
Alright, I think...

847
00:41:31,725 --> 00:41:33,525
I want to go up against Fauna.

848
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:34,925
You're going against Fauna?

849
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,925
Civilization versus Nature.

850
00:41:37,925 --> 00:41:39,525
Oh, that's good.

851
00:41:39,525 --> 00:41:40,725
Who will win?

852
00:41:40,725 --> 00:41:42,525
Okay, let's go.

853
00:41:42,525 --> 00:41:45,625
Battles of ready, time.

854
00:41:45,925 --> 00:41:46,725
Okay, let's go.

855
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:47,825
You can say it.

856
00:41:47,825 --> 00:41:49,325
All right.

857
00:41:49,325 --> 00:41:50,625
Are you ready?

858
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:51,725
My stance...

859
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:53,025
Battles stance.

860
00:41:53,025 --> 00:41:55,525
Do you have any trash talk—I mean,
pre-game talk?

861
00:41:55,525 --> 00:41:57,925
Fauna, your leaves look like they're wilting.

862
00:41:57,925 --> 00:41:59,325
Hey! Let's go!

863
00:41:59,325 --> 00:42:02,525
Why is everyone talking about my leaves today?

864
00:42:02,525 --> 00:42:04,025
I'm gonna develop a complex.

865
00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:05,325
Your face is nice.

866
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:07,425
Oh, your face is pretty nice, too.

867
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:09,325
Okay, that's getting too nice. All right, no.

868
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:10,725
Ready...

869
00:42:10,725 --> 00:42:11,625
Set...

870
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:12,525
Go!

871
00:42:19,325 --> 00:42:21,725
In the end, Nature prevails.

872
00:42:21,725 --> 00:42:24,525
Oh my goodness. I guess so.

873
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:26,425
It all comes back to Nature.

874
00:42:26,425 --> 00:42:28,325
All right. Anyone who hasn't gone?

875
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:30,625
Okay, I guess I will challenge...

876
00:42:31,525 --> 00:42:33,325
I'm here to defend my salad today.

877
00:42:33,325 --> 00:42:36,525
You got anything to say about your salad?

878
00:42:36,525 --> 00:42:39,425
Words about my salad too.

879
00:42:39,425 --> 00:42:41,625
Your salad's on the line.

880
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,125
Salad!

881
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:46,725
You're going down!

882
00:42:46,725 --> 00:42:48,825
Salads suck!

883
00:42:48,825 --> 00:42:49,925
Are you two ready?

884
00:42:49,925 --> 00:42:50,825
More like "sad-lad".

885
00:42:50,825 --> 00:42:51,725
All right.

886
00:42:51,725 --> 00:42:52,625
Ready...

887
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:53,625
Set...

888
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,025
Go!

889
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:03,125
Wow, some wilted salad right there.

890
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,925
Wilted salad.

891
00:43:04,925 --> 00:43:06,725
It was soggy. It went bad.

892
00:43:06,725 --> 00:43:08,525
It rotten.

893
00:43:08,525 --> 00:43:12,525
So, even though... has anyone been
keeping count of points?

894
00:43:12,525 --> 00:43:16,025
But whoever wins, you have the most points...
you have everybody's points now.

895
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:17,825
Yeah, I have all your souls.

896
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:20,925
All right, so Kronii didn't get to choose.

897
00:43:20,925 --> 00:43:23,025
IRyS chose her, but now it's Kronii's choice.

898
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:25,025
Your chance, who is it?

899
00:43:25,025 --> 00:43:28,025
Kronii, your only option... you have no choice.

900
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:30,725
Your only option is Bae, if you want to win.

901
00:43:30,725 --> 00:43:32,925
Unless you don't want to win, then you
can choose...

902
00:43:34,425 --> 00:43:34,925
Okay.

903
00:43:34,925 --> 00:43:37,025
Is this fair, though?

904
00:43:37,025 --> 00:43:39,025
Because she's like... I guess you're the
weakest now.

905
00:43:39,025 --> 00:43:41,625
I want to choose you! I want a rematch!

906
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:43,625
It makes no sense.

907
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:46,725
I want a rematch!

908
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:49,025
Bae's gonna win.

909
00:43:49,025 --> 00:43:51,725
You have to try to get your points.

910
00:43:51,725 --> 00:43:55,525
If you beat her, technically that means
I'm the strongest still.

911
00:43:59,825 --> 00:44:03,125
All right, Kronii, it's showtime.

912
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:06,625
Oh my god, are you okay?

913
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:11,025
Kronii, I always... I really liked you.

914
00:44:11,025 --> 00:44:15,325
I still really like you, and maybe you can...

915
00:44:15,325 --> 00:44:17,125
Does it make you weak at the knees?

916
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:19,825
Oh, looking at you, I'm like weak at the knees, Bae.

917
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:24,825
But the only person who can put me
at my knees is Kronii, not you. I'm sorry.

918
00:44:24,825 --> 00:44:28,625
God damn it, I tried.

919
00:44:30,025 --> 00:44:31,625
You guys ready?

920
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:32,925
All right, final...

921
00:44:32,925 --> 00:44:34,925
Ready, set...

922
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:36,325
Go!

923
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:04,139
Oh!

924
00:45:04,219 --> 00:45:05,659
Oh, where did that come from, Kronii?

925
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:07,339
Kronii!

926
00:45:07,339 --> 00:45:08,839
Wow!

927
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:11,359
Okay, maybe Kronii is not the weakest.

928
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,339
Maybe she is the strongest.

929
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:16,839
Okay, Kronii had something to prove, and she proved it.

930
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,339
Okay, okay, everybody calm down, calm down.

931
00:45:19,339 --> 00:45:20,839
Okay, okay, okay.

932
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:23,839
That concludes the game, it's time to go to the next stage.

933
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,339
Oh yeah, the next stage?

934
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:26,839
The final stage!

935
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:28,339
Oh, the final stage.

936
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:30,339
To find the results! Results!

937
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:31,839
Of who won every single game!

938
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,839
Yeah! Let's go! Yay!

939
00:45:37,839 --> 00:46:05,839
NowLoading..

940
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:13,339
And it is time to announce the final score!

941
00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:15,839
Yeah!

942
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,839
We have reached the end of the Promise games.

943
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:20,839
Already?

944
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:23,839
I know, it's such a shame. Aw man.

945
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:28,339
But to help announce the results, we're going to bring back A-chan!

946
00:46:28,339 --> 00:46:30,339
A-chan! Yay!

947
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:32,839
I'm here!

948
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:36,339
So cute! A-chan!

949
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:38,839
Feed me, feed me. Feed me, feed me, feed me.

950
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:42,339
Thank you. Thank you.

951
00:46:42,339 --> 00:46:45,839
Okay, the championship of the very first Promise games is...

952
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,339
Wait, can we have a drumroll?

953
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:54,839
[Drumroll] Okay...

954
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,839
Kronii! You are the winner!

955
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,839
Oh! Ouro Kronii!

956
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:02,839
I did not see that coming.

957
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:04,839
I did not see that coming either.

958
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:06,339
She is totally unexpected!

959
00:47:06,339 --> 00:47:08,339
Oh my goodness! This is a surprise.

960
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:10,839
Wait, it's a surprise? Okay, this is crazy.

961
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:15,339
Okay, as the championship, Kronii will be awarded a special trophy.

962
00:47:15,339 --> 00:47:16,839
A trophy?

963
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:19,339
Special trophy? Oh, I want a trophy.

964
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:22,339
Excuse me? I would've tried harder if I knew there was a trophy.

965
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,839
I thought the results were for laughs and fun.

966
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:26,839
I know.

967
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:29,339
Okay, here it is.

Where is it? I want one too.

972
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:43,339
Yes please, I'm waiting! Oh!

973
00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:46,839
No, no, no, only Kronii. Thank you, thank you, Kronii.

974
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:50,339
Wait, yeah, how does it look? What kind of trophy is it?

975
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:55,839
Kronii has won this special Yagoo trophy!

976
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,839
It's okay, you can keep it, fam. Whoa!

977
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,339
Wait, is he shirtless?

978
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:03,839
Shirtless? He is shirtless!

979
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,839

Yeah, he is built! He's a buff boy!

981
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:11,339
He looks good! Damn! Very nice!

983
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:18,839

01:00:07,984 --> 01:00:11,284

01:00:11,284 --> 01:00:15,284
an object which I personally have found very useful.

1140
01:00:15,284 --> 01:00:19,284
Stick it on the back of your phone, any phone,

1141
01:00:19,284 --> 01:00:21,784
and use it to stand up your phone, watch YouTube,

1142
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,284
watch Hololive wherever you are.

1143
01:00:24,284 --> 01:00:26,284
Wherever you go, you'll have a stand.

1144
01:00:26,284 --> 01:00:28,284
And it's in the cute shape of a sapling!

1145
01:00:28,284 --> 01:00:31,284
Yay! Nice! Perfect! Perfect!

1146
01:00:31,284 --> 01:00:33,284

Material: Polyester

1148
01:00:33,284 --> 01:00:36,284
so have you ever wanted me to hug you?

1149
01:00:36,284 --> 01:00:38,284
Well, I will never do that.

1150
01:00:38,284 --> 01:00:41,784
But, you can imagine yourself being hugged

1151
01:00:41,784 --> 01:00:45,284
by getting yourself Warden's Capely Embrace.

1152
01:00:45,284 --> 01:00:47,784
Look! Looks like my cape.

1153
01:00:47,784 --> 01:00:49,784
It's gonna be great.

1154
01:00:49,784 --> 01:00:52,284
Go get it. Get it! Yeah! Woo!

1155
01:00:52,284 --> 01:00:55,284
Who's next? Me! Me, me, me, me!

1156
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:56,784
Oh, hi!

1157
01:00:56,784 --> 01:00:58,784

Material: Lamp/ Silicone, Zinc Alloy LED Light/ ABS Resin

1159
01:00:58,784 --> 01:01:01,784
You can be matchy-matchy with me, we can be twinsies!

1160
01:01:01,784 --> 01:01:05,784
And it can light up the darkness in your life,

1161
01:01:05,784 --> 01:01:09,784
or it can light up whatever is lurking in the shadows. Yeah!

1162
01:01:09,784 --> 01:01:13,784
Woo! Get it! Get it! Beb-beb-beb-beb!

1163
01:01:13,784 --> 01:01:18,784
Gee, ever feel like you have nothing in your wardrobe

1164
01:01:18,784 --> 01:01:21,784

we can match! We can match!

1168
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:30,784
And it goes with the snapback and all your other merch,

1169
01:01:30,784 --> 01:01:34,784
like your bag and stuff. Ayy! Yeah! Get it!

1170
01:01:34,784 --> 01:01:39,784
Ayo! Yeah! Yeah! And that's not it!

1171

Because we have... the usual!

1172
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:47,784

As promised, the 3D poses!

1176
01:01:55,784 --> 01:01:58,784
They're much bigger than the usual acrylic stands,

1177
01:01:58,784 --> 01:02:01,784
and they look really nice together.

1178
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:05,784
So you better get the whole set. It's gonna look amazing. Yeah!

1179
01:02:05,784 --> 01:02:08,784
Speaking of HoloPromise... yeah!

1180

Did everyone enjoy Promise's first collab stream? Yeah!

1181
01:02:11,784 --> 01:02:14,784

01:02:31,784 --> 01:02:33,784
Nooo! Ohhh!

1188
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:36,784
Looks like we have to go, guys. Nooo!

1189
01:02:36,784 --> 01:02:40,784
If only we had just one more fun... well,

1190
01:02:40,784 --> 01:02:43,784
hold on. Are you asking what I think you're asking?

1191
01:02:43,784 --> 01:02:53,784
Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore!

1192
01:02:53,784 --> 01:02:57,784

極彩色のカラスがそれを奪い取って破り捨てた
A richly colored crow snatched it away and tore it up
