Don't you think we already hyped them up enough?

255
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:50,990
No! This is exciting! Gotta use our time! Gotta do the wave!

256
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:54,490
I don't know why I asked. Alright, fine, let's do it. Come here, come here.

01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:41,490
Everybody's real excited, yeah. Don't answer that...

273
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,490
...you don't need to scream anymore.

274
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:45,490
You don't, you don't. You're gonna lose your voices...

275
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:46,490
...by the end of the concert.

276
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,990
You're right. We should refrain from hyping them up anymore.

277
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:52,490
Well, yeah. So we're gonna kick off the solo songs actually from now on.

278
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:55,490
Gonna hear a lot of EN members' solos.

279

283
01:20:06,702 --> 01:20:09,702
...and I have confidence that you guys won't either.

284
01:20:09,702 --> 01:20:12,702
You guys will keep the energy going all the way to the end, okay?

285
01:20:12,702 --> 01:20:13,702

When we first met...

339
01:24:12,702 --> 01:24:15,702
...I wonder what you think of me.

352
01:24:48,702 --> 01:24:51,202

359
01:25:25,247 --> 01:25:28,147
Now you came along, it happens almost every time.

360
01:25:30,947 --> 01:25:32,647
And then I hear your voice,

361
01:25:32,647 --> 01:25:34,147
I'm left no choice,

362
01:25:34,147 --> 01:25:36,647
but to let you know what you mean to me.

363
01:25:36,947 --> 01:25:39,147
Finally, time to speak,

364
01:25:39,147 --> 01:25:41,447
through treasured memories.

365
01:25:41,647 --> 01:25:44,747
Now no matter where or when we're from,

366
01:25:44,747 --> 01:25:47,247
our friendship's elementary.

367
01:25:47,247 --> 01:25:48,747
Case closed,

368
01:25:48,747 --> 01:25:50,147
now you know,

369
01:25:50,147 --> 01:25:52,447
nothing can stop us now!

370
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:53,947
Let's go!

371
01:25:53,947 --> 01:25:56,147
Tick-tock, where does the time go?

372
01:25:56,147 --> 01:25:58,347
Wapu-wapu, how should I know?

373
01:25:58,347 --> 01:26:00,947
Why it seems when you're here with me,

374
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:03,247
the clock won't stop spinning...

375
01:26:03,247 --> 01:26:04,347

地球の歪み。
The distortion of the Earth.

381
01:26:15,947 --> 01:26:18,447
Though they say we're older,

382
01:26:18,647 --> 01:26:22,447
what the future holds is not, not, not for us to know yet.

383
01:26:22,747 --> 01:26:25,947
Gone, gone, gone before we know it,

384
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:28,947
so let's solve the question,

385
01:26:28,947 --> 01:26:31,747
we can make each second

386
01:26:31,747 --> 01:26:34,147
tick-tock, last forever,

387
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:36,747
wapu-wapu, now or never!

388
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:44,747
Tick-tock, where does the time go?

389
01:26:44,747 --> 01:26:47,247
Wapu-wapu, how should I know?

390
01:26:47,247 --> 01:26:50,247
Why it seems when you're here with me,

391
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:53,347
the clock won't stop spinning...

392
01:26:53,347 --> 01:26:54,247
Wapu-wapu-wapu-wapu!

393
01:26:54,247 --> 01:26:56,247
ドキドキ、heartbeat faster,
Doki-doki, heartbeat faster,

The solo parts have begun!

412
01:28:11,747 --> 01:28:14,247
Yeah, and Ina's dancing... it was so good.

413
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:16,447
Oh my goodness, she's always so good at dancing.

414
01:28:16,447 --> 01:28:19,147
She's such a good dancer! Ah!

I couldn't imagine it being like this, no.

429
01:28:56,147 --> 01:28:58,147
It's crazy! It's so cool!

430
01:28:58,147 --> 01:28:59,947
This place is huge!

Okay, there's one thing I really, really wanted to try.

433
01:29:03,747 --> 01:29:04,747
One thing?

434
01:29:05,147 --> 01:29:06,747
Are you guys ready?

435
01:29:07,447 --> 01:29:09,447
I say wah, you say wah!

It's like, I don't know, it's so unreal hearing you guys.

441
01:29:20,447 --> 01:29:23,447
I don't know, it kind of sounded like

442
01:29:23,447 --> 01:29:24,947
one side was louder than the other.

443
01:29:24,947 --> 01:29:25,947
Oh, you sure?

444
