Time to get this party started!

8
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,300
Fire, fire, light the fire
Brighter, higher, as you desire

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,800
Fire, fire, light the fire
Brighter, higher, as you desire

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,300
Chasing all that we aspire
Spreading out like wildfire

11
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,800
Spreading out like wildfire

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,300
Never ever have I ever
Been a sinner, been a dreamer

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,800
Take the chance and with my lighter

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,200
Spark the fire

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,100
Come burn me out

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,800
I'm not a sheep to count

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,400
This overkill and saddled stories
Wearing me down

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,500
Snap out of the system
Break out, give it everything

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,700
This is our time
Where yours to discover

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,700
Hello brand new world

21
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,500
Would you welcome the light

22
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,000
And free us from the night

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,500
Fire, fire, light the fire
Brighter, higher, as you desire

24
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,308

Chasing all that we aspire

30
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:19,408
Two steps to the left

31
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:20,908
Two steps to the right

32
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:23,008
Then back to where we started
And then over again

33
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,108
Step out of the circle

34
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:27,708
Break out, we've got everything

35
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:29,308

36
00:05:29,308 --> 00:05:31,008
Rejoice to discover

37
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:35,308
Blue sky, take us home

38
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:39,008
To where we belong

39
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:44,308
And free us from the night

40
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:46,508
Take us to paradise

41
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:48,308
Fire, fire, light the fire

42
00:05:48,308 --> 00:05:49,808
Brighter, higher, you desire

43
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,308
Ignite our beating hearts

44
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:54,608

To the other side of another dimension, I'll take you, Rebellion

48
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:24,308
I know that I can still be the future of this story

49
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:27,508
I know that I can be free, the one and the only

50
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:29,508
They tell me that I'm crazy

51
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:31,408
I'll never let them stop me

52
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,408
Within our afterglow

53
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:36,708
Time to get this party started

54
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,208
Ever, ever, have I ever

55
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,008
In a center, been a dreamer?

56
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:42,508
Fire, fire, light the fire

57
00:06:42,508 --> 00:06:44,008

00:07:45,308 --> 00:07:46,508
Hello, Advent!

00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:53,008
Whoo! Yeah!

76
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:56,208
Our debut song Rebellion in 3D!

77
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,508
How did you guys like it?

78
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:00,008
Are you guys hyped? Hype!

00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:02,008
Yeah!

80
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:06,008
Aw, you know we just really couldn't wait to show you
our first performance in 3D, could we?

81
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:08,508
Oh!

82
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:12,508
Oh, we're gonna do our best today! I'm so excited!

83
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:15,508
Yeah! Whoo!

84
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:20,008
Well, if we open that door, it should lead us to the
EN arena, right?

85
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:23,308
Yeah! Let's open it right now!

86
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:26,508
Yeah! Let's go! Let's go!

87
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,508
Wait, why isn't it opening?

88
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:31,508
Open up! Open up!

89
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:33,408
Hey, are you pushing hard enough?

90
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:34,308
Is there a key?

91
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:35,508
Are you touching the door?

92
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:37,508
Hee! Maybe back here...

93
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:41,008
Maybe we missed something?

94
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:42,508
Hmm...

95
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:46,308
Uh? Oh wait, guys, what the heck is that?

96
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:47,808
What? Whoa!

97
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:50,008
Muahahahahaha!
You've finally arrived, huh?

98
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:52,008
Ew, it's gross!

99
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:53,508
Who are you?

100
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:56,808
I am Pokey!
Have you not seen me on Advent's logo?!

101
00:08:57,008 --> 00:09:00,508
Oh yeah! I've seen you before! Hi Pokey!

102
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:05,008
Hi! Look at you! You're so cute! Aw!

103
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:06,508
BE SILENT!!!

104
00:09:06,508 --> 00:09:07,508
Sassy!

105
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:10,508
So you want to open that door and go stand on the
holoEN stage like real idols, right?

106
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,508
Yeah! Yes!

107
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:14,008
Well then, I'll open the door
after you complete three challenges!

108
00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:16,008
Three challenges? No!

109
00:09:16,008 --> 00:09:20,008
If you can prove that you're true idols and get
through all the challenges, the door will open!

110
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:22,508
I guess we have to do it then, huh?

111
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:24,508
We got it! Yeah!

112
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:30,008
Okay, so what are the challenges? Because I think we'll
be able to beat them really easily!

113
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:31,508
Yeah! That's right!

114
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:33,008
You seem to be pretty confident, huh?

115
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:35,008
Well then, time to get this party started!

116
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,508
Bring out the donuts!

117
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:39,008
Whoa! Donuts!

118
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,316
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

119
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:02,116
Right now? Okay.

00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,216
Ready? Everybody ready?

121
00:10:04,216 --> 00:10:05,416
Wait, so...

00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:09,116
Okay, here we go! Three, two, one!

123
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:12,316
Stick out your gyatt for the rizzler.

124
00:10:12,516 --> 00:10:14,616
You're so bau bau.

125
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:16,816
You're so Bibotax.

126
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,516
I just want to be your Shiori.

127
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:22,416
How was that?

128
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,416
You just got Bibotaxed in 3D!

129
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:26,516
3D! Yeah!

130
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:28,516
Let's go!

131
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:32,416
Enough! Enough! Enough!

132
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:35,416
This is a serious challenge! Stop that now!

133
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:37,816
Wait, Bibotax...

134
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,016
Fuwamoco can pass this easily.

135
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:42,516
Yahoo! We'll eat them all up!

136
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,516
Donut! Donut!

137
00:10:44,616 --> 00:10:49,016
Well then, if you love donuts so much... How about you get covered in them?!

138
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,516
1st Challenge: Donut Tower Challenge

139
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:54,016
Honestly, that's pretty... how was that?

140
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:55,416
What is that? Hey, yahoo!

141
00:10:55,516 --> 00:11:01,516
Alright, donut-lovers, FUWAMOCO, you step forward right now,

Down...

145
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:09,016
You guys are doggy in 3D! I know!

146
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:13,516
Good doggies, your first challenge has already started!

147
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:16,516
Stack all the donuts on top of FUWAMOCO!

148
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:21,516
You have 10 seconds to stack them, and keep them still for another 10 seconds!

149
00:11:21,816 --> 00:11:24,016
Easy! Ready? Go!

150
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:36,516

151
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:40,016
Okay now, keep it steady for the next 10 seconds!

152
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:51,516
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0!

153
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:57,016
Whoo! Oh, that was easy! Too easy!

154
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:03,016
Hardly a challenge! Yahoo!

155
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:10,016
You call this a challenge?

156
00:12:10,516 --> 00:12:14,516
Yeah, we were just sitting here. Yeah, it was...

157
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:18,016
Okay, you're done warming-up?

158
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:21,016
Now it's time for the real challenge!

159
00:12:19,016 --> 00:12:24,516
Eh? Yahoo? That was just a warm-up? That's not fair!

160
00:12:19,516 --> 00:12:20,516
FUWAMOCO, step forward!

161
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:26,516
Now sit!

162
00:12:26,516 --> 00:12:30,016
Whaiyo! Oh, they're doing it again. Oh no.

163
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,516
Down...

164
00:12:31,516 --> 00:12:34,516
Yeah, you like that, don't you? What is this?

165
00:12:35,016 --> 00:12:38,516
Aww, such good puppies!

166
00:12:38,616 --> 00:12:40,016
Yeah, you did good! Puppy time!

167
00:12:40,016 --> 00:12:43,516
Now show your tummies like good puppies!

168
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:50,016
Oh, so cute! Bau bau! Whaiyo! This is strange!

169
00:12:52,516 --> 00:12:57,016
This time, you have to count to five seconds after putting each donut on top of them.

170
00:12:56,516 --> 00:12:59,016
Ah? Why? Okay.

171
00:12:59,516 --> 00:13:03,516
Stay still. We got it, we got it. Stay steady.

172
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,016
FUWAMOCO, you need to count, okay?

173
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:06,516
Okay.

174
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:08,016
Ready...

175
00:13:08,216 --> 00:13:08,816
Go!

176
00:13:08,816 --> 00:13:17,016
Whai-yo, Two-bo-bo, Three-bo-bo, Fuwa-bo-bo, Five-bo-bo!

177
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:26,016
Whai-yo, Two-bo-bo, Three-bo-bo, Fuwa-bo-bo, Five-bo-bo!

178
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:30,516
Whai-yo, Two-bo-bo, Three-bo-bo, Fuwa-bo-bo, Five-bo-bo!

179
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:36,016
Whai-yo, Two-bo-bo, Three-bo-bo, Fuwa-bo-bo, Five-bo-bo!

180
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:41,516
Whai-yo, Two-bo-bo, Three-bo-bo, Fuwa-bo-bo, Five-bo-bo!

181
00:13:42,016 --> 00:13:51,016
Whai-yo, Two-bo-bo, Three-bo-bo, Fuwa-bo-bo, Five-bo-bo!

182
00:13:52,016 --> 00:14:10,016
Whaiyo! Whoo! Nice! Great job! We did it!

183
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,516
Wait, stand still for a moment.

184
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:20,016
I have something that, you know, after seeing you in that pose...

185
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:22,516
...I think I would like to use right now. What do you have?

186
00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:28,016
You remember? My birthday present! It's a piece of paper.

187
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:34,016
No! You forgot in... this been a year! It wasn't that kind of a birthday present!

188
00:14:34,516 --> 00:14:36,016
It was a really good birthday present. I want to redeem it.

189
00:14:36,516 --> 00:14:39,016
Oh right, now! Get ready!

190
00:14:40,016 --> 00:14:47,016
I got you! No! No!

191
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:51,016
Yeah, how about Fuwa-bau?

192
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:55,016
Nothing. But you know, now that I've got one touch, I don't think it was enough.

193
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:59,016
Can I have one more? No! Maybe for your birthday next year!

194
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,124
You did better than I expected.

195
00:15:02,124 --> 00:15:05,124
Well then, let's move on to the second challenge!

196
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:08,524
Okay, we're ready to beat the second challenge! Let's go!

197
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:10,524
Yeah!

198
00:16:10,524 --> 00:16:11,824
Yeah!

199
00:16:12,324 --> 00:16:13,524
Let's go!

200
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:14,324
What the beef is that?

201
00:16:13,924 --> 00:16:14,924
It's a box!

202
00:16:14,924 --> 00:16:15,524
Whoa!

203
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:18,524
I don't like boxes.

204
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:21,024
For the second challenge, I will test your courage!

205
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:25,524
I want each one of you to cover your eyes and put your hands inside the box.

206
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:30,024
Then you need to guess what's in the box, just by touching it!

207
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:34,524
2nd Challenge: What's in the Box Challenge

208
00:16:35,524 --> 00:16:37,824
Okay, how about you go first, Nerissa?

209
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:42,524
Ah, I mean, I guess, you know, even a child could probably play this game.

210
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:45,024
You'll be fine.

211
00:16:45,824 --> 00:16:47,524
Ready to try, Nerissa?

212
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:50,024
Alright, I'll take care of this.

213
00:16:50,124 --> 00:16:54,524
It might be too easy, so maybe I should put on a blindfold.

214
00:17:01,024 --> 00:17:02,524
Alright, I'm ready.

215
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,524
This is what's inside your box!

216
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:09,024
Kiara Plush Toy

217
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:09,524
Alright, come on, come on, my old lady.

218
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:51,024
What is it? What is it?

219
00:17:51,824 --> 00:17:53,024
You have to touch it!

220
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:55,524
You have to guess within time!

221
00:17:56,524 --> 00:17:58,524
Is it a puppy? I don't know.

222
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:04,024
Is it a mouse? Is it a kitten?

223
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:07,524
No! No! No! Meow meow!

224
00:18:08,524 --> 00:18:10,524
Is that your final answer?

225
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,024
You're kind of close.

226
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:17,524
Is it... is it Kiara?

227
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:22,524
I have no idea. I don't feel...

228
00:18:23,524 --> 00:18:25,524
You have to touch it once!

229
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:29,024
You can do it! Use both hands!

230
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:31,024
Is it Kiara?

231
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:40,024
Remove your blindfold.

232
00:18:42,024 --> 00:18:44,024
That was so stressful!

233
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:52,524
Kiara! It wasn't that bad.

234
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:08,824
I have this at home! I have this at home!

235
00:19:09,124 --> 00:19:11,824
It followed you all the way here!

236
00:19:12,124 --> 00:19:14,524
Every time I touched it, it felt like it was moving!

237
00:19:15,524 --> 00:19:18,024
That wasn't so hard, right?

238
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:22,524
YOU! THE LITTLE ONE! You go next!

239
00:19:22,824 --> 00:19:25,524
Hey! Who you calling little one, eh?

240
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:30,024
Don't underestimate the Gamer of Advent! Yeah!

241
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:38,524
Alright, so-called "Gamer of Advent," this time it's not something cute and fluffy like Nerissa's...

242
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:40,524
Oh, I'm ready.

243
00:19:40,824 --> 00:19:42,524
Come on, bring it!

244
00:19:42,824 --> 00:19:49,024
これは頭の中だけの話じゃない。Yeah!
This isn't just a story in my head! Yeah!

245
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:52,524
Wow, Japanese! Your Japanese is so good!

246
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:03,432
I am now one with darkness.

247
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:05,732
Let darkness guide you, my queen. Here you go.

248
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:09,932
Okay, what's in the box, Bijou?

249
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:11,432
Okay, I'm brave.

250
00:20:15,232 --> 00:20:18,432
Oh, what is this? What does it feel like? It feels hard.

251
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:20,932
Why were you so scared, Biboo? Huh?

252
00:20:23,232 --> 00:20:25,132
Wait, you... I'm brave.

253
00:20:25,132 --> 00:20:27,532
Okay, this is hard.

254
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:30,332
Okay, and it's cold.

255
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:32,432
Yes, I think I know what this is.

256
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,432
Biboo, feel it! Feel it really good!

257
00:20:35,432 --> 00:20:38,232
Okay, I'll feel... I'll feel it up real good.

258
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:41,532
Whoa... Whoa. Mmm, do you like this? I'll feel it up...

259
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,832
Whoa, Biboo, you're so gentle.

260
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:46,032
Oh, it feels so good, right?

261
00:20:46,032 --> 00:20:48,432
Oh, shut up, Biboo! Oh!

262
00:20:48,432 --> 00:20:50,032
Is it the pebble?

263
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:51,532
Is it the pebble?

264
00:20:51,532 --> 00:20:53,132
Is it the rock? Wait...

265
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:55,232
Whoa!

266
00:20:55,232 --> 00:20:58,232
I'm disappointed. Keep... keep touching more of it.

267
00:20:58,232 --> 00:21:00,032
It's not... it's not a rock?

268
00:21:00,032 --> 00:21:02,532
I said to feel it really good and you didn't. Yeah!

269
00:21:02,532 --> 00:21:04,232
Smack it around a little.

270
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:06,332
Go... go up, Biboo. Go up.

271
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,332
Come on, both hands. Both hands.

272
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:10,032
What's this?

273
00:21:10,032 --> 00:21:12,332
Whoa, it goes higher. Yeah!

274
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:14,232
It's a rock.

275
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,432
The rock. It's a rock, right?

276
00:21:19,432 --> 00:21:21,832
I mean, but you know...

277
00:21:21,832 --> 00:21:23,932
Yeah, you know.

278
00:21:26,732 --> 00:21:28,032
Is it... is it a geode?

279
00:21:28,032 --> 00:21:29,632
Is it a gem?

280
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:31,232
Geode?

281
00:21:31,232 --> 00:21:32,432
Mountain?

282
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:35,332
Why is it so tall?

283
00:21:35,332 --> 00:21:38,232
Any more answers? We got there, huh?

284
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:40,332
Wait, I thought this was going to be easy.

285
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,232
It's okay, it's okay.

286
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:46,032
I thought you were the best gamer, Biboo.

287
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:47,932
Yeah, but this is not a rock!

288
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,132
What is it?

289
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:51,632
Oh, is it a Moai?

290
00:21:51,632 --> 00:21:53,332
It's a Moai! It's a Moai, right?

291
00:21:57,932 --> 00:21:59,832
Yay!

292
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:02,132
All right, let's remove your blindfold. Come on.

293
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:05,132
Biboo wasn't feeling it well enough.

294
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:08,532
I know, it wasn't rock hard enough, huh? Shiori...

295
00:22:08,532 --> 00:22:11,032
I guess it was too easy for you, huh?

296
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:14,532
I did it! Yay!

297
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:18,532
Fuwawa, you're next! I'll need to give you a harder one...

298
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:20,032
Harder than this?

299
00:22:20,032 --> 00:22:22,532
I know your weakness, Fuwawa. Are you ready?

300
00:22:22,532 --> 00:22:24,432
My... my weakness?

301
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:27,732
Oh... that makes me feel scared, though.

302
00:22:27,732 --> 00:22:30,032
It'll be okay, Fuwawa.

303
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:33,232
Protect her smile! Yay!

304
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:37,332
Wait, the song demon guards us! You can do it! Yeah! Yeah!

305
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:39,632
Protect her smile! You can do it!

306
00:22:39,632 --> 00:22:41,532
I can do this! Let's go!

307
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:44,232
Let's go!

308
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:46,832
All right, let me remove your eyes.

309
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:50,032
No, both her little sisters are cheering her on.

310
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:52,332
What, both? Me and you?

311
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:54,032
No.

312
00:22:56,032 --> 00:22:59,232
Good luck, Fuwawa.

313
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:12,832
Wait, what is it? What does it feel like?

314
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:19,432
You can do it! You're so close!

315
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:22,432
You just have to touch it. Touch it!

316
00:23:22,432 --> 00:23:24,832
I want to be brave! I have to touch it!

317
00:23:24,832 --> 00:23:27,032
You can be brave, Fuwawa!

318
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:29,632
Be brave! Let's go! Fight it! Fight it!

319
00:23:29,632 --> 00:23:34,632
Come on, Fuwawa! You've got it!

320
00:23:34,632 --> 00:23:38,032
Wait, wait, wait! What... what is it?

321
00:23:38,032 --> 00:23:43,732
Wait, wait, wait! What... what does it feel like?

322
00:23:43,732 --> 00:23:46,232
What... what is this? What?

323
00:23:46,232 --> 00:23:49,632
It's... what is it? Is it... is it fizzy?

324
00:23:49,632 --> 00:23:51,832
Is it moving?

325
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:55,632
Ah, it's thick, kind of sticky!

326
00:23:55,632 --> 00:23:59,832
Ah, Nerissa! It's long! What is it? Move...

327
00:23:59,832 --> 00:24:02,832
Oh, yeah, use both hands. Yeah.

328
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:06,032
Both hands, both hands.

329
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:08,532
Hey, yeah, yeah! It goes boing-boing-boing!

330
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:10,532
Punch it, punch it!

331
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,632
Boing-boing-boing! Punch it, yeah!

332
00:24:12,632 --> 00:24:15,332
This is... Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!

333
00:24:15,332 --> 00:24:17,332
Yeah, show it who's boss! Yeah!

334
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,332
Pound it out! Yeah!

335
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,032
Now what is it?

336
00:24:21,032 --> 00:24:23,532
Do you think you can guess? Do you have a guess?

337
00:24:23,532 --> 00:24:27,432
I'm gonna pick it up, I'm gonna pick it up, I'm gonna show it whose boss! Yeah, yeah!

338
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,832
Is this... is this... a toy snake?

339
00:24:30,532 --> 00:24:36,532
Yay! Good job! Good job, Fuwawa!

340
00:24:36,532 --> 00:24:39,132
Ha! Good job! Pow!

341
00:24:39,132 --> 00:24:41,332
This demon dog's not scared!

342
00:24:41,332 --> 00:24:43,932
Yeah! Yeah! I'm so proud of you!

343
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:45,332
All right.

344
00:24:45,332 --> 00:24:48,832
You've conquered something especially scary. Well done, Fuwawa.

345
00:24:48,832 --> 00:24:50,132
Shiori, it's your turn!

346
00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:52,132
Oh, Shiori!

347
00:24:52,132 --> 00:24:54,632
All right, all right! You conquered it.

348
00:24:54,632 --> 00:24:58,332
I can do it, I can do it. Good job, good job. All right.

349
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:01,032
You're an archiver and a collector, yes?

350
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,440
You're an archiver and a collector, yes?

351
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,540
Yeah.

352
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,940
This creature may be in your collection.

353
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,140
But can you tell me what it is?

354
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,240
Oh! I've seen a lot of creatures.

355
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,540
All right, let me remove my eyes.

356
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,740
Give me your beautiful, beautiful eyes!

357
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,340
Say goodbye to your eyes!

358
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,440
Just for you, beautiful lash-light eyes.

359
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
I'm gonna take them.

360
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,040
All right.

361
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,540
Can I move?

362
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,040
Okay Shiori, what's in the box?!

363
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,540
スライム
Slime

364
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,740
Is it gonna bite? It's gonna bite Shiori!

365
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,540
I remember this thing!

366
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,040
Oh, wait, why is it wet?

367
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,540
Oh, what is it? It's slimy!

368
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Oh, sorry! Should I not do that? Sorry.

369
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,540
Did I hurt it?

370
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,540
Yeah, you did.

371
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,540
It's dead now.

372
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,040
Oh, be gentle! You've gotta be gentle.

373
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,540
Oh, gentle?

374
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,540
Oh man, I wanted to punch it.

375
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,540
Punch it! Punch it! Just do it!

376
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,540
All right, all right. It feels... it feels very moist.

377
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,840
It's very cold. It's kind of nice actually. I just want to hug it.

378
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,540
Do you want to rub your face in it?

379
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
No!

380
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
But I'll rub it against your face!

381
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,540
I think based on the slime you're feeling,

382
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,540
I assume it's Yoric.

383
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,040
Huh? Yoric?

384
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,540
Is it not my goop man? My little goop boy?

385
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,540
What?! How is it not my goop boy?

386
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,040
But it's all wet and gross. What else could it be?

387
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Something gross that's not Yoric? What?

388
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,540
Is it... is it my novel leeches perhaps?

389
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,840
Wait, you guys aren't gross,

390
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,540
so you're great actually.

391
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,540
Oh, what is it if it's not you guys?

392
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,040
Am I hurting it?

393
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,240
Yes!

394
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,540
It's dead now.

395
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,540
I think I killed it.

396
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,240
But so you're saying...

397
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,040
you're saying it's alive, right? Maybe?

398
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,540
No! Guess! What does it feel like?

399
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,540
It feels cold.

400
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,540
What does it feel like to you? Maybe like Mococo's tummy!

401
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,540
No! My tummy is warm!

402
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,540
Are you sure? No, it's cold.

403
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,540
I can't believe it's not Yoric.

404
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,540
Guess! What does it feel like?

405
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,540
Cold? Slimey?

406
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,540
Yes, slimey. And it's not ink?

407
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,540
So what's slimey?

408
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,540
Um, the cucumber in my fridge?

409
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,040
No, no, no! What's slimey? Think more simple.

410
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,540
Simple? I can't think at all right now, it's cold!

411
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,040
Slime? Is that slime?

412
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,540
I thought it was Yoric. That's ridiculous. I'm putting my eyes back.

413
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,040
Good job! Yay!

414
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:11,540
Wow... Let me check what this is.

415
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,540
It's not even Yoric. Pathetic.

416
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,540
Pathetic! I can't believe it's not butter.

417
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:25,040
Wow Shiori, you figured it out!

418
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,540
Oh yeah, after five tries, huh?

419
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:35,540
It's okay, you did it! Good job Shiori!

420
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,540
Okay, I have something extra special

421
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,540
for the last box.

422
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,840
Mococo, get over here!

423
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,540
Something special, like nice? Not like bad?

424
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,540
Of course special like nice.

425
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,840
You're such a special girl.

426
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,840
Okay, I don't like the dark but I'll do my best.

427
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,540
You got this Mococo! We believe in you!

428
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,540
Are you ready, Mococo? This one is really special!

429
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,540
I need a push.

430
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,540
Like a gentle push, but...

431
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,040
Stop, stop push!

432
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Guide me.

433
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,540
Okay, be really careful, okay?

434
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,840
And maybe go right to the front.

435
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,040
Go right to the front.

436
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
It's a little scary, so be careful.

437
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,540
フワワ
Fuwawa

438
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,540
It feels warm. What?

439
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,540
What was that?

440
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,540
Was that wet?

441
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,040
Mococo! Stop! Don't scream!

442
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,040
Wait, what?

443
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Don't scream!

444
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Wait, why is it moving? I feel dizzy!

445
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,540
I feel dizzy! Nerissa hold me!

446
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,540
I'm holding you.

447
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,040
I got you.

448
00:30:00,048 --> 00:35:00,048
What's in the Box Challenge

449
00:30:00,048 --> 00:35:00,048
箱の中身は一体なに！？
What is inside the box!?

450
00:30:01,248 --> 00:30:02,148
Oi, oi!

451
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:04,948
What was that? What was that?

452
00:30:05,248 --> 00:30:06,848
It's okay. It's okay.

453
00:30:07,148 --> 00:30:09,948
It feels like it's moving closer to my tummy area!

454
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:12,148
What's going on? What was that?

455
00:30:13,948 --> 00:30:16,248
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

456
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:17,448
You sure?

457
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:19,048
Yeah, I promise. I promise.

458
00:30:19,148 --> 00:30:23,248
Ah! It's touching me! It feels like it's moving closer to me!

459
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:29,848
What's going on? What was that?

460
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:32,448
It's okay. What was that?

461
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,848
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

462
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:37,448
What's going on?

463
00:30:37,548 --> 00:30:38,848
It's okay.

464
00:30:39,748 --> 00:30:43,148
Ah! What's going on? What is going on?

465
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:45,348
Don't swap it!

466
00:30:45,448 --> 00:30:48,548
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

467
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,048
Is it punching me? Wait!

468
00:30:54,448 --> 00:30:57,048
I wonder what... Do you have any guesses what could it be, Moco-chan?

469
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,548
Wait, is it... I don't know!

470
00:31:00,848 --> 00:31:02,048
Can I touch it?

471
00:31:02,098 --> 00:31:03,948
Yeah, it's okay. Yeah, it's okay.

472
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:05,548
Sticky!

473
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:13,248
Wait! What is going on? Ah! It's... it's just sticky! It bit my fingers!

474
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:15,548
It's okay. It's okay.

475
00:31:19,448 --> 00:31:21,548
Wait! Is this Mococo? Is this Mococo?

476
00:31:21,848 --> 00:31:28,048
Bau bau! Yeah! Mococo! Yeah!

477
00:31:34,948 --> 00:31:37,448
Why would I not? Mococo! Wait!

478
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:40,548
Mococo, you got there, huh?

479
00:31:42,548 --> 00:31:44,248
You look weird.

480
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:48,548
Actually, I licked you.

481
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,548
That's where you're gonna stay.

482
00:31:50,948 --> 00:31:52,348
She put in so much effort.

483
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:54,248
She tastes good.

484
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:57,948
Ah, Moco-chan, kind of tasted a bit sweaty today.

485
00:31:59,648 --> 00:32:02,848
So, on a scale of one to five, how would you rate the flavor?

486
00:32:02,948 --> 00:32:06,848
One to five? Like, a three? Sweaty and fuzzy.

487
00:32:07,448 --> 00:32:08,548
It's decent, I guess.

488
00:32:08,598 --> 00:32:09,548
Ten out of ten?

489
00:32:09,648 --> 00:32:12,548
Yeah, three out of ten. Three out of ten. Sticky!

490
00:32:13,048 --> 00:32:15,848
Alright, good job everyone!

491
00:32:16,048 --> 00:32:21,048
You guys did pretty good!

492
00:32:22,448 --> 00:32:24,848
Yay! Yay! Yay! Time for the second challenge, yay!

493
00:32:26,548 --> 00:32:28,848
Mococo-chan, you did a great job.

494
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:31,248
What a weird challenge.

495
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:33,248
I'll miss the slime.

496
00:32:35,348 --> 00:32:37,848
We didn't even make it Monopoly's!

497
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,448
That's still kind of mean, huh?

498
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:44,048
Hey, Monopoly's are great, but they're a little slimy. Bau bau!

499
00:32:44,848 --> 00:32:48,048
Don't get too comfortable. There's still one challenge left!

500
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:49,248
One more!

501
00:32:49,848 --> 00:32:51,548
Are you ready for the final challenge?

502
00:32:51,848 --> 00:32:54,848
Ah! Yeah! Let's try the last challenge. Are we ready, Advent?

503
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:59,048
Bau bau! Yeah! Let's go!

504
00:32:59,448 --> 00:33:04,548
Let me out of here! Why am I still in this box? No! This isn't where I should be!

505
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:06,548
It's your home! It's your home!

506
00:33:07,148 --> 00:33:08,848
It's your imagination, Fuwa-bau-Moco-bau!

507
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:13,048
Bye bye!

508
00:33:22,048 --> 00:33:24,048
One, two, three, let's go!

509
00:33:25,148 --> 00:33:28,448
Stickin' out your gyatt for the rizzler

510
00:33:28,448 --> 00:33:30,948
You're so Bau Bau

511
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:33,448
You're so biboo tax

512
00:33:33,448 --> 00:33:37,448
I just wanna be your Shiori

513
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:53,048
Bau, bau, bau, bau, bau, bau, bau, bau, bau, bau, bau, bau, bau, bau!

514
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,248
Okay, that was good.

515
00:34:02,848 --> 00:34:07,548
The final challenge is going to be an intense battle! Go ahead and take these special weapons!

516
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:13,848
Oh look, it's scissor time!

517
00:34:14,348 --> 00:34:19,048
I got my own gnome! He's fluffy too. Bau bau!

518
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:21,848
お前はもう死んでいる。
You are already dead.

519
00:34:22,548 --> 00:34:26,548
And I have my toe! Yeah, my toe! Ha!

520
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:31,048
Rock rock! Yeah!

521
00:34:31,248 --> 00:34:36,048
Yeah! I got the spoon!

522
00:34:37,448 --> 00:34:40,448
Let's see if you can beat this guy. Attack, my beautiful specimen!

523
00:34:41,048 --> 00:35:00,048
Zombie Challenge / ゾンビチャレンジ
Zombie Challenge

524
00:35:00,256 --> 00:35:01,056
Is it over?

525
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:01,456
Is it over?

526
00:35:01,556 --> 00:35:03,406
It's gotta be, right? Like there can't be anymore than that, right?

527
00:35:03,556 --> 00:35:05,556
No way is it over! Come forth, my minions!

528
00:35:05,656 --> 00:35:07,056
Wait, wait, wait!

529
00:35:07,156 --> 00:35:08,556
Oh no!

530
00:35:10,056 --> 00:35:11,556
Oh my god!

531
00:35:11,656 --> 00:35:13,056
Get behind me!

532
00:35:14,256 --> 00:35:15,556
Get them, girls!

533
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,056
No! Behind you!

534
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:19,056
Yeah! They're spawning!

535
00:35:19,156 --> 00:35:20,556
No! Stop that!

536
00:35:20,656 --> 00:35:21,556
Help!

537
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:23,556
Get them, girls!

538
00:35:23,656 --> 00:35:24,556
I got you!

539
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,556
No! Fuwawa, you can do it!

540
00:35:26,656 --> 00:35:28,056
No! You got this!

541
00:35:28,156 --> 00:35:29,556
Behind you!

542
00:35:29,656 --> 00:35:31,056
Help her!

543
00:35:31,156 --> 00:35:33,056
Fuwawa, no!

544
00:35:33,156 --> 00:35:34,556
Behind you!

545
00:35:34,656 --> 00:35:36,556
Yeah! Nice!

546
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:39,056
Nice! Oh my god!

547
00:35:39,156 --> 00:35:41,056
There's so many now!

548
00:35:41,156 --> 00:35:43,056
Get them!

549
00:35:49,056 --> 00:35:51,056
Oh, there's more!

550
00:35:52,056 --> 00:35:54,056
Wait, wait, wait!

551
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:55,556
It's my turn!

552
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:58,056
Take this, my gnome!

553
00:36:00,656 --> 00:36:03,056
There's more coming! Hit them!

554
00:36:03,156 --> 00:36:05,556
Get them, Mococo! Mococo, let's go!

555
00:36:05,656 --> 00:36:07,556
Hit them in their belly button!

556
00:36:08,656 --> 00:36:10,556
Step on them!

557
00:36:10,656 --> 00:36:12,056
No! Mococo, get you!

558
00:36:12,156 --> 00:36:14,056
Don't watch out!

559
00:36:14,156 --> 00:36:16,056
Watch out! Watch out!

560
00:36:16,156 --> 00:36:17,556
Behind you!

561
00:36:17,656 --> 00:36:19,556
You're doing the best!

562
00:36:19,656 --> 00:36:21,056
I know it!

563
00:36:21,156 --> 00:36:23,056
Behind her tummy!

564
00:36:24,656 --> 00:36:26,556
Oh, did Mococo die?

565
00:36:28,156 --> 00:36:30,556
Get them, Biboo! Go, get them!

566
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:33,056
Get them, let's go!

567
00:36:33,156 --> 00:36:35,056
Get them!

568
00:36:35,156 --> 00:36:37,556
Nice! Get them, Biboo!

569
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:39,556
That's it! Biboo!

570
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:42,056
Whoa! That's my queen!

571
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:44,056
I can see you! I can see you!

572
00:36:46,156 --> 00:36:48,056
Rock, paper, scissors!

573
00:36:50,056 --> 00:36:52,056
You're so good! You're so brave!

574
00:36:53,056 --> 00:36:55,056
You're right there!

575
00:37:01,156 --> 00:37:02,556
You did it!

576
00:37:02,656 --> 00:37:04,556
Get them, Nerissa!

577
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,556
Go, go! I got you!

578
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:08,556
Get them!

579
00:37:08,656 --> 00:37:11,056
Get them! Eat your cookie!

580
00:37:12,056 --> 00:37:14,056
Behind you!

581
00:37:14,156 --> 00:37:16,556
Nerissa, look out!

582
00:37:16,656 --> 00:37:18,556
Would be dead right now!

583
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:21,056
Whoa! Put them down!

584
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,056
I did it!

585
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:27,556
I'm trying my best!

586
00:37:27,656 --> 00:37:30,056
Nice!

587
00:37:32,056 --> 00:37:34,556
There's so many!

588
00:37:34,656 --> 00:37:36,056
My spoon!

589
00:37:36,156 --> 00:37:38,056
Get them! Come on!

590
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,056
Over there!

591
00:37:45,156 --> 00:37:47,056
Shiori!

592
00:37:47,156 --> 00:37:49,056
It's Shiori's turn!

593
00:37:49,156 --> 00:37:51,056
I'm tired.

594
00:37:51,156 --> 00:37:53,056
Oh my god! Get them!

595
00:37:53,156 --> 00:37:55,556
Use the rocks!

596
00:37:55,656 --> 00:37:57,556
No! Use the bread!

597
00:37:57,656 --> 00:37:59,556
Yeah! Go!

598
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:03,056
Oh, Shiori!

599
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,556
Go! Shiori!

600
00:38:10,156 --> 00:38:12,056
Shiori, watch out!

601
00:38:13,156 --> 00:38:15,556
Shiori is coming!

602
00:38:20,156 --> 00:38:22,056
Is it over?

603
00:38:23,656 --> 00:38:25,556
I think we've gotta be good, right?

604
00:38:25,656 --> 00:38:28,056
There's no way there's anymore after all that.

605
00:38:28,156 --> 00:38:30,056
I'm too old for this.

606
00:38:33,156 --> 00:38:34,556
Wait!

607
00:38:34,656 --> 00:38:36,556
Stop!

608
00:38:38,656 --> 00:38:40,556
Where are they?

609
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:43,056
They're behind us!

610
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:45,056
Mococo, watch out!

611
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,556
Watch out! Help me!

612
00:38:52,656 --> 00:38:53,556
Use the power of music!!!

613
00:38:54,156 --> 00:38:56,556
Alright, Advent, I think we've got no choice!

614
00:38:57,156 --> 00:38:59,556
Let's do this, Advent!

615

616
00:39:19,506 --> 00:39:22,086
薔薇の蕾を繋げて
Connecting rosebuds together

617
00:39:22,086 --> 00:39:24,516
銀の鎖越えて
Beyond the silver chains

618
00:39:24,516 --> 00:39:27,176
今宵も独り果てる
Tonight again I perish alone

619
00:39:27,176 --> 00:39:29,676
あなたが憎らしい
I find you detestable

620
00:39:29,676 --> 00:39:32,176
膝を突いてお嘗めよ
Get on your knees and lick

621
00:39:32,176 --> 00:39:34,676
苦い愛の雫を
The bitter droplets of love

622
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:37,056
天使に施す
Bestowing upon angels

623
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:39,556
彩の挿絵
A colorful illustration

624
00:39:43,356 --> 00:39:45,656
慈愛と優越感の中
Amidst affection and superiority

625
00:39:45,656 --> 00:39:48,056
心はまた肥えて
My heart swells again

626
00:39:48,056 --> 00:39:51,056
捥ぎれた羽は月光に
Plucked wings in the moonlight

627
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:54,056
生き返り蠢く
Come back to life and squirm

628
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:02,664
ああ　闇夜よりも
Ah, even more than the dark night

629
00:40:02,664 --> 00:40:05,864
かぐわしき黒
A fragrant blackness

630
00:40:05,864 --> 00:40:11,264
二人の墓標　十字架の下で
Under the cross of our two gravestones

631
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:17,364
結びましょう
Let us unite

632
00:40:17,364 --> 00:40:19,864
薔薇の鎖を外して
Removing the chain of roses

633
00:40:19,864 --> 00:40:22,364
白い手首を重ねて
Overlapping our white wrists

634
00:40:22,364 --> 00:40:25,564
触れ合うことの奇跡　あなたが愛おしい
The miracle of touching each other; you are dear to me

635
00:40:25,564 --> 00:40:27,764
瞳を閉じて捧げよう
I'll close my eyes and offer up...

636
00:40:27,764 --> 00:40:30,164
痛い愛の言葉を
...painful words of love

637
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:33,764
ガラスに滲んだ　赤いアネモネ
Red anemones blurred on the glass

638
00:40:37,364 --> 00:40:41,264
さあ、今、好きと言って
Now, say you love me

00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:45,364

With your scarlet lips

640
00:40:57,364 --> 00:41:00,664
背徳は　そびえ立つ城壁
Immorality is a towering castle wall

641
00:41:00,664 --> 00:41:03,964
阿るのは神
The one who cajoles is God

642
00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:08,564
そうなふうに　導き続けて
Continue to lead me that way

643
00:41:08,564 --> 00:41:13,964
そして　私の目を
And then, my eyes...

644
00:41:13,964 --> 00:41:20,564
塞いだら　誰より優しく
If you cover them, more gently than anyone else...

645
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:24,364
名前を呼んで
Call out my name

646
00:41:24,364 --> 00:41:27,864
その時　知るでしょう
At that time, you will know...

647
00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:31,064
永遠の意味を
The meaning of eternity

648
00:41:31,064 --> 00:41:33,464

On the other side of the mirror

651
00:41:38,264 --> 00:41:40,464
全てが狂おしい
Everything is maddening

652
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,564
迷い込んで悟りましょう
Let's wander in and realize...

653
00:41:42,564 --> 00:41:45,064

さあ、今、好きと言って
Now, say you love me

純潔の唇で
With your pure lips

658
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:24,464

00:42:24,464 --> 00:42:26,764
銀の鎖を咥えて
Taking the silver chain in my mouth

660
00:42:26,764 --> 00:42:29,264
今宵も一人果てる
Tonight too, I perish alone

661
00:42:29,264 --> 00:42:31,264
あなたが憎らしい
I detest you

662
00:42:31,264 --> 00:42:33,664
跪いてなめましょう
Let's kneel and lick...

663
00:42:33,664 --> 00:42:35,864
苦い愛の雫を
...bitter drops of love

664
00:42:35,864 --> 00:42:38,864
天使に施す
Bestowing upon angels...

665

触れ合うことの奇跡　あなたが愛おしい
The miracle of touching each other; you are dear to me

669
00:42:48,564 --> 00:42:51,064
瞳を閉じて捧げよう
I'll close my eyes and offer up...

670
00:42:51,064 --> 00:42:53,364
痛い愛の言葉を
...painful words of love

671
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:57,864
ガラスに滲んだ　赤いアネモネ
Red anemones blurred on the glass

672
00:42:57,864 --> 00:43:01,864
心から　好きという
To say I love you from my heart

673
00:43:01,864 --> 00:43:06,064
汚れなき口づけを
With a stainless kiss

674
00:43:39,364 --> 00:43:42,564
Yeah! We did it! We beat all those zombies!

675
00:43:42,564 --> 00:43:45,564
Yay!

676
00:43:48,364 --> 00:43:50,364
Looks like you guys are true idols, huh?

677
00:43:50,364 --> 00:43:52,364
I'm gonna need to hear you sing some more, though!

678
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:54,864
What? You said that the door would open

679
00:43:54,864 --> 00:43:56,864
if we go through three challenges!

680
00:43:57,064 --> 00:44:00,064
You're totally hooked on us, aren't you?

681
00:44:00,064 --> 00:44:02,064
Well then, let's perform our second original song

682
00:44:02,064 --> 00:44:03,964
and open the door!

683
00:44:03,964 --> 00:44:05,364
Hoi!

684
00:44:05,564 --> 00:44:10,564
Please listen to our new original song...

685
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,764
...Sirens!

686
00:44:30,364 --> 00:44:32,864
Let's play, thought that you liked my wild side

687
00:44:32,864 --> 00:44:34,464
Come gimme, gimme a bite

688
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:36,864
Bite, why you don't got no white?

689
00:44:36,864 --> 00:44:38,864
Good things come in twos,

690
00:44:38,864 --> 00:44:40,864
I don't think you got a clue

691
00:44:40,864 --> 00:44:43,964
Can't take a hint? Come on, roll the dice

692
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:45,964
If you want it, then you gotta gotta catch 'em

693
00:44:45,964 --> 00:44:47,464
My boy's games I can't forget,

694
00:44:47,464 --> 00:44:48,864
haven't you noticed?

695
00:44:48,864 --> 00:44:52,864
What you keep down comes back around, our little secret

696
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:56,564
Open the cage and fly away, my new horizon

697
00:44:56,564 --> 00:44:58,564
Only need one chance

698
00:45:00,485 --> 00:45:01,961
I've been running so long

699
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:04,217
Don't rush it, chase me until

700
00:45:04,217 --> 00:45:07,109
You can't breathe no when

701
00:45:07,322 --> 00:45:10,591
Living on the edge of a phantom where you drew the line

702
00:45:10,813 --> 00:45:14,147
I love it, the sound of ecstasy

703
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,888
Just sirens, sirens, sirens

704
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:20,665
You know how I like it, like it

705
00:45:20,961 --> 00:45:24,295
I'm quicker than lightning, sirens

706
00:45:25,147 --> 00:45:28,739
Oh yeah, running don't need a rewind don't care what's wrong

707
00:45:29,147 --> 00:45:31,591
I hear the sirens, sirens, sirens loud

708
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:34,295
Chasing spin me round and round

709
00:45:34,295 --> 00:45:36,591
Play all night I love the sound

710
00:45:36,591 --> 00:45:39,091
Let me hear the sirens

711
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:41,091
Up and down and underground

712
00:45:41,091 --> 00:45:43,739
Sirens blasting all around

713
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:47,091
Oh baby it makes me feel so...

714
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:50,999
Hit me, I'll hit back, a stronger maniac

715
00:45:51,202 --> 00:45:54,332
Come break me, but careful, don't touch, look up

716
00:45:54,536 --> 00:45:57,499
I got a long list, no just about you

717
00:45:57,499 --> 00:46:00,055
You try to make a move, big thank you

718
00:46:00,202 --> 00:46:02,832
Go look around for help, it's no use

719
00:46:02,832 --> 00:46:03,295
I, I, it's no use

720
00:46:03,295 --> 00:46:06,480
My foolish games, I can't be hidden, haven't you noticed?

721
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:10,055
What you keep down comes back around and you're gonna like it

722
00:46:10,629 --> 00:46:13,517
Opening the cage I'll fly away, my new horizon

723
00:46:13,795 --> 00:46:17,406
Only need one chance, wanna hear sirens

724
00:46:17,832 --> 00:46:20,221
Just sirens, sirens, sirens

725
00:46:20,425 --> 00:46:24,017
You know how I like it, like it

726
00:46:24,332 --> 00:46:27,629
I'm quicker than lightning, sirens

727
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,888
Oh yeah, running don't need a rewind don't care what's wrong or what's right

728
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,406
Turn it up a notch, make it dangerous

729
00:46:35,888 --> 00:46:39,110
Kicking through the night, we're outrageous

730
00:46:39,406 --> 00:46:42,629
Who said you were big? You can't tame us

731
00:46:42,888 --> 00:46:46,591
Turn it up a notch, make it danger...

732
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:47,239
Hey!

733
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:52,091
Sirens, give me adrenaline

734
00:46:53,202 --> 00:46:57,517
My perfect chase, heart race, let's stay this way

735
00:46:58,184 --> 00:47:00,147
Ah hear your call

736
00:47:00,147 --> 00:47:02,091
Come on give me a sign

737
00:47:02,388 --> 00:47:04,795
Sirens, sirens, sirens

738
00:47:04,999 --> 00:47:08,536
You know how I like it, like it

739
00:47:08,832 --> 00:47:12,184
I'm quicker than lightning, sirens

740
00:47:12,943 --> 00:47:16,184
Oh yeah, running don't need a rewind don't care what's wrong

741
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:18,961
I hear the sirens, sirens, sirens loud

742
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,647
Chasing spin me round and round

743
00:47:21,647 --> 00:47:24,091
Play all night I love the sound

744
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,499
Let me hear the sirens

745
00:47:26,499 --> 00:47:28,591
Up and down and underground

746
00:47:28,591 --> 00:47:31,091
Sirens blasting all around

747
00:47:31,091 --> 00:47:34,406
Oh baby it makes me feel so...

748
00:47:42,572 --> 00:47:45,406
ADVENT-S! How was that performance?

749
00:47:45,406 --> 00:47:47,461
Did you like it?

750
00:47:47,461 --> 00:47:51,202
We're not criminals, we're idols, right?

751
00:47:53,461 --> 00:47:56,221
That was FANTASTIC!!

752
00:47:56,221 --> 00:47:58,813
We need to show the world how amazing Advent is.

753
00:47:58,813 --> 00:48:00,461
You can open the door now,

754
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:01,425
go, go!

755
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,591
Are we ready, Advent?

756
00:48:09,591 --> 00:48:11,406
We're ready, Advent!

757
00:48:11,517 --> 00:48:13,332
Okay, let's go!

758
00:48:13,332 --> 00:48:15,091
Let's go! Bau Bau!

759
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:25,480
Alright, everyone's waiting for us, so let's go!

760
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,572
Yeah! Let's go!

761
00:48:45,499 --> 00:48:48,888
Parade, parade, parade, it's time to take the stage

762
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:52,629
I hear the voices calling out our name

763
00:49:00,184 --> 00:49:03,610
Parade, parade, parade, a new journey awaits

764
00:49:03,813 --> 00:49:07,536
Just hear the sound and we can start again

765
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,147
Leaving only weightless echoes

766
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,572
I run because I heard a voice say go

767
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:47,406
Far away, let in all the darkness

768
00:49:47,813 --> 00:49:52,332
It's a name shining for us to notice

769
00:49:52,832 --> 00:49:57,480
Memories that fill us up with kindness and love

770
00:49:57,758 --> 00:49:59,961
You reach out and tell me...

771
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,280
Please come close

772
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,980
Let's surprise people who don't know

773
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,480
How rare what they call symbols

774
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,580
Here we are as one

775
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,180
Parade, parade, parade

776
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,580
It's time to take the stage

777
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,080
When disappointment gets in your way

778
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,880
Love will shine and keep you safe

779
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,980
Fill a realm with wishes

780
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,580
Your wings will take you high

781
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,480
These silent prayers will become our light

782
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,580
Guiding us on an endless flight

783
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,380
Finally we found each other

784
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,480
I can stand tall and say

785
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,980
Starting from here, starting right now

786
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,580
Our bright parade, parade

787
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,280
Listen

788
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,380
Full of amazing feelings

789
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,880
We sing

790
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,580
And we're not afraid of what they think

791
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,380
No one can

792
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,080
Take hold what we're imagining

793
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,980
They don't know

794
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,380
Of magic and our destiny

795
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,980
We met

796
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,480
This was an empty story

797
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,880
But now

798
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,380
Too many words to count them all out

799
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,180
Feelings that leave no room for doubt

800
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,480
Take a look at where we are now

801
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,080
All together as one

802
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,480
Parade, parade, parade

803
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,880
It's all so beautiful

804
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,880
The moments of our brightness shining

805
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,580
Lighting up the darkest night

806
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,980
Rain and shine and treasure

807
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,480
A kaleidoscope sky

808
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:43,380
A journey that is meant just for us

809
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,580
And here I am right by your side

810
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:51,580
Cause here I am standing by your side

811
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:56,580
When you look back and up the next time

812
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,080
You'll hear us saying welcome home

813
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:06,580
Forever we'll be waiting

814
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,480
Parade, parade, parade

815
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,880
It's time to take the stage

816
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,880
We're gonna shine right through the darkness

817
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:18,080
Open up share your light

818
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:21,080
Parade, parade, parade

819
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,480
It's time to take the stage

820
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,180
When disappointment gets in your way

821
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,880
Love will shine and keep you safe

822
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,380
Fill a realm with wishes

823
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,880
Your wings will take you high

824
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,880
These silent prayers will become our light

825
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,580
Guiding us on an endless flight

826
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,280
Yeah, yeah

827
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,880
Ready to dive into

828
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,380
A beautiful star that's new

829
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,480
Starting from here, starting right now

830
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,080
Our bright parade, parade

831
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:54,880
Our bright parade, parade

832
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,080
Whoo!

833
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,280
We're finally here! We're on the stage!

834
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:16,580
Yay! Whoo!

835
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,580
Oh, I've dreamed about this stage for so long!

836
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,580
Yes! So many stars and people here!

837
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,580
Wait, did you realize?

838
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,080
Our senpai were standing right there!

839
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,580
We're finally there!

840
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,580
They stood here! And now we are!

841
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,580
And now we're also senpai together!

842
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,280
Wow!

843
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,480
Well, we have one more song for you guys!

844
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,880
Everybody ready?

845
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:51,580
Yeah! Ready! Let's go! Whoo!

846
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,180
We're ready to greet the world

847
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,380
We're voyaging forward

848
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,580
With courage run toward a brand new start

849
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,580
Let's go live

850
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,380
Bridging the distance across the sea

851
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,380
Endless breeze

852
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,080
Meeting heart to heart

853
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,880
Waking from a dream

854
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,680
Run up into a stream

855
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,080
I make a wish and wait for my cue

856
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,880
How will we connect

857
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,280
In this new frontier we're journeying through

858
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,280
Starting in a scene where no one's ever been

859
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,080
With vibrant colors bursting like stars

860
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,880
Radiant and warm

861
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:50,080
Charged with energy that's carried us this far

862
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,280
Each new debut brings a miracle to life

863
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,080
Sure we thought it'd take...

864
00:55:00,654 --> 00:55:04,354
Just when we're running out of stop, straight to the top, that's right!

865
00:55:06,754 --> 00:55:08,488
We're ready to seize the game,

866
00:55:08,488 --> 00:55:10,588
a shimmering showcase,

867
00:55:10,588 --> 00:55:13,254
creating a new phrase where we can shine.

868
00:55:13,821 --> 00:55:15,488
Day by day,

869
00:55:15,488 --> 00:55:17,854
our colorful stories will intertwine.

870
00:55:18,521 --> 00:55:20,754
Get ready to cross the ways,

871
00:55:20,754 --> 00:55:22,654
we're voyaging forward,

872
00:55:22,654 --> 00:55:25,588
with courage to run toward the brand new stage.

873
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:27,588
Let's go live,

874
00:55:27,588 --> 00:55:30,521
bridging the distance across the sea,

875
00:55:30,521 --> 00:55:32,421
endlessly, follow me,

876
00:55:32,421 --> 00:55:35,421
and we'll turn the page.

877
00:55:39,654 --> 00:55:41,521
Breaking through the doubt,

878
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:43,688
we know we'll figure out

879
00:55:43,688 --> 00:55:45,588
a way to clear each towering trial.

880
00:55:45,588 --> 00:55:48,254
Sharing all our hope,

881
00:55:48,254 --> 00:55:51,454
we can conquer any challenge with a smile.

882
00:55:54,388 --> 00:55:56,488
We'll link our hearts

883
00:55:56,488 --> 00:55:59,454
as we start to cross the globe.

884
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:01,554
Knowing

885
00:56:01,554 --> 00:56:02,921
no matter where we are,

886
00:56:02,921 --> 00:56:04,254
no matter how far,

887
00:56:04,254 --> 00:56:05,788
we can be stars, let's go!

888
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:21,554
I want to chase the wish unwaveringly,

889
00:56:21,554 --> 00:56:25,654
writing out a brand new story.

890
00:56:25,954 --> 00:56:27,954
Share the future that we can see,

891
00:56:27,954 --> 00:56:30,988
making them reality.

892
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,988
Take my hand and reach for the screen,

893
00:56:33,988 --> 00:56:36,721
all we need are glittering dreams.

894
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:38,954
Our hearts and souls

895
00:56:38,954 --> 00:56:42,121
are fulfilled in the world we build.

896
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:46,488
We're ready to seize the day,

897
00:56:46,488 --> 00:56:48,921
traversing the path with the shimmering highways

898
00:56:48,921 --> 00:56:51,454
through everywhere.

899
00:56:51,588 --> 00:56:53,288
Step by step,

900
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:56,654
gathering stories that we can share.

901
00:56:57,154 --> 00:56:58,988
Get ready to lead the way,

902
00:56:58,988 --> 00:57:00,754
with each generation,

903
00:57:00,754 --> 00:57:02,588
a shining sensation, a dream afar.

904
00:57:03,088 --> 00:57:05,088
Let's make fans,

905
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,888
making a moment of history,

906
00:57:07,888 --> 00:57:09,688
joyfully, follow me,

907
00:57:09,688 --> 00:57:13,288
we'll connect the world.

908
00:57:14,588 --> 00:57:16,788
They'll hear our song ringing out

909
00:57:16,788 --> 00:57:19,421
over hills and oceans,

910
00:57:19,421 --> 00:57:22,588
our legend grows and continues.

911
00:57:25,888 --> 00:57:28,521
We'll carry on, starting now,

912
00:57:28,521 --> 00:57:31,488
setting hearts in motion,

913
00:57:31,488 --> 00:57:35,421
connecting all of the world.

914
00:57:49,254 --> 00:57:51,421
Yeah!

915
00:57:52,654 --> 00:57:56,588
Thank you so much to everyone here today!

916
00:57:56,588 --> 00:58:00,088
How have you liked our 3D showcase

917
00:58:00,088 --> 00:58:02,588
with #Advent3D? Let's see your comments!

918
00:58:04,321 --> 00:58:07,588
And we had a lot of challenges

919
00:58:07,588 --> 00:58:10,588
and so much fun performing live to everyone, right?

920
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:17,588
Thanks to all of you, it was a really exciting 3D showcase!

921
00:58:18,521 --> 00:58:22,088
And we can't wait to see you all

922
00:58:22,088 --> 00:58:24,388
in 3D for future concerts and events!

923
00:58:25,221 --> 00:58:28,088
We hope that you'll continue to watch

924
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:31,088
Advent really closely and help us here on our journey!

925
00:58:33,488 --> 00:58:35,088
But, but...

926
00:58:35,388 --> 00:58:36,488
Oh?

927
00:58:36,488 --> 00:58:39,088
Last but not least, we have some merch to reveal, don't we, Advent?

928
00:58:39,121 --> 00:58:40,488
Yeah!

929
00:58:40,488 --> 00:58:43,788
So, why don't we go and take our first look, huh?

930
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,588
Oh, I wonder what it is?

931
00:58:46,588 --> 00:58:48,288
Yeah, what could it be?

932
00:58:55,721 --> 00:58:56,588
Tada!

933
00:58:56,088 --> 00:59:02,088
Shiori Novella Matching Belt

934
00:58:59,688 --> 00:59:02,588
It's the belt! That's right guys!

935
00:59:03,321 --> 00:59:07,088
If you ever want something for your pants

936
00:59:07,088 --> 00:59:10,588
or other things that I can't talk about, boy, you can have a Shiori-ish belt!

937
00:59:15,088 --> 00:59:17,488
Yes, so super cool!

938
00:59:17,521 --> 00:59:18,588

Just like me, the pebbles!

942
00:59:31,154 --> 00:59:33,088
Aren't they beautiful?

943
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:35,388
So pretty, I want my own pair!

944
00:59:35,421 --> 00:59:38,288
Yeah! They'll be comfortable!

945
00:59:38,288 --> 00:59:41,088
Do they make that 'clink' sound when you walk?

946
00:59:41,121 --> 00:59:44,088
Right! You'll have to get it to find out!

947
00:59:44,654 --> 00:59:48,088
Get multiple so you can lick one and use one!

948
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:50,088
What? Like a lollipop!

949
00:59:50,654 --> 00:59:53,088
Okay, Shiori, let's see what's next! Here we go!

950

ネリッサ・レイヴンクロフト

01:00:15,096 --> 01:00:18,996

Keyholder with my tail! I'm a tail!

967
01:00:52,096 --> 01:00:54,896

Pokey Hand In Cushion

971
01:01:02,696 --> 01:01:08,596
Next we have, as you met today, Pokey, our cute mascot for all of Advent and the Advent-trix.

972
01:01:08,796 --> 01:01:13,396
It is a hand cushion. So if your hands are cold, you can warm them up...

973
01:01:13,596 --> 01:01:17,396
...or if you're taking a nap, you can lay on it.

974
01:01:17,596 --> 01:01:22,396
It's perfect for all sorts of pillowy transportation needs.

975
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:26,396
So do consider getting your own Pokey and beat him up!

976
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:29,696
Don't beat him up!

977

984
01:02:07,596 --> 01:02:11,896
How often are you going to be able to get our 3D debut merch? Not often, I think.

985
01:02:12,096 --> 01:02:15,396
So don't miss out on it, because I'm pretty sure it's limited, right?

986
01:02:15,596 --> 01:02:22,596
It's in 3D! Triple D! It's the time! Now's the time!

987
01:02:23,096 --> 01:02:26,596
Now do we have any messages for everyone?

01:02:26,796 --> 01:02:33,896
I just wanted to say thank you so much to all the Advent-trix for making this dream of ours come true!

989
01:02:34,096 --> 01:02:36,896
Bau bau, thank you!

990
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:44,396
And as for me, I just want to say thank you for supporting us and helping me not die!

991
01:02:44,596 --> 01:02:48,396
So yeah! I don't feel shaky anymore! Whoo!

992
01:02:48,596 --> 01:02:54,096
Seriously, without all of your guy's love and support, we wouldn't be able to be standing on this stage today.

993
01:02:54,296 --> 01:03:03,596
So thank you for loving us, thank you for loving me, thank you for loving Advent and hololive and for being here today for our special first 3D collaboration.

994
01:03:05,596 --> 01:03:12,896
And Mococo... I'm a bit nervous, but... thank you from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much.

995
01:03:13,096 --> 01:03:20,596
You know we really couldn't do it without you. And I really hope that you'll think that 'Wow, I really like Advent, I like them even more after today!'

996
01:03:21,096 --> 01:03:26,596
So please continue to support us and we'll do our best, okay? Bau bau!

997
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:34,096
And last but not least... Watch out Advent-trix, Advent's at full power now, we're in 3D!

998
01:03:34,296 --> 01:03:42,596
It's not the end, it's just the beginning. So please keep supporting us, okay? Thank you everyone!

999
01:03:43,096 --> 01:03:49,096
Thank you, thank you! I hope you had an amazing time today!

1000
01:03:49,596 --> 01:03:54,096
Keep smiling! This was hololive English -Advent-!

1001
01:03:55,096 --> 01:04:05,096
Bye-bye darlings! Bau bau! Bau bau bau!
