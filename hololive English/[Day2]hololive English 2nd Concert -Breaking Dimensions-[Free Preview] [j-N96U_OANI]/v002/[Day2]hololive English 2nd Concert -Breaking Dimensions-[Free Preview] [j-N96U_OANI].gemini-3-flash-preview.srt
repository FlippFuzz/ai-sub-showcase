Start the fire

122

I'm out of sync

123
00:42:35,965 --> 00:42:39,665

Of saddled stories wearing me down

124
00:42:39,665 --> 00:42:42,665

Break out, give it everything

And then over again

143
00:43:39,165 --> 00:43:41,665
Step out of the circle
Break out, we've got everything

144
00:43:41,665 --> 00:43:46,165

145

00:45:17,607 --> 00:45:18,708
Last time!

164
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:22,245
Jump into the stream of life! Dance, dance!

165
00:45:22,245 --> 00:45:25,782
空え 誰のステージへ
To the sky, to whose stage?

166

Higher, higher as you desire
Time to get this party started!

170

Let me hear you New York!

171
00:46:13,116 --> 00:46:17,020
Ticked out from the sky to the deepest hell
If you survived down below where the darkness dwells

172
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:21,224
So deep that you can't even hear the bells
All along what a mess couldn't even tell

173
00:46:21,224 --> 00:46:25,161
Yeah, the second coming, yeah, the lightning
I've cut into the sky so frightening

異次元に生きる人間に
To humans living in another dimension

175
00:46:29,165 --> 00:46:31,134

Oh you humans so naive and desperate.

177
00:46:35,538 --> 00:46:39,409
Enough to think that luck and fate have favorites.

00:46:52,922 --> 00:46:57,360
Heed the mark of chaos the gainer

182
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:01,698

Ever, after, higher

183

191
00:47:36,165 --> 00:47:40,203
Now let's tonight my awakening
So strange that you can't stop shivering

192
00:47:40,203 --> 00:47:44,808
Don't stay silent for second in
All your climbing up my body in unison a pattern

193
00:47:44,808 --> 00:47:48,645
Hey, listen now, wait up for me
Baby, I should look around

00:47:48,645 --> 00:47:54,217
奇跡の光は 永遠の愛
The light of miracles is eternal love

195
00:47:54,517 --> 00:47:58,588

Do you want to climb to the sky?

200

Take off on the depth for the fire.

If you really want to win and take everything.

202
00:48:24,714 --> 00:48:27,684
Look within and begin. Gekidou, you feel.

203
00:48:27,684 --> 00:48:31,688
A burning wrath that makes the heart freeze.

204
00:48:31,688 --> 00:48:35,692
You face creatures from a deep dark sea.

205
00:48:35,692 --> 00:48:39,629
Your faith will grow like lava and bloom from a seed.

206

209
00:48:52,775 --> 00:48:57,647
Heed the mark of chaos the gainer

210
00:48:57,647 --> 00:49:01,751

Ever, after, higher

211

Bring it, bring it, Gekidou

00:53:40,207 --> 00:53:42,207
Do you like Rebellion?

Oh, I don't think that was loud enough. Yell more, please!

279
00:53:46,707 --> 00:53:49,707
Yeah, come on! It's our first time as Advent performing together.

280
00:53:49,707 --> 00:53:51,707
Yeah, did you like it?

281
00:53:51,707 --> 00:53:53,707
Oh, you ripped my ears.

282
00:53:53,707 --> 00:53:55,207
That's what I thought.

283
00:53:55,707 --> 00:53:58,707
Well, I guess we should do some introductions first, maybe?

284
00:53:58,707 --> 00:54:01,707
Yeah, like who are you and who am I?

285
00:54:01,707 --> 00:54:03,707
Yeah, I'm not really sure anymore, honestly.

286
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:06,207
I'm not really sure either. Well, why don't you go first?

287
00:54:06,207 --> 00:54:09,207

00:54:23,707 --> 00:54:26,207
Yeah, let's make some noise tonight!

294
00:54:26,707 --> 00:54:30,707
Well, you know... Oh yes, that's music to my ears.

295
00:54:30,707 --> 00:54:35,207
Honestly, same. This venue... can we just take a moment to appreciate it?

296
00:54:35,207 --> 00:54:37,207
It's gorgeous!

297
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:39,207
It looks also kind of haunted.

298
00:54:39,207 --> 00:54:41,707
Yeah, it does look a little bit haunted.

299
00:54:41,707 --> 00:54:44,207
What should we do with it? We should summon a ghost.

300
00:54:44,207 --> 00:54:46,707
You... I mean, I'm already a demon, so...

301
00:54:46,707 --> 00:54:49,707
I choose... why don't we summon a prettier ghost?

302
00:54:49,707 --> 00:54:52,207
You said you're a demon! That's fine!

303
00:54:52,207 --> 00:54:55,207
My heart! You just killed me in front of everyone!

304
00:54:55,207 --> 00:54:58,207
Even in the haunt! No, I'll make it up to you.

305
00:54:58,207 --> 00:54:59,207
Here, here, just turn around.

306
00:55:03,953 --> 00:55:06,253
I got her nose!

307
00:55:05,753 --> 00:55:06,753
No!

308
00:55:07,753 --> 00:55:10,253
I can't breathe! Help me!

309
00:55:10,753 --> 00:55:12,053
I got your nose!

310
00:55:12,253 --> 00:55:13,053
Give it back!

311
00:55:13,053 --> 00:55:14,053
Okay, here you go.

312
00:55:14,053 --> 00:55:15,053
Thank you.

313
00:55:16,653 --> 00:55:17,753
Well...

314
00:55:21,253 --> 00:55:25,753
We wanted to do some call and responses with you guys, if that's okay.

315
00:55:28,753 --> 00:55:32,253
So how I like to summon ghosts is by being like really annoying.

316
00:55:32,353 --> 00:55:34,753
So I think we should recite the lyrics, right?

317
00:55:34,853 --> 00:55:36,053
Yes!

318
00:55:36,153 --> 00:55:38,453
So we're gonna say "Fire Fire",

319
00:55:38,453 --> 00:55:42,253
and then right after, you're gonna say "Light the fire", got it everyone?

320
00:55:42,253 --> 00:55:44,453
That's supposed to make ghosts come out.

321
00:55:46,853 --> 00:55:48,253
Alright.

322
00:55:48,353 --> 00:55:49,653
One, two, three.

323
00:55:49,653 --> 00:55:51,253
Fire, fire!

324
00:55:54,253 --> 00:55:56,253
I don't think that was loud enough. Let's do one more.

325
00:55:56,253 --> 00:55:57,253
Yeah, yeah. Okay, countdown.

326
00:55:57,553 --> 00:55:58,953
One, two, three.

327
00:55:58,953 --> 00:56:00,553
Fire, fire!

328
00:56:04,253 --> 00:56:05,753
That's what I'm talking about!

329
00:56:05,853 --> 00:56:07,053
I can feel the spirits.

330
00:56:07,653 --> 00:56:09,853
Um, I want to do one more actually, selfishly of me.

331
00:56:10,053 --> 00:56:10,753
Oh, okay.

332
00:56:10,853 --> 00:56:14,553
I mean, it's not really a call and response, but I just want the audience for- for me, for myself...

333
00:56:14,653 --> 00:56:17,053
...I just want to hear you all say "Ope". I'm gonna do a countdown.

334
00:56:17,153 --> 00:56:18,753
Can you all just say "Ope" for me?

335
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:23,253
But- but can you tell us the origin of "Ope"? Like a really quick summary.

336
00:56:24,253 --> 00:56:27,253
"Ope" is just an- an expression, like "Oh", of surprise.

337
00:56:27,253 --> 00:56:28,253
It's like "Oh!"

338
00:56:28,253 --> 00:56:29,253
Yeah, "Ope!"

339
00:56:29,253 --> 00:56:30,053
Oh!

340
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:31,053
Ope!

341
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:33,453
You don't have to sound surprised. You can just say "Ope" though.

342
00:56:33,553 --> 00:56:35,653
Okay, on three. I won't make you do it twice,

343
00:56:35,653 --> 00:56:37,953
so you got one try. Can you get it for me?

344
00:56:38,053 --> 00:56:38,953
One shot, okay, okay.

345
00:56:39,053 --> 00:56:41,053
One, two, three!

346
00:56:43,253 --> 00:56:48,253
Yeah! Heck yeah!

347
00:56:49,253 --> 00:56:52,253
Well, you know, we're here for "Breaking Dimensions".

348
00:56:52,253 --> 00:56:57,253
Yeah. Talk about what- what does "Breaking Dimensions" mean to you?

349
00:57:00,853 --> 00:57:03,253
Yes, and we're to be gone!

350
00:57:04,253 --> 00:57:06,453
You okay? Yeah, good. Just keep talking.

351
00:57:06,453 --> 00:57:11,253
Okay, okay. Wow, wow. What- what "Breaking Dimensions" means to me...

352
00:57:11,353 --> 00:57:15,253
...but, uh... I feel like it's a physical achievement because this is our first concert.

353
00:57:15,353 --> 00:57:17,253
Yeah, really. And I kind of feel the same.

354
00:57:17,353 --> 00:57:21,253
It's like, I feel like this is solidifying our existence being here, right?

355
00:57:21,353 --> 00:57:22,253
Yeah.

356
00:57:22,353 --> 00:57:25,753
Like, you know, we've been in Hololive for about a year, but now it feels really, really official...

357
00:57:25,853 --> 00:57:30,753
...standing before you, seeing you guys out in the audience, up there, and online too.

358
00:57:31,253 --> 00:57:32,253
Yeah. Hi guys.

359
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:35,253
Hey, I'm walking here!

360
00:57:35,253 --> 00:57:37,253
Yeah, move it! I'm walking here!

361
00:57:37,753 --> 00:57:40,253
But it's- it's really great to be here because like, it feels- it feels so real, right?

362
00:57:40,353 --> 00:57:42,753
Yeah, it really does feel real. It's real!

363
00:57:43,253 --> 00:57:46,253
You guys, it's like I could touch you.

364
00:57:46,253 --> 00:57:51,253
The accident wasn't my fault!

365
00:57:51,253 --> 00:57:56,253
But I'm so happy to be here with all of Advent, but especially with my...

366
00:57:56,353 --> 00:57:57,753
...beloved Shiori Novella.

367
00:57:57,753 --> 00:58:00,253
Who's a good girl? Who's my little PogChamp?

368
00:58:00,253 --> 00:58:03,753
Who's my PogChamp? What's wrong with me?

369
00:58:06,753 --> 00:58:08,053
I don't know, there's a lot.

370
00:58:08,153 --> 00:58:10,253
Yeah, I... same, honestly.

371
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,253
Okay, cool.

372
00:58:13,253 --> 00:58:15,253
Well, we're having a great time.

373
00:58:15,253 --> 00:58:19,053
Uh, we do have some potentially maybe bad news...

374
00:58:19,253 --> 00:58:23,253
...which is if you are at this point of the concert watching online...

375
00:58:23,253 --> 00:58:28,253
...this is where the free portion of the show ends.

376
00:58:28,353 --> 00:58:30,053
That's right!

377
00:58:30,153 --> 00:58:34,253
No more sneak-peeking! No more sneaking and no more peeking, in that order.

378
00:58:34,753 --> 00:58:37,253
Yep. So if you're gonna want to watch the rest of the concert and you're online...

379
00:58:37,253 --> 00:58:41,253
...be sure to head over to SPWN and you can get a ticket and watch the rest of the concert...

380
00:58:41,253 --> 00:58:48,253
...if you want to see uh, my solo performance today, as well as everybody else's amazing performances.

381
00:58:48,353 --> 00:58:50,253
Yeah! It's gonna be so many wonderful songs.

382
00:58:50,353 --> 00:58:52,753
So that's right! Go for purchases, let's go!

383
00:58:53,253 --> 00:58:54,253
Yeah!

384
00:58:56,253 --> 00:58:59,253
But, I... should- should we do the thing?

385
00:58:59,253 --> 00:59:00,253
Oh, that's right! Yeah.

386
00:59:00,353 --> 00:59:02,253
Alright, let's fuse. Okay.

387
00:59:02,353 --> 00:59:04,753
Everyone, I hope you enjoy...

388
00:59:04,853 --> 00:59:08,753
