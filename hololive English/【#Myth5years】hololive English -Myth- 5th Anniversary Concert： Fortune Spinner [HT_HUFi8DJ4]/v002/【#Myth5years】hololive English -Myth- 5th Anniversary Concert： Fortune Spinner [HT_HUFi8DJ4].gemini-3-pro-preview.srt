00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, we reached the destination.

3
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,900
Right on time.

4
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,900
Is everyone ready?

5
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,700
You bet. Let's go.

6
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,200
All right then! Ready?

7
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,800
Set...

8
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,800
Jump!

9
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,400
Coming in hot!

10
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,300
We're ready to greet the world

11
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,100
We're voyaging forward

12
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,700
with courage to run toward a brand new start

13
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,200
Let's go live

14
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,800
bridging the distance across the sea

15
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,200
Endlessly

16
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,800
cheerfully

17
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,200
meeting heart to heart!

18
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,100
Look up at the horizon together as one

19
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,400
A star is on the rise and it's only begun

20
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
The pivot of the moment we're clamoring for

21
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,100
An infinite future's at our door

22
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,900
Yeah!

23
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,000
It's a timeless story with a new feel

24
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,700
Not just allegory, it's real

25
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,300
Wake up!

26
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,900
Big dreams about to come true

27
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,800
That means it's time to break through

28
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,200
Never knew we could make it so far

29
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,900
But we're striving, thriving, here we are

30
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,200
Achieving the impossible

31
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,800
We're virtually unstoppable

32
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,900
We can't sit still, we just keep moving

33
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,800
Now everybody sing

34
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,100
We're making our way to the next dimension

35
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,200
We'll reinvent the world that we live in

36
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,700
We'll greet every day with new intentions

37
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,900
Break conventions, run right through!

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,800
(This is it!)

39
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,900
It's smashing barriers left and right

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,900
(That's our Myth!)

41
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,200
Strong as we ever were, scaling heights

42
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,100
(It's endless!)

43
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,300
So get together, let's reunite!

44
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,200
Reach up, reach out, the future's bright!

45
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:06,368
We're ready to seize the day

46
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:08,428
traversing the pathways

47
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:10,968
discovering highways to everywhere

48
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:12,408
Step by step

49
00:05:12,408 --> 00:05:13,128
Yeah!

50
00:05:13,128 --> 00:05:15,848
gathering stories that we can share!

51
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,448
Get ready to lead the way

52
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:20,148
with this generation

53
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:22,548
a shining sensation, a dream unfurls

54
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:23,748
Let's make friends

55
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:24,448
Yeah!

56
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:27,248
making a moment of history

57
00:05:27,248 --> 00:05:28,948
Joyfully

58
00:05:28,948 --> 00:05:30,348
Follow me!

59
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:33,848
We'll connect the world!

60
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:35,448
You'll hear our song

61
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:37,048
ringing out

62
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:39,448
over hills and oceans

63
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:41,448
Our legend grows

64
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:44,848
and continues!

65
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:46,448
We'll carry on

66
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:48,048
starting now

67
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,648
setting hearts in motion

68
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:55,048
Connecting all of the world!

69
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:05,848
We're making our way to the next dimension

70
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:08,848
We're living out the dreams we believe in

71
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:11,848
Excitement beyond our comprehension

72
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:14,648
There's no question we'll break through

73
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:15,248
(Don't relent!)

74
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:18,048
We'll keep aspiring to excel

75
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:18,548
(That's our myth!)

76
00:06:18,548 --> 00:06:21,448
It's awe-inspiring, going well

77
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,048
(Represent!)

78
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,848
So light the fire and let's rebel

79
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:28,048
The future's brighter, we can tell!

80
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:35,048
We're ready to...

81
00:06:40,248 --> 00:06:44,048
We're ready to change the world!

82
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:53,048
Yay!

83
00:06:53,048 --> 00:06:55,548
Uh uh uh uh uh

84
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,248
Myth medley! Myth medley! Myth medley! Myth medley!

85
00:06:58,248 --> 00:06:59,248
What are you doing?

86
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:00,048
I... I...

87
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:01,248
Oh, you too?

88
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:03,048
Both of you guys are acting a little strange right now.

89
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,848
We're doing crazy shapes!

90
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:06,048
Why are they being so stiff?

91
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:07,548
Come on, those shoulders too.

92
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:08,548
You gotta shoulder too.

93
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:11,548
Ina come on, come on!

94
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:13,048
頑張れ！
Do your best!

95
00:07:13,548 --> 00:07:15,548
I know the floor is nice but...

96
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:17,048
It is really nice.

97
00:07:17,048 --> 00:07:18,248
It's smooth.

98
00:07:18,248 --> 00:07:19,048
皆さん！
Everyone!

99
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:21,048
Minna-san thank you for coming to the show today...
Everyone thank you for coming to the show today...

100
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:23,048
...to celebrate Myth's... you guessed it...

101
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:24,548
5th Anniversary!

102
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:25,848
Woo! Yippee!

103
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:27,548
It was a medley... a nice throwback.

104
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,548
We've made so many songs together.

105
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:31,248
Yeah, 懐かしい.
Yeah, nostalgic.

106
00:07:31,248 --> 00:07:34,548
Putting it all together like that is like really... emotional.

107
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:36,548
エモエモ.
Emo emo.

108
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:39,548
And it's not just like our 5th year anniversary...

109
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:42,548
It's also Hololive English as a whole, 5 years!

110
00:07:42,548 --> 00:07:43,548
Yeah!

111
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:45,048
Don't do that!

112
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,048
We're old!

113
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,048
We're all... 5!

114
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:49,048
You know?

115
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:52,048
We also... we also achieved so much in the last 5 years you know?

116
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:55,048
We had three EN concerts...

117
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:57,048
My voice cracked, let's go!

118
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:58,048
Let's go!

119
00:07:58,048 --> 00:08:02,048
And we had a lot of friends join us over the years...

120
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:05,048
...and in the end I'm just really happy to be performing with you guys.

121
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:06,048
It's so much fun.

122
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:07,048
Yeah!

123
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:11,048
Can't get too emotional just yet though because we have a show to do.

124
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:13,048
Mmh, mmh. It's true.

125
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:15,048
Yes, anyways, anyways, anyways...

126
00:08:15,048 --> 00:08:17,048
There's a hashtag right here, right here.

127
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:18,048
Yes yes.

128
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:22,048
Over here. Take lots of pictures, uh, screenshots and post them on social media.

129
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:23,548
Hashtag #Myth5years!

130
00:08:23,548 --> 00:08:24,548
Make us trend!

131
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:25,548
Trending, get it trending.

132
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:26,848
Number one!

133
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,048
If you want, you don't have to if you don't want to.

134
00:08:29,048 --> 00:08:31,048
Just kidding, if you don't do it we'll be sad.

135
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:32,048
We'll be angry. We'll get you.

136
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:33,048
Do it.

137
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:34,048
Okay.

138
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:37,048
Besides that everybody... this is important. I'm just checking.

139
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:40,048
Making sure you guys are all here legally.

140
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:42,048
ジャジャーン！
Ta-da!

141
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:43,048
あら！
Oh my!

142
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:45,048
Did you guys all receive a ticket?

143
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:47,048
Oh I remember that.

144
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:49,048
Ah, it's me! That's me!

145
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:51,048
We look so cool.

146
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:54,048
Yeah I think I gave you mine at the bar...

147
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:56,048
It was kinda spicy, remember?

148
00:08:56,048 --> 00:08:57,048
Whoa. Spicy?

149
00:08:57,048 --> 00:09:00,048
I accosted you on the street, yeah if you remember.

150
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:01,048
Ah right...

151
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:03,048
Oh that's what you were up to.

152
00:09:03,048 --> 00:09:07,048
Yeah, yeah, I... I might have tres... trespassed?

153
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:08,048
What?

154
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,548
おやおや？
Oh my?

155
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:11,548
Wait what did you do?

156
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:12,548
Ina would do such a thing!

157
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:14,048
Don't worry about it don't worry about it!

158
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:16,048
That was our alter egos.

159
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:17,048
That's right, that's right.

160
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:20,048
Okay. Well... Ninomae Ina'anis?

161
00:09:20,048 --> 00:09:21,048
What? Sorry.

162
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:24,048
What did you do? You want to share?

163
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:26,548
Nothing. I did nothing illegal.

164
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:29,048
Fine. Don't tell me, keep your secrets.

165
00:09:30,048 --> 00:09:30,848
Wow.

166
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:33,048
That's fine. They're used to it. It's been five years.

167
00:09:33,048 --> 00:09:37,048
Now that we know that everybody is here with their tickets and they're allowed to be here...

168
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:40,048
We'll be singing a lot on this stage today...

169
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:44,048
in different combinations and different fun songs and so on.

170
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:46,048
But speaking of the stage...

171
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:47,048
Oh yeah!

172
00:09:47,048 --> 00:09:48,048
Look at this stage!

173
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:49,048
Look smooth floor.

174
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:50,048
Beautiful stage.

175
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,048
Gorgeous.

176
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,048
おしゃれ！
Stylish!

177
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:53,048
Look at the chairs, that's fancy.

178
00:09:53,048 --> 00:09:54,048
How much does that cost?

179
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:55,548
Couch, can I lie on it?

180
00:09:56,048 --> 00:09:57,048
Get your priorities straight.

181
00:09:57,048 --> 00:09:58,048
Whoa look at that chandelier!

182
00:09:58,048 --> 00:09:59,048
Can I swing on it?

183
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,048
No!

184
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:02,048
Do not swing on the chandelier!

185
00:10:04,223 --> 00:10:05,573
What's the heart for?

186
00:10:05,573 --> 00:10:06,723
Looks expensive.

187
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:08,623
Wait, did it just change color?

188
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:10,223
If we could just gain some color.

189
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:11,323
Ah, why I wonder?

190
00:10:11,323 --> 00:10:15,423
Could it be that it's reacting to everybody's reactions in the chat?

191
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,523
And their feelings, it's changing color according to that?

192
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:21,923
Are you guys getting excited?

193
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,623
Chat, you guys have an important job to do now, right?

194
00:10:26,623 --> 00:10:29,023
Which is doing things, they're always doing something.

195
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:30,423
It must be their power...

196
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:32,123
...and their energy.

197
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:33,823
It's flowing through us!

198
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:36,623
Well I look forward to seeing how it develops from here out.

199
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:37,923
So, you know what you're gonna do right?

200
00:10:37,923 --> 00:10:41,323
You're gonna get out your keyboards and you're gonna type some things.

201
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:43,123
Type-o-man!

202
00:10:45,123 --> 00:10:46,623
Give us your energy!

203
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:48,123
Give it to us!

204
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:49,923
Not like we're trying to shake you down or anything.

205
00:10:49,923 --> 00:10:51,423
I feel it, I feel it.

206
00:10:51,423 --> 00:10:52,623
I'll shake them down.

207
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:54,023
Okay, alright, we're choosing violence again today.

208
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:55,323
Why are you so violent?

209
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:57,223
In a violent mood.

210
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,623
We should be wholesome and teetee.

211
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:00,423
I'm just really happy to be here.

212
00:11:00,423 --> 00:11:01,423
Five years...

213
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:02,423
Five years later she's done.

214
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:04,023
Oh no they know the real me now.

215
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:05,223
Sorry, I'm sorry.

216
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,123
Sounds eager though, I apologize.

217
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:11,823
Well, there's not a lot of time for yapping too much today it would seem.

218
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:14,423
We're gonna dance our hearts out, sing our hearts out for you guys.

219
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:17,423
Oh man, we've been doing a lot of that these days.

220
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:20,823
I think everybody in Myth deserves a trophy.

221
00:11:20,823 --> 00:11:22,123
A little reward perhaps?

222
00:11:22,123 --> 00:11:23,623
A treat perhaps?

223
00:11:23,623 --> 00:11:24,523
Cookies?

224
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:25,623
Cookies are good too.

225
00:11:25,623 --> 00:11:26,623
Cookies sound good too.

226
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:29,023
Maybe a cookie shaped tro... or a trophy made out of a cookie?

227
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:31,023
Or a trophy shaped cookie.

228
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,523
Oh!

229
00:11:32,523 --> 00:11:33,923
You hear that management?

230
00:11:33,923 --> 00:11:36,623
You better be having some rewards for us!

231
00:11:36,623 --> 00:11:37,423
We demanding!

232
00:11:37,423 --> 00:11:38,323
Yeah, so demanding.

233
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,023
Wow, that's fun.

234
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:42,623
That's okay, in that case I know how we can kick this off.

235
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:43,423
Kick it off?

236
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:46,123
Yeah, so maybe it's like a little cheesy.

237
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:49,123
But I thought maybe the three of us could like jump in the air and go 'Weee!'

238
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:52,623
Like 3, 2, 1, jump! And then the camera goes 'Vwoom!'

239
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:54,723
Like flying in the air and go to the next song.

240
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:55,823
I get it, I get it.

241
00:11:55,823 --> 00:11:57,123
I get you.

242
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:58,323
Done it before.

243
00:11:58,323 --> 00:11:59,323
Then let's do it.

244
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:02,623
No punching, no violent thoughts Ina.

245
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:04,323
Don't punch the camera, I know what you're thinking.

246
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,223
Just one uppercut?

247
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:06,723
Not one, not... at zero!

248
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:08,123
Let's do it, okay?

249
00:12:08,623 --> 00:12:09,623
On my count.

250
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:11,323

00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,510
この気持ちはそう
This feeling is, yes,

509
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,410
この気持ちにしか
only this feeling

510
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,410
きっとわかんないから
can surely understand.

511
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,510
君と手と手繋いで
Holding hand in hand with you,

512
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,710
ひとつひとつ叶えてゆこう
let's make them come true one by one.

520
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,110
誰も知らない
A pure white page

521
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,610
真っ白なページ
that no one knows,

522
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,810
更新して
I will go on

523
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,210
ゆく
updating it.

524
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,210
話したくない
The tear I don't

525
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,510
綻びは
want to talk about...

526
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,010
離したくない
With the joy I don't

527
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,410
喜びで
want to let go,

528
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,810
継ぎ接ぎだらけの
this heart full of patches,

529
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,310
この心
I spun and spun,

530
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,610
紡ぎ紡ぎ
the place

531
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,310
繋いだ所
I connected.

532
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,310
憧れ恋焦がれ
Admiring, yearning,

533
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,910
待ち焦がれ全部全部全部
waiting impatiently, everything everything!

534
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,910
プリンみたいに
Flip it over

535
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,110
ひっくり返して
like a pudding.

536
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,410
Caramel caramel my own flavor

537
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,810
どこ痛いそこ痛い
Where does it hurt? It hurts there.

538
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,310
切り離したままじゃ僕はパズルのピース
Left separated, I am just a puzzle piece.

539
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,610
でもそんなんじゃやだ
But I don't want that!

540
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,710
でもそんなんじゃダメ
But that's no good!

541
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,110
僕はキメ顔でせーの
I pose with a cool face, ready set!

542
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,110
好きの切り札は
The trump card of love,

543
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,910
自分で選ぶの
I choose it myself.

544
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,010
運命の赤い
Pulling in the red

545
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,010
リボンを手繰り寄せて
ribbon of fate.

546
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,910
この気持ちはそう
This feeling is, yes,

547
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,910

00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,510
Welcome back Calli!

568
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,610
Oh, hi. Hey.

569
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,310
You guys look a little tired.

570
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,910
I thought we were posing for the Myth album cover...

571
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,210
...which is not coming out by the way.

572
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,610
Don't misunderstand.

573
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,910
Did you guys enjoy the song so far?

574
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,610
Yeah...

575
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,510
Was pretty fire.

576
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,010
Yeah yeah yeah.

577
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,110
We did a really cute one Ina.

578
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,210
Caramel Ribbon Cursetard.

579
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,310
Yeah...

580
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,110
You guys's voices...

581
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,410
...fit really really well with that song.

582
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,110
Oh thank you.

583
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,510
Yeah, it's a really cute song.

584
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,410
Yeah. I...

585
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,910
...me and Ina were like "What song should we do together?"

586
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,910
And I was like...

587
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,310
..."Oh, I wonder if Ina would let me do a Monogatari song?"

588
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,210
I was like "Monogatari please!"

589
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,310
And she's like "Naisu!"

590
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,710
Wait wait wait wait.

591
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,310
You're talking to Ninomae Ina'nis you know.

592
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,010
Of course I'm gonna say yeah.

593
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,110
Right right. Cause we all like Monogatari right?

594
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,110
We do. Yeah.

595
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,710
Calli would have done it too huh?

596
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,410
Sure, yeah I would have done it.

597
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,310
We could have had her doing the...

598
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:16,910
I can do it now. Uh.

599
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,510
Ah, I should have done it as three people.

600
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,610
Then you got even more cute.

601
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,510
But we also tried to be cute as we can.

602
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,110
We got everybody's solos though.

603
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,610
Yeah. Except mine. We don't know anything about those.

604
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,010
You guys know I could rap that fast?

605
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,910
Like, I was surprised.

606
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,010
Impressive.

607
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,310
Yeah. Maa maa maa.

608
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,610
Kakkoii Kiara.

609
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,610
I did my best. It was like enough...

610
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,310
...enough to... I was like "Oh, you know, she did it."

611
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,110
And plus the dancing was pretty cool so.

612
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,010
Oh yeah.

613
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:41,810
Gambatta.

614
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,910
Good job. And Ina too, very impressive.

615
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,410
Oh my goodness, I really challenged myself.

616
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,610
The dancing has leveled up so much.

617
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,610
Yeah.

618
00:30:03,616 --> 00:30:05,266
Through the roof... but...

619
00:30:05,266 --> 00:30:06,066
We did it.

620
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:06,766
We did it.

621
00:30:06,766 --> 00:30:08,866
And then, me and Ina did some air guitar.

622
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:10,316
Yeah, bringing out the guitar!

623
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:12,866
My original song, Sepia.

624
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:14,816
Very close song to my heart.

625
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:16,966
Yeah, I love the purple guitar.

626
00:30:19,616 --> 00:30:21,166
What's still missing now?

627
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,366
Well there are a couple songs missing, aren't there?

628
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:28,116
Like the Wah-Wah... So... My So... So...

629
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:30,966
Mine and Calli's combination... song?

630
00:30:30,966 --> 00:30:32,566
I wonder...

631
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:34,166
What you guys are gonna sing?

632
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,966
I wonder... I wonder...

633
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:39,966
I will just say that the song for me and Calli was also chosen...

634
00:30:39,966 --> 00:30:41,966
kind of by... suggested by me.

635
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,066
Thank you for being okay with it.

636
00:30:44,366 --> 00:30:46,166
It's a nice song.

637
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:49,166
I guess, yeah, I don't wanna spoil anything but...

638
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:50,166
That was pretty good.

639
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:55,366
And my solo will be... uh... epic.

640
00:30:55,366 --> 00:30:56,366
And hype.

641
00:30:56,366 --> 00:30:57,366
Why did you choose it?

642
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:58,666
Can you give a hint?

643
00:30:58,666 --> 00:30:59,866
I know it's about to happen pretty soon, but...

644
00:31:00,966 --> 00:31:03,166
No! No! Damn it!

645
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,366
No! Alright, alright.

646
00:31:04,366 --> 00:31:05,266
Why?

647
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:09,766
Yes, we still have a lot of a show left over, so...

648
00:31:09,766 --> 00:31:11,366
Don't tune out.

649
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:12,866
There's lots more.

650
00:31:12,866 --> 00:31:14,066
Stay with us.

651
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:15,066
Stay right there.

652
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:16,066
Don't move.

653
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:16,966
Wait!

654
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:19,566
And continue to watch until the end.

655
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:21,166
And use the hashtag, don't forget that.

656
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:22,166
Okay, hashtag.

657
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:23,366
Are we ready to move on?

658
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:24,066
Move on.

659
00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:24,866
Okay.

660
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:26,366
What should we do?

661
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:27,866
We should...

662
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:29,466
We should play with the camera.

663
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:30,466
I know what to do.

664
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:32,266
What do you want to do the most right now?

665
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,566
I know what to do!

666
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:36,866
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

667
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:38,366
Not something violent, right?

668
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,366
Okay.

669
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,066
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Hey!

670
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:52,566
Dear God,

671
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:55,366
I've come to repent my sins.

672
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:58,866
Let your blood wash me clean for I'm...

673
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:00,766
I'm... I'm...

674
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:04,666
I'm a rotten girl.

675
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:07,366
I swore I'd never sin again.

676
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:10,066
But my patience running thin...

677
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:13,466
Such a temptation flowing through my veins.

678
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:16,266
Bounded by these shackles of shame.

679
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:19,166
I promised I'd indulge no more.

680
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:22,166
But my heart I can't ignore.

681
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:24,966
In my dreams they're turning up the heat.

682
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:27,666
I'm a dirty rotten girl.

683
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:31,066
Unlocked, underneath the bleachers.

684
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:34,066
Just watch, look beyond the smoke and mirrors.

685
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:36,966
Heart struck, shun the non-believers.

686
00:32:37,866 --> 00:32:40,166
Our reparation would never be complete.

687
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:42,666
Red hot, tension with each whisper.

688
00:32:43,866 --> 00:32:45,766
Snapshot, quiet moans and muffled whimpers.

689
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:48,466
Come on, can't you feel the fever,

690
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,366
Rising up, rising up to the sky.

691
00:32:51,566 --> 00:32:54,266
As venom injects the fear, glistening in my skin.

692
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:57,166
The Lord says love thy child, don't give into sin.

693
00:32:57,466 --> 00:33:00,066
It's driving me crazy, the urge to forsake the answer.

694
00:33:00,466 --> 00:33:02,966
Something shifts within this wicked bliss.

695
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:05,266
I swore I'd never sin again.

696
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:08,166
But my patience running thin...

697
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:11,866
Student council breathing down my neck.

698
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:14,566
I wonder if they're hiding from me...

699
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:17,666
Forbidden fruits before my eyes.

700
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:20,566
And a taste that's so divine.

701
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:23,366
My regrets rewriting history.

702
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:25,966
I'm a sad, pathetic girl.

703
00:33:27,866 --> 00:33:29,466
Someone please tell me what to do.

704
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:32,566
Because honestly I just can't stop.

705
00:33:32,766 --> 00:33:35,466
I've been trying so hard and I can't stop.

706
00:33:35,566 --> 00:33:36,866
What would God think?

707
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:40,066
And I, I know I'm supposed to be a good girl but...

708
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:42,266
Somehow I just can't control myself.

709
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:45,766
Every time I see them, touching skin to skin,

710
00:33:45,766 --> 00:33:47,466
my mind goes... my mind goes...

711
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:49,166
Ahhh!

712
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:14,766
Could Eve be our idol?

713
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:16,966
Could she lead us through the light?

714
00:34:16,966 --> 00:34:19,566
With all the disciples of lemon-driven vice.

715
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:21,166
Cause somebody save me,

716
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,666
the urge to forsake the still,

717
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:25,566
Something shifts within this wicked bliss.

718
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:29,966
The power resting in my hands.

719
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:32,866
Oh my god is such a plan.

720
00:34:33,366 --> 00:34:35,966
Until salvation, I can live my life

721
00:34:35,966 --> 00:34:38,366
as an ordinary girl.

722
00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:41,366
I can't resist it anymore.

723
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:44,366
Cause I smell sulfur galore.

724
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:47,466
All the drama from a couple's role.

725
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:49,866
Could never beat the devil in me.

726
00:34:50,266 --> 00:34:52,766
And I'm a sinner till I die.

727
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:55,466
What's the harm if I don't mind?

728
00:34:55,966 --> 00:34:57,766
But the thought that empowers me,

729
00:34:57,766 --> 00:34:59,366
I can live a sinful...

730
00:35:21,649 --> 00:35:23,049
Check, one, two!

731
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:25,949

ガキや若葉
Brats and greenhorns,

855
00:41:25,206 --> 00:41:26,706
まだこっち来んじゃねえよバカ
don't come over here yet, idiot.

856
00:41:26,706 --> 00:41:28,206
今確かに目があったな
Our eyes definitely met just now.

857
00:41:28,206 --> 00:41:29,706
こういうことかよ しょうがない
So that's how it is? Can't be helped.

858
00:41:30,206 --> 00:41:31,706
這い出た 這い出た 這い出た
Crawled out, crawled out, crawled out...

859
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:33,406
這い出た 這い出た 這い出た
Crawled out, crawled out, crawled out...

860
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:34,706

Tired of sleeping,

861
00:41:34,706 --> 00:41:36,006
君が待ってた
you were waiting there.

00:41:36,006 --> 00:41:37,406
縦と横が
If vertical and horizontal...

863
00:41:37,406 --> 00:41:38,706
片抱き合ったら
...embrace one side.

864
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:40,206
光が差したら
If the light shines in.

865
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,706
心 体 頭
Heart, body, head...

866
00:41:42,706 --> 00:41:44,206
みなぎっていく 何だか
...somehow filling up with power.

867
00:41:44,206 --> 00:41:45,406
背中に今 羽が
If wings have grown...

868
00:41:45,406 --> 00:41:46,706
生えたならば
...on my back now,

869
00:41:46,706 --> 00:41:48,206
暗闇からサラバ
farewell to the darkness.

870
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:49,006
ええ
Yeah,

871
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,006
飛び立っていく彼方
flying off to the distance.

872
00:41:51,006 --> 00:41:51,706
ええ
Yeah.

873
00:41:51,706 --> 00:41:53,206
心 体 頭
Heart, body, head...

874
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:54,406
懐かしい温かさ
...a nostalgic warmth.

875
00:41:54,406 --> 00:41:55,706
足元に今 花が
If flowers have bloomed...

876
00:41:55,706 --> 00:41:57,206
咲いたならば
...at my feet now,

877
00:41:57,206 --> 00:41:58,706
暗闇からサラバ
farewell to the darkness.

878
00:41:58,706 --> 00:41:59,406
ええ
Yeah,

879
00:41:59,406 --> 00:42:01,706
飛び立っていく彼方
flying off to the distance.

880
00:42:01,706 --> 00:42:02,706
Hoo!

881
00:42:02,706 --> 00:42:04,006
何度だって生きる
I'll live again and again,

882
00:42:04,006 --> 00:42:05,206
お前や君の中
inside you and you.

883
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:07,706
瞼の裏や
Behind the eyelids,

884
00:42:07,706 --> 00:42:08,706
耳の中
and inside the ears.

885
00:42:09,206 --> 00:42:10,206
胸の奥に
Deep in the chest,

886
00:42:10,206 --> 00:42:12,006
居着いてるメロディ
the melody settled there.

887
00:42:12,006 --> 00:42:13,006
リズムに
Into the rhythm.

888
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,406
Yeah!

889
00:42:26,706 --> 00:42:37,206
Dan da dan dan...

890
00:42:53,206 --> 00:42:55,406
There's an answer out there somewhere,

891
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,506
When the Muses whisper truth or dare.

892
00:42:57,506 --> 00:42:59,406
The hands of fate play tug-of-war,

893
00:42:59,406 --> 00:43:01,206
But no one's keeping score.

894
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:03,406
Stay the course and be tenacious,

895
00:43:03,406 --> 00:43:05,306
'Cause the future is a game of chance.

896
00:43:05,306 --> 00:43:07,306
The chips are down but I'm all in,

897
00:43:07,306 --> 00:43:09,206
I play until I win.

898
00:43:09,206 --> 00:43:11,406
I'm not gonna give up now,

899
00:43:11,406 --> 00:43:13,506
The wheels of fortune circle back around.

900
00:43:13,506 --> 00:43:15,506
A new turn in the betting ring,

901
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:17,606
A maze of outcomes drawn in golden string.

902
00:43:17,606 --> 00:43:19,606
And through this tangled thread,

903
00:43:19,606 --> 00:43:21,506
I see what's up ahead!

904
00:43:21,506 --> 00:43:22,406
A wild chase,

905
00:43:22,406 --> 00:43:23,406
a frantic pace,

906
00:43:23,406 --> 00:43:25,706
I got to try my luck, I'm spinning fate!

907
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:31,406
Ah la da da da da da da...

908
00:43:31,406 --> 00:43:35,206
I'm always spinning fate.

909
00:43:36,206 --> 00:43:38,406
Whoa, yeah.

910
00:43:41,206 --> 00:43:42,706
Spin the roulette,

911
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:43,506
see where it falls,

912
00:43:43,506 --> 00:43:45,506
Testing the limits and betting it all.

913
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:46,606
Round and around,

914
00:43:46,606 --> 00:43:47,506
jumping into the circle,

915
00:43:47,506 --> 00:43:49,206
Over and over, a test of will.

916
00:43:49,206 --> 00:43:51,206
Oh, the game is never easy,

917
00:43:51,206 --> 00:43:53,206
and the outcome is a mystery.

918
00:43:53,206 --> 00:43:55,206
But these are fates worth betting on,

919
00:43:55,206 --> 00:43:57,206
their threads unbroken.

920
00:43:57,206 --> 00:43:59,206
Called to life

921
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:01,206
by flaxen strings.

922
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:02,706
Casting lots together

923
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,706
at the start of everything.

924
00:44:05,206 --> 00:44:07,206
I'm not gonna give up yet,

925
00:44:07,206 --> 00:44:09,206
I spin back 'round with every chance I get.

926
00:44:09,206 --> 00:44:11,206
The wheel turns and the die is cast,

927
00:44:11,206 --> 00:44:13,406
The time has come for fate to change at last.

928
00:44:13,406 --> 00:44:15,406
And if it's black or red,

929
00:44:15,406 --> 00:44:17,206
I'm moving up ahead!

930
00:44:17,206 --> 00:44:18,006
A perfect chance,

931
00:44:18,006 --> 00:44:19,006
a daring dance,

932
00:44:19,006 --> 00:44:21,706
I'll spin this thread of fate with my own hands!

933
00:44:24,206 --> 00:44:26,706
Ooh la la la...

934
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,706
I'm taking fate into my hands.

935
00:44:32,706 --> 00:44:35,206
Whoa, yeah.

936
00:44:37,206 --> 00:44:39,206
And through this tangled thread,

937
00:44:39,206 --> 00:44:41,206
I see what's up ahead!

938
00:44:41,206 --> 00:44:43,206
And through this tangled thread,

939
00:44:43,206 --> 00:44:45,206
I see what's up ahead!

940
00:44:51,206 --> 00:44:52,706
New song, new song, new song!

941
00:44:52,706 --> 00:44:53,506
New song!

942
00:44:53,506 --> 00:44:54,206
Yay!

943
00:44:54,206 --> 00:44:55,706
Yay!

944
00:44:55,706 --> 00:44:57,406
It's our first song as a trio, you guys.

945
00:44:57,406 --> 00:44:58,406
Oh, really?

946
00:44:58,406 --> 00:44:59,206
Oh, true!

947
00:44:59,206 --> 00:45:00,006
Thanks.

948
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:04,090
That was a good workout.

949
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:04,690
Yeah.

950
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:08,690
I guess that's because all the zoomers like it short nowadays, huh?

951
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,090
That's what everybody says.

952
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:10,990
Not me.

953
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:12,190
Certainly not.

954
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:15,690
But yeah, unfortunately this was also the last song for this live.

955
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,190
Ehhh?

956
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:17,790
But!

957
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:18,390
But!

958
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:22,690
The music video for our 5th anniversary song, Fortune Spinner...

959
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:27,690
...will premiere on the hololive English official YouTube channel right after this concert!

960
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:30,690
So make sure you stick around, okay?

961
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:31,690
Don't miss it.

962
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:32,590
Don't miss it!

963
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:34,390
Make sure you watch it a lot.

964
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:35,990
And loop it a lot.

965
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:36,690
Please.

966
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:37,690
Yes.

967
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:38,690
Very much.

968
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:39,690
そうですね。
That's right.

969
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:40,590
そうですね。
That is right.

970
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:42,690
We still have some celebrating to do though, right?

971
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:47,190
That's right, I think it's time, because it's the end, that we kind of celebrate ourselves here.

972
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:48,690
Five years!

973
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:49,990
Are we ready for that?

974
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:50,690
Yeah.

975
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,190
Yes, we're ready.

976
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:53,190
Okay, let's do it!

977
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:54,690
Let's do it!

978
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,190
Oh!

979
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:59,190
What is that cake over there? That is not mine.

980
00:45:59,290 --> 00:45:59,790
Hey!

981
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:00,690
Oh.

982
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:03,190
Wait wait wait wait wait!

983
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:05,190
Come on! Come on!

984
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:06,690
Wait can we eat it?

985
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:08,690
Let's talk about how delicious it looks.

986
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:09,390
Yeah!

987
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:10,690
No no I can't see it.

988
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:11,990
It's big too.

989
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,690
It's almost bigger than Ina.

990
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:14,390
Oh yeah.

991
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,690
Hey stop stop stop not now not now!

992
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,690
Don't pick off the strawberries!

993
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:19,690
Hold your horses!

994
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,190
Let's eat it later and celebrate.

995
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:22,190
Later, later.

996
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,690
And look, the trophies!

997
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:24,390
Yeah!

998
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,190
That's true.

999
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,690
Wait do we actually get trophies?

1000
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:28,190
Yeah, and awards show, right?

1001
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,690
Is that some of this?

1002
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,190
They were listening. Thank you.

1003
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:33,690
They followed our shopping list accordingly.

1004
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:34,190
Okay.

1005
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,190
Five years, we deserve an award.

1006
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:36,690
Yeah.

1007
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:41,690
We had so many meaningful accomplishments, so let's see what they all are, okay?

1008
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:42,190
Okay.

1009
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:44,190
Look at it be!

1010
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:45,690
Should I start?

1011
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:46,690
I'll take mine.

1012
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:47,690
Achoo!

1013
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:48,690
Oh bless you.

1014
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:49,690
Sorry.

1015
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:50,690
I'm not trying to disrupt your award.

1016
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:52,690
Cha cha cha cha!

1017
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,190
What did you get? What did you get?

1018
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:58,190
はい！ Er...
Yes! Er...

1019
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:00,190
My award is...

1020
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:04,690
Uh let's see... uh... I think it says...

1021
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,690
Most... Cooked... Cooked the Most?

1022
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:08,690
She's cooking.

1023
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:10,190
In HoloEN.

1024
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:11,690
Let her cook.

1025
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:12,690
Let her cook.

1026
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:13,690
Let her cook.

1027
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:14,690
Let her keep doing it.

1028
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,190
She has been cooking a lot. She has a lot of meals.

1029
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:18,690
Yes, thank you.

1030
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:22,190
I think that's what that's about. Mostly it's about, uh, you know...

1031
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,190
...me living a healthy lifestyle...

1032
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,690
...and then cooking many meals uh at home.

1033
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:29,190
I wish I could cook for you girls someday.

1034
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,190
Someday.

1035
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:33,190
I hope you guys enjoyed my performances today.

1036
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,190
I am so proud to like...

1037
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,190
...stand here with my genmates...

1038
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,690
...even on this day after so many years.

1039
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,190
Um, I will continue to work hard, of course.

1040
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,190
So that I can maybe gather even more awards.

1041
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:47,190
Um, I will put this on my shelf at home...

1042
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:50,690
...where my cats will also probably put a lot of fur on it.

1043
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:51,690
Oh yeah.

1044
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:52,190
Yum yum.

1045
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:53,190
Or knock it down.

1046
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:53,690
Meow meow.

1047
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:54,190
No no!

1048
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:55,690
They like to do that.

1049
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:56,690
Is it out of real glass?

1050
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,190
I gotta be a little bit careful but...

1051
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:58,690
Careful.

1052
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:02,190
Thank you guys so much! I love you! Mwah mwah mwah mwah!

1053
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,190
It's been an honor so far, so let's do our best together.

1054
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:08,690
Thank you for this award!

1055
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:09,690
Congrats!

1056
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:10,690
Who's the next one?

1057
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:11,690
Who is next?

1058
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:13,690
Is it... Ninomae Ina'nis?

1059
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:14,190
Me?

1060
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,690
Oh, could my award be, let's see...

1061
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:17,690
Most violent.

1062
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:18,690
What? Violent?

1063
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:19,190
No.

1064
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:19,990
100%.

1065
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:21,690
You do it to yourself.

1066
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:23,690
Alright. My award... is...

1067
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:24,190
Oh!

1068
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:27,690
Oh! Oh yes. I already guessed.

1069
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:30,190
It is... Most Time Spent on the Floor.

1070
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:31,690
That I believe.

1071
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,190
Thank you thank you thank you.

1072
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:38,190
I know you guys probably think I would never get this award, but you know...

1073
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,690
I worked so hard this year to stay on the floor.

1074
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:42,990
Very unprecedented.

1075
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,190
And uh yeah, not only did I stay on the floor...

1076
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:49,690
I, you know, really did my best to uh practice dancing and singing this year...

1077
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:51,690
...to perform well with you guys.

1078
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:53,690
And I hope that you guys see that as well.

1079
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:56,190
Thank you so much for all your support.

1080
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:58,690
I'll continue to do my best with these girls.

1081
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:59,690
Yay!

1082
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:01,190
Let's keep doing it!

1083
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:02,690
And last but not least.

1084
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:04,190
Mori Calliope.

1085
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:05,690
Oh what could it be?

1086
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:08,690
Our sneezer?

1087
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:09,690
Look at this.

1088
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:10,690
Don't sneeze today.

1089
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,690
Most sneezes in the Myth 5th anniversary showcase.

1090
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:13,690
Most blessed.

1091
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:15,690
Well, actually my trophy is for... じゃじゃーん！
Well, actually my trophy is for... Ta-da!

1092
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:17,690
Best Worst Luck.

1093
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:20,690
Especially in games where there are microtransactions.

1094
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:22,690
Ehhh? That's not so pop!

1095
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,190
Yeah, I mean I've seen it happen in real life.

1096
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:28,190
But the dedication, the determination to pull a signed card...

1097
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:29,690
I'm not gonna give up yet.

1098
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,190
Real quick, I'm gonna be very sappy.

1099
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:33,190
Well okay. Go ahead.

1100
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:35,690
I really like that line. 'I'm not gonna...'

1101
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:07,147
I'd like to think that we're not gonna give up yet,

1102
00:50:07,147 --> 00:50:10,347
because there's still so much that I wanna do...

1103
00:50:10,347 --> 00:50:11,947
uh, the three of us together.

1104
00:50:11,947 --> 00:50:12,447
Together.

1105
00:50:12,447 --> 00:50:13,447
You know, um...

1106
00:50:13,447 --> 00:50:17,047
and I didn't think that I would be here five years from the start...

1107
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,747
...with you guys.

1108
00:50:18,747 --> 00:50:19,347
Same.

1109
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:20,147
Yeah.

1110
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:22,547
I really thought I'd be out of here.

1111
00:50:22,547 --> 00:50:23,247
Same.

1112
00:50:23,247 --> 00:50:27,647
But now, I can't... I can't see a future where I'm not here with you guys.

1113
00:50:27,647 --> 00:50:28,347
Awww.

1114
00:50:27,847 --> 00:50:29,447
That's so romantic!

1115
00:50:29,647 --> 00:50:31,147
So... shut up.

1116
00:50:31,147 --> 00:50:32,147
Okay.

1117
00:50:32,147 --> 00:50:35,147
So because of that, I'm not gonna give up yet.

1118
00:50:35,147 --> 00:50:37,647
I don't want to give up yet.

1119
00:50:37,647 --> 00:50:39,347
So let's do our best together.

1120
00:50:40,047 --> 00:50:42,347
Oh yeah, the wrapping up jingle is playing.

1121
00:50:42,347 --> 00:50:45,047
I'm just gonna start talking about nothing because that annoys me...

1122
00:50:45,047 --> 00:50:46,647
...when they play the jingle to tell me to stop.

1123
00:50:46,647 --> 00:50:49,447
This morning I ate a bagel and it had cream cheese on it.

1124
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:51,847
It was delicious, but it went over my calories.

1125
00:50:51,847 --> 00:50:53,347
I'm in big trouble with my trainer.

1126
00:50:53,147 --> 00:50:54,647
Okay, wrap it up! Wrap it up!

1127
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,547
Anyway!

1128
00:50:55,547 --> 00:50:56,747
Five years! Five years!

1129
00:50:56,747 --> 00:50:57,847
You can't get rid of me!

1130
00:50:57,847 --> 00:50:58,747
Alright.

1131
00:50:58,747 --> 00:51:01,547
You can't get rid of any of us, hopefully!

1132
00:51:01,547 --> 00:51:02,347
Hopefully.

1133
00:51:02,047 --> 00:51:02,647
Hehehe.

1134
00:51:02,647 --> 00:51:05,347
Well everybody, all good things come to an end, unfortunately.

1135
00:51:05,347 --> 00:51:09,847
But thank you so much to the hololive English community for supporting us continuously for five years.

1136
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:13,547
Thank you to the girlies today and all the staff-san that supported us also...

1137
00:51:13,547 --> 00:51:16,447
...for this celebration, who gave us the trophies!

1138
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:17,347
Yeah!

1139
00:51:17,347 --> 00:51:19,647
Once again, congratulations to us!

1140
00:51:19,647 --> 00:51:20,647
To us!

1141
00:51:20,647 --> 00:51:22,047
Yay!

1142
00:51:22,047 --> 00:51:22,747
Woo-hoo!

1143
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:23,447
Thank you!

1144
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:24,347
Thank you!

1145
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:25,347
Thanks guys!

1146
00:51:25,347 --> 00:51:26,747
Bye bye!

1147
00:51:26,747 --> 00:51:28,347
Peace!

1148
00:51:29,447 --> 00:51:31,247
We forgot our merch!

1149
00:51:31,247 --> 00:51:32,547
We forgot our merch!

1150
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,647
Merch! Please!

1151
00:51:33,647 --> 00:51:35,447
Merch time!

1152
00:51:35,447 --> 00:51:37,647
The merchandise!

1153
00:51:41,247 --> 00:51:43,147
Next is the merchandise announcement!

1154
00:51:43,147 --> 00:51:47,247
We have hololive English -Myth- 5th Anniversary Celebration merch being released!

1155
00:51:50,647 --> 00:51:52,647
Let's look at the details. Check it out!

1156
00:51:52,947 --> 00:51:55,947
First up, we've got the Mirror Acrylic Panel.

1157
00:51:55,947 --> 00:52:00,847
It's designed so that the surroundings and background of the illustration have a metallic mirrored vibe.

1158
00:52:00,847 --> 00:52:02,047
Ooh, so cool!

1159
00:52:02,047 --> 00:52:04,447
I absolutely love this illustration.

1160
00:52:04,447 --> 00:52:05,847
Hope you guys do too.

1161
00:52:06,247 --> 00:52:10,447
Next up, we have... the Collection Cards!

1162
00:52:10,447 --> 00:52:12,947
These cards feature a shiny metallic finish...

1163
00:52:12,947 --> 00:52:15,747
...and you can choose from three different designs.

1164
00:52:15,747 --> 00:52:18,447
Also, the backside is matching for us all.

1165
00:52:18,447 --> 00:52:22,247
Make sure to get the one from your oshi, for sure!

1166
00:52:24,947 --> 00:52:27,647
Next up, we have the Coin Medals!

1167
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:31,147
Our shiny 5th Anniversary commemorative coin medals.

1168
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:33,447
There's one design for each member.

1169
00:52:33,447 --> 00:52:36,047
And the back sides also have a common design.

1170
00:52:36,047 --> 00:52:41,547
They come in an antique gold-plated finish inside the original packaging.

1171
00:52:41,547 --> 00:52:44,147
Ooh, so shiny!

1172
00:52:45,247 --> 00:52:47,547
Oh man, everything looks so good!

1173
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:51,747
But, I'm especially interested in what we have to show you guys next.

1174
00:52:51,747 --> 00:52:54,947
Next up, we have the Anniversary Hats!

1175
00:52:54,947 --> 00:52:58,447
So first up, Anniversary Hat - Mori Calliope.

1176
00:52:58,447 --> 00:53:00,847
This one uses a soft, fluffy fabric.

1177
00:53:00,847 --> 00:53:02,747
The Death-sensei part is removable...

1178
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:04,647
...so you can also rock it without him.

1179
00:53:04,647 --> 00:53:07,647
Make sure that you check it out. It's super stylish.

1180
00:53:07,647 --> 00:53:09,347
I love the shape so much.

1181
00:53:09,347 --> 00:53:12,947
And, uh, all of my member Deadbeats voted on it together.

1182
00:53:12,947 --> 00:53:14,847
So hope that you guys will enjoy.

1183
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:20,347
Next up we have mine! The Anniversary Hat from Takanashi Kiara.

1184
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:22,047
Looks like this!

1185
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,947
Decorative parts are removable.

1186
00:53:23,947 --> 00:53:26,547
It can be worn reversibly, inside out...

1187
00:53:26,547 --> 00:53:29,147
...so you'll have a different color then.

1188
00:53:29,147 --> 00:53:31,947
And it's a bucket hat style design...

1189
00:53:31,947 --> 00:53:34,047
...which we didn't have before for me.

1190
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:36,647
Very fashionable, I must say.

1191
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:39,347
Last but not least, we have my hat!

1192
00:53:39,347 --> 00:53:42,047
The Anniversary Hat - Ninomae Ina'nis.

1193
00:53:42,047 --> 00:53:45,547
The ribbon part is removable and the patches are super cute too.

1194
00:53:45,547 --> 00:53:48,447
You can wear it to become a Takodachi.

1195
00:53:48,447 --> 00:53:49,447
Yes.

1196
00:53:49,447 --> 00:53:53,147
And yeah, you can mix and match with or without the ribbon for different looks.

1197
00:53:53,547 --> 00:53:55,947
So, everybody, be sure to check our merch out!

1198
00:53:55,947 --> 00:54:00,847
