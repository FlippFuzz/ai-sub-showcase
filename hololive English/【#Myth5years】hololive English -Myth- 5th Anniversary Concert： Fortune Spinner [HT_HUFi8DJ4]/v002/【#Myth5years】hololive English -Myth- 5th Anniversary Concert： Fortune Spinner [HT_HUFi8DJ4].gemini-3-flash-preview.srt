2
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,800
Okay, we've reached the destination.

3
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,800
Right on time.

4
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,000
Is everyone ready?

5
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,400
You bet. Let's go.

6
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Alright then!

7
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,800
Ready... set... Jump!

8
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,500
Havin' a blast!

9
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,500
We're ready to greet the world

10
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,500
We're voyaging forward with courage to run

11
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,200
toward a brand new start

12
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Let's go live,

13
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,500
bridging the distance across the sea

14
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,400
Endlessly, cheerfully

15
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,800
meeting heart to heart!

16
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,000
Look up at the horizon together as one

17
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,000
A star is on the rise and it's only begun

18
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,000
The pivotal moment we're clamoring for

19
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,000
An infinite future's at our door

20
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,800
Yeah!

21
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,500
It's a timeless story with a new feel

22
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,400
Not just allegory, it's real

23
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,100
Wake up, big dreams about to come true

24
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,000
That means it's time to break through

25
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,800
Never knew we could make it so far, but we're

26
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,500
striving, thriving, here we are

27
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,100
Achieving the impossible

28
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
We're virtually unstoppable

29
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,000
We can't sit still, we just keep moving

30
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,500
Now everybody sing!

31
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,800
We're making our way to the new dimension

32
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,100
We'll reinvent the world that we live in

33
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,400
We'll create every day with new intentions

34
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Break conventions, run right through!

35
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Smashing barriers left and right

36
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,700
Strong as we ever were, scaling heights

37
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,700
So get together, let's reunite

38
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,000
Reach up, reach out, the future's bright!

39
00:05:04,148 --> 00:05:05,448
We're ready to seize the day

40
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:07,448
Traversing the pathways

41
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:09,548
Discovering highways to everywhere

42
00:05:10,248 --> 00:05:11,348
Step by step (Yeah!)

43
00:05:11,448 --> 00:05:14,348
Gathering stories that we can share!

44
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,848
Get ready to lead the way

45
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:19,448
With each generation, a shining sensation,

46
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:20,948
A dream unfurls

47
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:22,548
Let's make friends (Yeah!)

48
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:25,548
Making a moment of history

49
00:05:25,648 --> 00:05:28,948
Joyfully, follow me

50
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:32,448
We'll connect the world!

51
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:38,248
They'll hear our song ringing out over hills and oceans

52
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:43,948
Our legend grows and continues!

53
00:05:44,748 --> 00:05:49,848
We'll carry on starting now, setting hearts in motion

54
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:54,948
Connecting all of the world!

55
00:06:02,548 --> 00:06:05,548
We're making our way to the next dimension

56
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:08,648
We're living out the dreams we believe in

57
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:11,948
Excitement beyond our comprehension

58
00:06:12,048 --> 00:06:14,748
There's no question we'll break through!

59
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:18,148
Don't retreat! We'll keep aspiring to excel

60
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:21,648
That's our Myth! It's awe-inspiring going well

61
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,448
Represent! So light the fire and let's rebel

62
00:06:24,548 --> 00:06:27,948
The future's brighter, we can tell!

63
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:34,948
We're ready to...

64
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:43,748
We're ready to change the world!

65
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:57,648
Medley, medley, medley, medley, medley!

66
00:06:58,548 --> 00:06:59,248
What are you doing?

67
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:03,548
Oh you too? Both of you guys are acting a little strange.

68
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:05,048
We're doing crazy poses!

69
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:06,348
Why are they being so silly?

70
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:07,548
We got a show to do!

71
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:09,148
You guys have a show to do!

72
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:12,448
Ina, come on, come on!

73
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:13,648
頑張れ！
Go for it!

74
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:15,548
I know the floor is nice, but...

75
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:16,848
It is really nice!

76
00:07:17,948 --> 00:07:18,548
It's smooth!

77
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:22,548
Minna-san, thank you for coming to the show today to celebrate Myth's...
Everyone, thank you for coming to the show today to celebrate Myth's...

78
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:24,648
...you guessed it, fifth anniversary!

79
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:30,248
That was the medley, a nice throwback. We've made so many songs together.

80
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:32,448
Nostalgic!

81
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:35,848
Putting it all together like that is like really emotional.

82
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:41,548
And it's not just like our fifth anniversary, it's also hololive English as a whole, five years!

83
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:45,048
We're so old!

84
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:45,848
Senior!

85
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:47,348
We're all yippee!

86
00:07:49,148 --> 00:07:52,548
We're oldies, we also achieved so much in the last five years, you know?

87
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:55,348
We had three EN concerts.

88
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:56,548
My voice cracked, sorry about that!

89
00:07:57,748 --> 00:08:00,048
And we had a lot of friends join us over the years.

90
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:05,248
And this, you know, in the end I'm just really happy to be performing with you guys. It's so much fun!

91
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:10,548
We can't get too emotional just yet, though, because we have a show to do!

92
00:08:13,648 --> 00:08:15,548
Anyways, anyways, anyways, there's a hashtag right here, right here!

93
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:22,548
Take lots of pictures, screenshots and post them on social media. #Myth5years!

94
00:08:23,648 --> 00:08:24,748
Make us trend!

95
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:29,048
If you want, you don't have to if you don't want to.

96
00:08:30,148 --> 00:08:31,548
If you don't do it we'll be sad. We'll be angry.

97
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:33,248
We'll get you!

98
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,548
Also, besides that, everybody, this is important!

99
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:38,848
I'm just checking...

100
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:41,248
...making sure you guys are all here legally.

101
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:45,348
Did you guys all receive a ticket-sama? Hmm?
Did you guys all receive a ticket? Hmm?

102
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:50,048
Ah, it's me! It's me! That's me!

103
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:51,348
We look so cool!

104
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:56,548
Yeah, I think I gave you mine at the bar. It was kind of spicy, remember?

105
00:08:57,448 --> 00:09:00,548
I... I accosted you on the street, if you remember correctly.

106
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:03,248
Oh! Oh! That's what you're up to.

107
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:08,548
I... I... I might have trespassed.

108
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:13,448
Ina wouldn't do such a thing!

109
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:22,448
Well... my Ninomae Ina'nis...

110
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:27,548
Nothing! I did nothing illegal!

111
00:09:27,648 --> 00:09:30,548
Fine, don't tell me, keep your secrets. It's fine. I'm used to it in five years.

112
00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:34,248
Now that we know that everybody's here with their tickets and they're allowed to be here...

113
00:09:34,348 --> 00:09:38,248
...we'll be singing a lot on this stage today in different combinations and different fun songs and so on.

114
00:09:46,648 --> 00:09:47,548
Floor!

115
00:09:47,648 --> 00:09:48,848
Okay! Beautiful stage!

116
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:51,848
お洒落！
Stylish!

117
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:52,648
Fancy!

118
00:09:52,748 --> 00:09:53,648
There's a chair! Test it out, test it out!

119
00:09:53,748 --> 00:09:54,648
How much does that cost?

120
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:55,848
Couch! Can I lie on it?

121
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:00,048
Oh my god! The chandelier!

122
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:01,953
I really like that one.

123
00:10:01,953 --> 00:10:03,073
Are we stealing that?

124
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:04,353
Is that a heart?

125
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,483
What's the heart for?

126
00:10:05,573 --> 00:10:06,683
Looks expensive.

127
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:07,603
It does.

128
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,503
Wait, did it just change color?

129
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:10,673
It just gained some color.

130
00:10:10,673 --> 00:10:11,953
Oh, why, I wonder?

131
00:10:12,223 --> 00:10:14,623
Could it be that it's reacting to

132
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:17,123
everybody's reactions in the chat

133
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:19,523
and their feelings? It's changing color

134
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:20,623
according to that!

135
00:10:20,623 --> 00:10:21,923
Are you guys getting excited?

136
00:10:23,473 --> 00:10:25,973
So you guys have an important job to do now, right?

137
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:27,623
Yeah, it's just they're always doing something.

138
00:10:27,623 --> 00:10:29,123
You guys are always doing things.

139
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:31,023
It must be their power...

140
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:32,523
...and their energy!

141
00:10:32,523 --> 00:10:33,923
It's flowing through us.

142
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:34,723
Thank you.

143
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:37,423
Well, I look forward to seeing

144
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:39,323
how it develops from here out.

145
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:41,123
So, you know what you're gonna do, right?

146
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:42,623
You're gonna get out your keyboards,

147
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:44,323
and you're gonna type some things.

148
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:45,923
[Myth Typing Noises]

149
00:10:46,023 --> 00:10:47,523
Hackerman! Yeah.

150
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:49,523
Give us your energy!

151
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,923
Give it to us!

152
00:10:51,073 --> 00:10:52,923
Yeah, not like we're trying to

153
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:54,423
shake you down or anything.

154
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:56,223
I feel it! I'm shaking them down!

155
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:57,723
Oh, okay. All right,

156
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,323
we're choosing violence again today.

157
00:10:59,523 --> 00:11:00,923
Why are you so violent?

158
00:11:01,123 --> 00:11:02,923
It's supposed to be wholesome and...

159
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:05,523
...just really happy to be here.

160
00:11:05,723 --> 00:11:07,423
Five years later, she's done.

161
00:11:07,573 --> 00:11:08,923
Oh no, they know the real me now.

162
00:11:09,223 --> 00:11:10,323
Sorry, I'm sorry!

163
00:11:10,523 --> 00:11:11,923
Why am I always the one

164
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:13,323
that makes things awkward?

165
00:11:13,523 --> 00:11:14,823
It's all Ina's fault!

166
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,023
I apologize.

167
00:11:16,523 --> 00:11:18,623
Yeah, 'cause there's not a lot of time

168
00:11:18,623 --> 00:11:20,423
for yapping too much today, it seems.

169
00:11:20,623 --> 00:11:22,523
We're gonna dance our hearts out

170
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:24,523
and sing our hearts out for you guys.

171
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:27,123
And oh man, we've been doing

172
00:11:27,123 --> 00:11:28,523
a lot of that these days.

173
00:11:28,723 --> 00:11:31,623
I think everybody in Myth deserves a trophy.

174
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:33,323
A little reward.

175
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:34,623
A little reward.

176
00:11:34,773 --> 00:11:35,923
A treat, perhaps?

177
00:11:36,123 --> 00:11:37,023
Cookies!

178
00:11:37,173 --> 00:11:38,123
Cookies?

179
00:11:38,273 --> 00:11:39,623
Cookies are good too.

180
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:42,623
Maybe a cookie-shaped trophy?

181
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:45,423
Or a trophy made out of a cookie.

182
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:47,123
Or a trophy-shaped cookie.

183
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:48,123
Yes!

184
00:11:48,273 --> 00:11:49,123
Yes please.

185
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:50,523
You hear that management?

186
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:53,423
You better be having some rewards for us.

187
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:54,723
So demanding.

188
00:11:54,973 --> 00:11:56,323
Yeah, well, that's okay.

189
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:57,723
In any case,

190
00:11:57,873 --> 00:11:59,923
I know how we can kick this off.

191
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:01,323
Kick it off?

192
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:02,423
Yeah.

193
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:04,723
So, maybe it's like a little cheesy,

194
00:12:04,873 --> 00:12:07,523
but I thought maybe the three of us

195
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:09,723
could like jump in the air and go "Wheee!"

196
00:12:10,123 --> 00:12:12,523
Like "3, 2, 1, jump!" and then

197
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:15,423
the camera goes "Vrooom!" we like fly

198
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:18,323
into the air and go to the next song.

199
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:19,923
I get it, I get it.

200
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,023
I get you.

201
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,423
I've done it before.

202
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:23,923
Okay! Then let's do it.

203
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:26,623
No punching, no violent thoughts, Ina.

204
00:12:26,823 --> 00:12:29,123
Don't punch the camera. I know what you're thinking.

205
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,423
Just one uppercut?

206
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:31,623
Not one! Zero!

207
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:32,523
Nice.

208
00:12:32,773 --> 00:12:33,923
Okay, let's do it.

209
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:35,523
Here we go! On my count.

210
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:36,523
Ready?

211
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,423
Okay.

212
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:39,023
Next song start!

213
00:12:39,223 --> 00:12:42,623
3, 2, 1, JUMP!

00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:57,923
つまんないデイズ 散々だね
Boring days, they're terrible

217
00:12:57,923 --> 00:13:00,223
奇跡願ってるだけの人生
A life just wishing for miracles

218
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:04,323
Watch me do-to-do-to-do Hit you 研ぎ澄ましのマジック
Watch me do-to-do-to-do, hit you with refined magic

219
00:13:04,323 --> 00:13:08,623
One, two, three だってまだフリーダム The party ain't started
One, two, three, because it's still freedom, the party ain't started

220
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:12,423
ヘイタクシー ちょっと宇宙まで
Hey taxi, take me to space

221
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:16,923
夜空は音を立てて 夜を急かす魔法みたいだ
The night sky makes a sound, like magic hurrying the night along

222
00:13:20,223 --> 00:13:24,123
人生は一瞬にして 解ける魔法
Life is magic that unravels in an instant

223
00:13:24,523 --> 00:13:29,023
恐れなんかないわ かけてみて 魔法 今宵のストーリー
I've no fear, try casting it, magic, tonight's story

224
00:13:29,473 --> 00:13:31,823
邪魔な馬車飛び乗って Driving
Jump into that pesky carriage, driving

225
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:34,323
私を大変身 Make up
Give me a complete makeover, make up

226
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:38,323
我儘のマニマニ 煌めきに注意注意
As I please, beware, beware of the sparkle

227
00:13:38,473 --> 00:13:42,523
Shut up な街で Dancing サヨナラ Goodbye劣等感
Dancing in a "shut up" town, farewell, goodbye inferiority complex

228

白紙も正解も間違いも 愛せ本当の私の理想
Love the blank pages, the right answers, and the mistakes, my true ideal

237
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:18,523
なんだか世界は限界の気配がしてうだうだだ
Somehow the world feels like it's at its limit, just droning on

238
00:14:18,673 --> 00:14:22,523
安心じゃ心配 歩きましょう Jumpin' Jumpin' out
Security is worrying, let's walk, jumpin' jumpin' out

239
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:26,623
ギリギリばっか 正味ばっか 今は発散してしまおうか
Always at the limit, always just the net amount, shall we let it all out now?

240
00:14:30,673 --> 00:14:34,523
まだまだビビッとキミにダンシング 夜っ端じゃ物足りないわ
Still dancing to you with a spark, the start of the night isn't enough

241
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:38,523
ついに導き出したキミへのアンサー ハイになるまで踊ってよ

Let's get started.

250
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:21,072
Easy breezy down.

251
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:23,972
Hey 頭の中でのこのCremaは 私のPersonaに繋がる
Hey, the crema in my head connects to my persona

252
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:27,772
生まれたてのアイデアと情熱があるが 疑う事もなく冴えある者が群がる
With freshly born ideas and passion, those who are sure to shine flock together

253
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:29,972
What about you 誰だ？狂妄膨らます
What about you? Stir up those delusions

254
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:34,072
ひと時たまらない分かちきろの先に待つ 結末は麒麟児大器晩成玉だがる
The end that awaits beyond the fleeting, undeniable moments is the late bloomer’s magnum opus

255
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:36,072
選ぶのは自分景気づけ先に景気飲め
A segment of one's peak, a cake that comes before a break

256
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:38,972
怒涛に如く数多貸して 研いだ言の葉ここで息高し
Accompanied by the sweet heights of nostalgia, that's where I'll live

257
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,072
Come on hurry どこまでも
Come on hurry, let's go together

258
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:43,072
今夜の事推しあつま
To the other side of tonight's fleeting dream

259
00:15:43,172 --> 00:15:45,072
Live it with no hesitation

260
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:47,372
時間を忘れ焦がれる炎の情
Forgetting time, the roar of the fire

261
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:49,072
Keep it back coming up next level

262
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:51,372
The future's only colored by the cleverest of rebels

263
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:53,372
飽和せし情を糧に正気
Feeding off of saturated passion, stay sane

264
00:15:53,472 --> 00:15:55,372
狂気乱舞種が芽出し入り乱れ賞鼓
A wild dance of madness, the seed sprouts and the prize is heralded

265
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:57,272
乱れ咲い等謳歌ビルホー
Enjoy the blooming, chaotic days to the fullest

266
00:15:57,672 --> 00:15:58,372
熱狂！
NEKKYOU!

267
00:15:58,672 --> 00:16:01,872
Just a little madness, you could take the drive out of me

268
00:16:01,972 --> 00:16:02,572
熱狂！
NEKKYOU!

269
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:06,072

熱狂！
NEKKYOU!

271
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:10,372
Tearing up the canvas, won't be watching what you want me to be

272
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:11,072
熱狂！
NEKKYOU!

273
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:14,572
Can't fight this uprising outbreak of passion

274
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:17,372
Too rough, too loud, unburned, unrefined

275
00:16:18,572 --> 00:16:22,572
Find out that flood of noise is only in our minds

276
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:26,572
Right now, it's time, no doubt we're moving on

277
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:30,572
I'm drawing my ideal world at each and every dawn

278
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:32,472
狂い出した瞬間
The moment things went crazy

279
00:16:32,572 --> 00:16:34,572
感じきれば悩みも昇華
If you notice, your worries will be sublimated

280
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:38,872
Breaking all expectations, time to forget and burn with the passion

281
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:40,572
反芻するならし
No need for rumination

282
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:42,372
罪過の眼差し
The gaze of guilt

283
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:44,872
解き放とう情熱を今
Release the passion right now

284
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:47,372
Never hitting the brakes to prove I got what it takes

285
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:49,072
To manifest a world you've never discerned as real or fake, so come on

286
00:16:49,172 --> 00:16:49,872
熱狂！
NEKKYOU!

287
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:53,372
Just a little madness, you could take the drive out of me

288
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:54,072
熱狂！
NEKKYOU!

289
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:57,572
Can't hide it's a new generation creation

熱狂！
NEKKYOU!

291
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:01,872
Tearing up the canvas, won't be watching what you want me to be

292
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:02,572
熱狂！
NEKKYOU!

293
00:17:02,872 --> 00:17:06,072
Can't fight this uprising outbreak of passion

294
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:08,572
ああ 人様よこれっぽっちも
Ah, people don't even have a bit of it

295
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:11,872
自分の背中預けるような夢があればそれでいい
As long as you have a dream that you can entrust your back to, it's fine

296
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:13,872
誰れに笑われようよりもひたすらにあがき
Keep struggling no matter who laughs at you

297
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:16,272
やまない雨はないと信じ今に様変わる
Believing that there's no rain that won't stop, everything will change now

298
00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:18,372
Words are gifted, prolific, you bet to be specific

299
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:20,572
Brushstrokes blowing smoke blink and you can miss it

300
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,572
These words elicit visions of a future so exquisite

301
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:25,072
Some masterpiece you never seen wait a few commit it

302
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:27,372
知らない事があれば研究 出来ない事があれば練習
If there's something you don't know, research it. If there's something you can't do, practice it.

303
00:17:27,472 --> 00:17:29,372
姿勢を前のめり 我を熱中
Lean forward and get absorbed in yourself

304
00:17:29,472 --> 00:17:32,472
成功の真反対にある失敗が 一番の近道だ You can do it 最高峰は道だ
The failures on the opposite side of success are the shortest path. You can do it, the peak is the path.

305
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:34,572
Stars align and all design I'm already on my way

306
00:17:34,872 --> 00:17:38,872
ほとばしる情熱 瑞々が震える鼓動の銃弾まで
Gushing passion, until the moist pulse of the bullets

307
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:43,072
Focus finding all this blind risk I'm already on my way

308
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:47,372
This is some vivid and striking my NEKKYOU!

309
00:17:47,472 --> 00:17:48,072
熱狂！
NEKKYOU!

310
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:52,372
熱狂！

00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,572
This is some vivid and striking my NEKKYOU!

314
00:18:04,672 --> 00:18:05,372
熱狂！
NEKKYOU!

315
00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:39,772
誤解すんなよ こんな滑稽な
Don't misunderstand, it's laughable

316
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:42,072
サッと過ぎ去る毎日（エブリデイ）
How time flashes by every day

317
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:44,572
Another prisoner of fate no one could fake out

318
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:47,072
Stay awake now, you know you wanna fire away

319
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:49,572
Now there's no question where the fault lies

320
00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:52,072
These days I struggle just to empathize

321
00:18:52,472 --> 00:18:56,072
もう戻らないって分かっているんだろう
There's no going back, and you know that

322
00:18:57,172 --> 00:18:59,072
Cast a blessing on my cursed role

323
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,072
And feed this bleeding egotistical soul

324
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:04,572
Before you know it, it's the moment you've lost all control

325
00:19:05,172 --> 00:19:07,772
遠き日の夢を見るたび
Every time I dream of days gone by

326
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:12,872
生まれた意味を考えてしまうの
I wonder why I came to be

327
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:17,372
嗚呼 美しい 青い日々だな
Ah, such beautiful, youthful days

328
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:22,072
この目に焼き付けておこうかな
I should burn their images into my mind

329
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:25,572
もう少し強くならないとな
But I'd have to be a little stronger first

330
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:37,072
身分不相応の嫉妬に塗れた
Dripping in jealousy that's a bit too daring

331
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:39,272
ちょっと足りないエクスタシー
An ecstasy that's just a little bit lacking

332
00:19:39,572 --> 00:19:43,572
誤解も解けないまま私 人を傷つけて
I hurt somebody without ever opening my eyes

333
00:19:44,272 --> 00:19:46,072
一粒の才すらないわ
But there's no talent here, it's clear to see

334
00:19:46,472 --> 00:19:48,572
転がり落ちたジロゴロサイ
The rigged dice falls and rolls

335
00:19:48,872 --> 00:19:52,072
貴方の愛に気付けないまま
Before I ever notice your love and affection

336
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:54,672
Cast a blessing on my cursed heart

337
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:57,372
Why keep me breathing while it's falling apart?

338
00:19:57,672 --> 00:19:59,872
どうか神様 教えてくれますか
Pray tell me, God

339
00:20:00,128 --> 00:20:01,328
...すか
...?

340
00:20:01,428 --> 00:20:04,628
言葉少なに貴方に捧ぐ
I give to you silently

341
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:10,128
今に消えてしまいそうなこの命を
My life that's about to burn out

342
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:14,628
鳴呼 愛おしいセピア色した
Ah, and these sepia-toned sights

343
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:19,128
何より大事なこの景色を
they're most precious of all

344
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:21,928
もう少し見ていたいよな
I wish I could see them a bit more...

345
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:24,128
I'm always gonna be my own worst enemy

346
00:20:24,128 --> 00:20:26,628
Everything I ever wanted was in front of me

347
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:28,628
The angels on my shoulder still cannot agree

348
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,628
If I was somebody else, could I get everything?

349
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:32,928
I'm always gonna be my own worst enemy

350
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:35,128
Everything I ever wanted was in front of me

351
00:20:35,628 --> 00:20:37,628
The devils on my shoulder never let me be

352
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:39,628
Obsessing over tomorrows that I'll never see

353
00:20:40,128 --> 00:20:41,628
Somebody save me

354
00:20:41,628 --> 00:20:44,928
My world is caving in cuz I thought I deserved it all for free, yeah yeah

355
00:20:45,128 --> 00:20:48,428
遠き日の夢を見るたび
Every time I dream of days gone by

356
00:20:48,428 --> 00:20:53,128
生まれた意味を考えてしまうの
I wonder why I came to be

357
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:57,628
鳴呼 美しい蒼い日々だな
Ah, such beautiful, youthful days

358
00:20:57,628 --> 00:21:02,128
この目に焼き付けておこうかな
I should burn their images into my mind

359
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,628
もう少し強くなりたいとな
But I'd have to be a little stronger first

360
00:21:41,628 --> 00:21:46,928

A sunny spell, now dance and dance, play in love's yearning, clap your hands like cherry blossoms

Look at that, throw in the basket too, I really want to go and see for myself

365
00:22:16,328 --> 00:22:21,128
人生より道まわり道
Life is a detour, a roundabout way

366
00:22:21,428 --> 00:22:26,628
行きたいように生きられや
Live as you wish to live

Oh, hi! Hey.

456
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,510
You guys look a little tired.

457
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,810
I thought we were posing for the Myth album cover,

458
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,810
which is not coming out, by the way.

459
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,510
Misunderstanding! Misunderstanding.

460
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,010
Well, we have a mixtape, though.

461
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,710
Someday, someday.

462
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,010
Did you guys enjoy the song so far?

463
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,310
What did you think?

464
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,910
Yeah, pretty fun.

465
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

466
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,910

Yeah, you guys's voices... "you guys's"?

470
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,410
Your voices fit really, really well with that.

471
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,510
Oh, thank you.

472
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,410
Yeah, it's a really cute song.

473
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,010
Yeah. I... me and Ina were like,

474
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,110
"What song should we do together?"

475
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,810
And I was like, "Ha! I wonder if Ina

476
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,910
would let me do a Monogatari song?"

477
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,210
I was like, "Monogatari please!"

478
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,510
And she's like, "Yeah! Sure!"

479
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,010
You're talking to Ninomae Ina'nis, you know!

480
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,510
Of course I'm gonna say yes!

481
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,210
But we all like Monogatari.

482
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,210
We do, yeah! We all could have done it too, huh?

483
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,710
Sure, yeah, I would have done it.

484
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,010
We could have had her doing the...

485
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,910
(Sings bits of song)

486
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,010
Now I wanna see that!

487
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,210
I can do it now. I can do it now.

488
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,710
We should have done it as three people because it was cute!

489
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,910
But I'm gonna be as cute as I can.

490
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,010
That was everybody's solos, though.

491
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,110
Yeah. Oh yeah.

492
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,310
Except mine, that was amazing.

493
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,710
You guys know I could rap that fast?

494
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,410
Oh my god, I was so surprised!

495
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,710
Kind of crazy. Impressive.

496
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,410
Yeah, mama!

497
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,710
かっこいい、カリ！
You're so cool, Calli!

498
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,510
I did my best. It was like, enough,

499
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,210
enough of this. Oh, you know, she did it.

500
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,210
And then plus the dancing was pretty cool too.

501
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,010
Oh yeah!

502
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,410
頑張った！ Good job!
You did your best! Good job!

503
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,010
And Ina too, very impressive!

504
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,210
Oh my goodness, I really challenged myself.

505
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,210
The dancing has leveled up so much.

506
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,210
Yeah!

507
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,510
ありがとう！
Thank you!

508
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,210
Cute, beautiful.

509
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,710
Yeah, demure.

510
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,366
It was a lot of fun, it was difficult,
of course my heart rate shot through the roof.

511
00:30:04,432 --> 00:30:05,266
But we did it.

512
00:30:05,266 --> 00:30:06,066
We did it.

513
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:08,966
And then me and Ina did some air guitar.

514
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,166
Yeah.

515
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:14,466
My original song, Sepia, was a...
very close song to my heart.

516
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:16,166
And Ina played guitar by the way.

517
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:18,466
Yeah, I loved the purple guitar.

518
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:20,166
Yeah, so cool.

519
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:21,966
But what's still missing now?

520
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:26,666
Oh, there are a couple songs missing, aren't there?
Like WAWA's song, my song...

521
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:28,166
A lot of unit songs...

522
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,666
And mine and Calli's combination song...

523
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:36,666
I wonder why...
I wonder, I wonder.

524
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:41,966
I will just say that the song for me and Calli
was also chosen, kind of suggested by me.

525
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,666
Thank you for... thank you for being okay with it.

526
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:50,666
It's a nice song. I don't want to spoil anything,
but it was pretty good.

527
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:56,666
And my solo will be...
eh... epic and hyped! So look forward to it.

528
00:30:56,666 --> 00:31:00,666
What's the music? Can you give a hint?
I know it's about to happen pretty soon here, but...

529
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:03,166
No! No! No hints!

530
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,666
Alright, alright.

531
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:06,666
Why? I'm a toddler, why?

532
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:13,166
Yes, we still have a lot of our show left over,
so don't tune out. There's lots more! Stay with us!

533
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:14,166
Stay right here.

534
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,666
Don't move.

535
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:19,666
Wait and continue to watch until the end.
And use the hashtag! Don't forget that.

536
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:21,166
Okay, hashtag.

537
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:24,666
Are we ready to move on? Move on?
Okay.

538
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:26,166
What should we do?

539
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:28,166
No, what should we do?
We should play with the camera.

540
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,166
What do you want to do, Ina?
What do you want to do the most?

541
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:31,666
I know what to do...

542
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:32,366
Oh?

543
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:33,966
What are you going to do?

544
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:38,366
Not something violent, right?

545
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:43,666
Oh! She's going to do something violent!
She's doing something violent!

546
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,166
Hee-yah!

547
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:53,166
Confessions of a Rotten Girl

548
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:54,666
Dear God, I've come to repent my sins.

549
00:31:55,966 --> 00:31:58,666
Let your blood wash me clean, for I'm...

550
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,166
I'm...

551
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:02,166
I'm...

552
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:04,666
I'm a rotten girl!

553
00:32:05,766 --> 00:32:08,666
I swore I'd never sin again

554
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:11,666
But my patience's running thin

555
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,666
Temptation's flowing through my veins

556
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,466
And bounded by the shackles of shame

557
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,666
I promised I'd indulge no more

558
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:22,666
But my heart I can't ignore

559
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,966
In my dreams they're turning up the heat

560
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:28,666
I'm a dirty rotten girl

561
00:32:29,766 --> 00:32:32,166
I'm locked underneath the bleachers

562
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,666
Just watch, look beyond the smoke and mirrors

563
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:37,166
Hearts struck, shun the unbeliever

564
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:40,166
Our reparation would never be complete

565
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:43,166
Red hot tension in each whisper

566
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:46,166
Snapshot, quiet moans and muffled whimpers

567
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:49,166
Come on, can't you feel the fever

568
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,666
Rising up, rising up to the sky

569
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:54,166
And as the realm of toxic fear slips beneath my skin

570
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:57,166
The Lord sayeth, 'Help my child, don't give in to sin'

571
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:00,166
It's driving me crazy, the urge to forsake

572
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:03,166
The incense of shifts within this wicked play

573
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:06,666
I swore I'd never sin again

574
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:09,666
But my patience's running thin

575
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:12,166
Student Council breathing down my neck

576
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,666
I wonder if they're hiding from me

577
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:17,666
Forbidden fruit before my eyes

578
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:20,666
And a taste that solidifies

579
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,666
My regret, regretting history

580
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:26,666
I'm a doubtful rotten girl

581
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:30,166
Someone please tell me what to do

582
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,666
Because honestly, I just can't stop

583
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:35,166
I've been trying so hard and I can't stop

584
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:36,666
What would God think?

585
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:41,166
And I, I know I'm supposed to be a good girl but

586
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:43,666
Somehow I just can't control myself

587
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:46,666
Every time I see them, touching skin to skin

588
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:49,166
My mind goes, my mind goes...

589
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,166
AAH!

590
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:14,466
Could he be right, am I pushing leaders for the light

591
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:17,666
With all of these disciples of romance driven blind

592
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:21,166
Cuz somebody save me, the urge to forsake

593
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:24,166
The incense of shifts within this wicked play

594
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:29,666
The power of resting in my hands

595
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:32,166
Oh my God, it's a perfect plan

596
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:38,666
And salvation, I can live my life
as an ordinary girl

597
00:34:39,366 --> 00:34:41,666
I can't resist them anymore

598
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:44,366
Cuz I smell strawberries galore

599
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,166
All the trauma from a couple's soul

600
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,966
Could never be the devil in me

601
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:52,666
And I'm a sinner 'til I die

602
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:55,466
What's the harm if I don't mind

603
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:58,166
Cuz the power within empowers me

604
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:00,166
I can live a sinful life

605
00:35:23,249 --> 00:35:24,549

Are you ready?

656
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:19,549

If you break your nose, it's eight to ten. What are you? Maybe it's possible to be satisfied.

クワバラ　クワバラ　クワバラ
Kuwabara kuwabara kuwabara

A speed that the eye can't keep up with. Living worldly desires. Unbearable. Without resisting, I push through my selfishness.

そこどけ　大蛇か　またわらわ　もといのあなた
Get out of the way. Is it a giant snake? Or is it me? Or rather, you.

00:39:58,149 --> 00:39:59,949
さぁどっちだいい？　どっちもいいさ　ヨミナヨ

682
00:40:18,006 --> 00:40:19,606
瞳が重なったら
When our eyes meet

Heart, body, head, somehow pulsing

684

00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:31,106

Our eyes definitely met just now, making a face like that is the end

胸の奥に居ついてる メロディ リズムに

718
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:54,606
There's an answer out there somewhere

719
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:57,006
When the Muses whisper "truth or dare?"

720
00:42:57,306 --> 00:42:59,306
The hands of fate play tug-of-war

721
00:42:59,306 --> 00:43:00,806
But no one's keeping score

722
00:43:01,006 --> 00:43:03,006
Stay the course and be tenacious

723
00:43:03,006 --> 00:43:05,006
'Cause the future is a game of chance

724
00:43:05,106 --> 00:43:07,106
The chips are down, but I'm all in

725
00:43:07,106 --> 00:43:08,806
I play until I win

726
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:11,006
I'm not gonna give up now

727
00:43:11,106 --> 00:43:13,306
The wheels of fortune circle back around

728
00:43:13,506 --> 00:43:15,506
A new turn in the betting ring

729
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:17,606
A maze of outcomes drawn in golden string

730
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:20,006
And through this tangled thread, I see what's up ahead

731
00:43:21,106 --> 00:43:23,106
A wild chase, a frantic pace

732
00:43:23,306 --> 00:43:25,706
I got to try my luck, I'm spinning fate

733
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:30,606
Ah... da da da da da da da

734
00:43:32,106 --> 00:43:34,106
I'm always spinning fate

735
00:43:36,106 --> 00:43:38,106
Whoah yeah

736
00:43:41,106 --> 00:43:43,106
Spin the roulette, see where it falls

737
00:43:43,106 --> 00:43:45,106
Testing the limits and betting it all

738
00:43:45,106 --> 00:43:47,106
Round and around, jumping into the circle

739
00:43:47,106 --> 00:43:49,006
Over and over, a test of will

740
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:51,106
Oh, the game is never easy

741
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:53,106
And the outcome is a mystery

742
00:43:53,306 --> 00:43:55,306
But these are fates worth betting on

743
00:43:55,306 --> 00:43:57,206
Their threads unbroken

744
00:43:57,506 --> 00:44:00,006
Called to life by flaxen string

745
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:03,606
Casting lots together at the start of everything

746
00:44:05,106 --> 00:44:07,106
I'm not gonna give up yet

747
00:44:07,106 --> 00:44:09,106
I spin back 'round with every chance I get

748
00:44:09,306 --> 00:44:11,006
The wheel turns and the die is cast

749
00:44:11,306 --> 00:44:13,306
The time has come for fate to change at last

750
00:44:13,506 --> 00:44:15,606
And if it's black or red, I'm moving up ahead

751
00:44:17,006 --> 00:44:19,006
A perfect chance, a daring dance

752
00:44:19,106 --> 00:44:22,006
I'll spin this thread of fate with my own hands

753
00:44:24,306 --> 00:44:26,606
Ooh la la la

754
00:44:27,606 --> 00:44:31,506
I'm taking fate into my hands

755
00:44:32,306 --> 00:44:34,306
Whoah, yeah

756
00:44:37,606 --> 00:44:41,506
And through this tangled thread, I see what's up ahead

757
00:44:41,606 --> 00:44:44,706
And through this tangled thread, I see what's up ahead

758
00:44:51,006 --> 00:44:53,606
New song, new song, new song!

759
00:44:53,606 --> 00:44:55,306
Yatta!

760
00:44:55,306 --> 00:44:58,506
It's our first song as a trio, you guys!

761
00:44:58,506 --> 00:45:01,206
Yeah! Oh, true!

762
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:01,590
So now that I'm thinking about it...

763
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,390
Yeah! It's only like 2 minutes.

764
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,290
That's a good workout.

765
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:09,690
Yeah. I guess it's because of all the Zoomers and like it's short nowadays, huh?

766
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:10,990
That's what everybody says.

767
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:11,990
They say you.

768
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:12,990
Not me!

769
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,190
Certainly not.

770
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:17,690
But yeah, unfortunately, this was also the last song for this live!

771
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:18,990
えー？
Ehhhh?

772
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:20,490
But...

773
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,190
Yes, but!

774
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:23,990
But the music video for our 5th anniversary song

775
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:26,690
Fortune Spinner will premiere on

776
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,990
the Hololive English official YouTube channel

777
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:30,390
right after this concert!

778
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:32,590
So make sure you stick around, okay?

779
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:33,390
Don't miss it!

780
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:34,190
Don't you dare!

781
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,390
Don't miss it.

782
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:36,690
Make sure you watch it a lot

783
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,390
and loop it a lot, please.

784
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,090
Yeah! Yeah.

785
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:41,690
そうですね！そうですね！
That's right! That's right!

786
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,290
Stuff some celebrating to do, right?

787
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:46,190
That's right. I think it's time because it's the end

788
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,690
that we kind of celebrate ourselves here. 5 years!

789
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:50,190
Are we ready for that? Yes!

790
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,690
Yes, we are ready! Okay, let's do it!

791
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:55,690
Let's do it! Let's do it!

792
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,990
Oh! What is that cake over there that is not mine?

793
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:00,190
Hey! Oh, come on!

794
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:04,690
Be-be-be careful! Come on, come on!

795
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:07,990
Can we... can we... talk about how delicious it looks?

796
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:10,690
Yeah! Now I can't see it properly

797
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,690
because of the way you're talking about it.

798
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,390
It's big though. It's almost bigger than Ina!

799
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:15,690
Oh yeah. Hey!

800
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,690
Hey, stop stop stop. Not now, not now.

801
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:18,690
Eh! Don't pick off the strawberry!

802
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:21,190
Hold your horses. Let's eat it later

803
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,390
and celebrate later, later, later.

804
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:24,690
And look, there's trophies!

805
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:27,690
Yeah! I saw that! We can do an award show, right?

806
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,390
Staff somewhere actually got us trophies!

807
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,390
Yeah, they were listening! Thank you!

808
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,390
They followed our shopping list accordingly.

809
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:36,690
Okay, 5 years, we deserve an award.

810
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:38,990
Yeah. We had so many meaningful accomplishments,

811
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,190
so let's see what they all are, okay?

812
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,690
Okay! Who's it gonna be? Yeah!

813
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:45,690
Should I start? I'll take mine.

814
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:48,690
Hshyuu! Our awarding... God bless you.

815
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:51,690
God bless you. Sorry. Jya-jya-jya-jyan!

816
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:55,690
Hshyuu! Oh! God bless you. Sorry,

817
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:57,990
I'm not trying to disrupt your award ceremony.

818
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:59,390
What did you get? What did you get?

819
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:03,390
High! I have... my award is... let's see... uh...

820
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:08,690
Most Meals Cooked Award ~Takanashi Kiara~

821
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:08,690
I think it says 'Most Meals Cooked Award' ~Takanashi Kiara~.

822
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:11,390
She's cooking in Holo EN! Let her cook!

823
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:13,690
Let her cook! Let her cook! Let her keep doing it!

824
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:16,690
She has been cooking a lot. She has a lot of meals.

825
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:19,690
Yeah, thank you. I think that's what that's about,

826
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:22,690
mostly it's about me living a healthy lifestyle

827
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:25,190
and then cooking many meals at home.

828
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:29,690
Yeah. I wish I could cook for you girls someday.

829
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:32,190
Someday! I hope you guys

830
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:35,190
enjoyed my performances today!

831
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:38,390
I am so proud to stand here with my gen-mates

832
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:41,390
even on this day after so many years.

833
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:44,390
I will continue to work hard, of course,

834
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:47,190
so that I can maybe gather even more awards.

835
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:50,190
I will put this on my shelf at home where my cats

836
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:52,690
will also probably put a lot of fur on it.

837
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:55,690
Or knock it down. Meow, meow, no!

838
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,690
Meow, meow! They like to do that.

839
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:00,690
Is it out of real glass? It's kind of heavy,

840
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:03,390
I have to be careful. Careful. Yeah.

841
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:05,690
Thank you guys so much! I love you girls!

842
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:08,690
(Mwah mwah mwah) It's been an honor so far,

843
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:11,390
so let's do our best together!

844
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,690
Thank you for this award!

845
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,690
Woo! Who's next? Who's next?

846
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,690
Is it Ina'nis?

847
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,690
Me? Oh, could my award be, let's see...

848
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:25,690
yoi-sho! Yoi-sho! Most violent? Yikes.

849
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:29,390
100% not violent. You do it to yourself.

850
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:32,190
You do it to Ina. All right.

851
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:37,190
My award is... oh yes... oh yes... I already got... It is...

852
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:41,390
Most Time Spent on the Floor Award ~Ninomae Ina'nis~

853
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:41,390
It is 'Most Time Spent on the Floor Award' ~Ninomae Ina'nis~.

854
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,190
Oh, that I believe! Yay!

855
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,190
おめでとう！Congratulations!
Congratulations! Congratulations!

856
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:48,190
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

857
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:51,690
I know you guys probably think I would never get this award,

858
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:54,190
but you know, I worked so hard this year

859
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,690
to stay on the floor. Very unprecedented.

860
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:59,990
And uh, yeah. Not only did I stay on the floor,

861
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:02,690
I really did my best to practice dancing

862
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,690
and singing this year to perform well with you guys.

863
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:08,690
And I hope that you guys see that as well.

864
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:12,690
Thank you so much for all your support.

865
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:15,690
I'll continue to do my best with these girls.

866
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,690
Yeah! Let's keep doing it! Thank you! Myth! Myth!

867
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:21,190
And last but not least... Calliope-mon.

868
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:24,190
Oh, what could it be? Oh, what could it be?

869
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,690
Our sneezier... the most sneezes today.

870
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:29,390
The most sneezes in the Myth 5th anniversary showcase.

871
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,190
Most blessed. Okay, well, actually,

872
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:36,390
my trophy is for... jya-jya-jyan!

873
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:36,390
Best Worst Luck Award ~Mori Calliope~

874
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,690
Best Worst Luck, especially in games

875
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,690
where there are microtransactions.

876
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:45,690
Hehe! That's not so boss. Yeah, I mean,

877
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,690
I've seen it happen in real time. But the dedication,

878
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:52,190
the determination to pull a signed card...

879
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:56,190
I'm not gonna give up yet. (Singing slightly)

880
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,390
I'm gonna be very sappy. Okay.

881
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,190
I really like that line, I'm not gonna give up.

882
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,547
...gonna give up yet because, because

883
00:50:01,547 --> 00:50:04,847
I'd like to think that we're not gonna give up yet

884
00:50:04,847 --> 00:50:07,847
because there's still so much that I want to do...

885
00:50:07,847 --> 00:50:11,047
...the three of us together. Together!

886
00:50:11,047 --> 00:50:11,947
Together!

887
00:50:11,947 --> 00:50:13,447
You know!

888
00:50:13,447 --> 00:50:17,247
And I didn't think that I would be here

889
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:18,847
five years from the start with you guys.

890
00:50:18,847 --> 00:50:19,647
Same!

891
00:50:19,647 --> 00:50:20,147
Yeah.

892
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:22,247
I really thought I'd be out of here.

893
00:50:22,247 --> 00:50:22,847
Same!

894
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:26,747
But now I can't... I can't see a future where

895
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:28,147
I'm not here with you guys. So for now...

896
00:50:28,147 --> 00:50:29,247
Oh, so nice!

897
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,247
That's it!

898
00:50:30,247 --> 00:50:31,247
Oh, shucks!

899
00:50:31,247 --> 00:50:32,247
Okay!

900
00:50:32,547 --> 00:50:34,547
So because of that, I'm not gonna give up yet.

901
00:50:34,547 --> 00:50:36,747
I don't want to give up yet.

902
00:50:36,747 --> 00:50:38,447
So let's do our best!

903
00:50:39,647 --> 00:50:42,047
Oh yeah, the wrapping-up jingle is playing!

904
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:45,047
I'm just gonna start talking about nothing because it

905
00:50:45,047 --> 00:50:47,647
annoys me when they play the jingle to tell me to stop.

906
00:50:47,647 --> 00:50:50,247
This morning I ate a bagel and I had cream cheese on it.

907
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,747
It was delicious but it went over my budget.

908
00:50:52,747 --> 00:50:55,047
I'm in big trouble with my trainer.

909
00:50:55,047 --> 00:50:55,547
Safe!

910
00:50:55,547 --> 00:50:58,047
But anyway, I'm not... you can't get rid of me!

911
00:50:58,047 --> 00:50:58,747
All right!

912
00:50:58,747 --> 00:51:02,247
You can't get rid of any of us, hopefully!

913
00:51:02,247 --> 00:51:05,647
Everybody, all good things come to an end, unfortunately.

914
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:08,447
But thank you so much to the hololive English community

915
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:10,747
for supporting us continuously for five years.

916
00:51:10,747 --> 00:51:13,247
Thank you to the girls today and all the staff

917
00:51:13,247 --> 00:51:15,747
and sound guys that supported us also for this celebration,

918
00:51:15,747 --> 00:51:17,247
who gave us the trophies!

919
00:51:17,247 --> 00:51:18,247
Yeah!

920
00:51:18,247 --> 00:51:19,747
Once again, congratulations to us! To us!

921
00:51:19,747 --> 00:51:21,547
Yeah! Five years of hololive English -Myth-!

Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

00:51:28,247 --> 00:51:29,247
Peace!

925
00:51:29,447 --> 00:51:31,247

931
00:51:43,547 --> 00:51:47,047
We have hololive English -Myth-'s 5th anniversary

First up, we've got the Mirror Acrylic Panel!

935
00:51:55,547 --> 00:51:58,747
It's designed so that the surroundings and background

936
00:51:58,747 --> 00:52:01,247
of the illustration have a metallic mirrored vibe.

937
00:52:01,247 --> 00:52:02,547
Oh, so cool!

938
00:52:02,547 --> 00:52:05,747
I absolutely love this illustration. Hope you guys do too!

939
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,247
Next up, we have the collection cards!

940
00:52:08,247 --> 00:52:11,447
These cards feature a shiny metallic finish

941
00:52:11,447 --> 00:52:13,747
and you can choose from three different designs.

942
00:52:16,747 --> 00:52:19,747
Also, the backside is matching for us all.

943
00:52:21,247 --> 00:52:24,247
Make sure to get the one from your oshi for sure!

944
00:52:24,247 --> 00:52:27,447
Next up, we have the coin medals!

945
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:31,047
Our shiny 5th anniversary commemorative coin medals!

946
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:34,247
There's one design for each member, and the backsides

947
00:52:34,247 --> 00:52:37,247
also have a common design.

948
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:41,247
They come in an antique gold-plated finish

949
00:52:41,247 --> 00:52:42,747
inside the original packaging.

950
00:52:42,747 --> 00:52:44,447
Ooh, so shiny!

951
00:52:45,547 --> 00:52:47,547
Oh man, everything looks so good!

952
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:51,547
But I'm especially interested in what we have

953
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:52,747
to show you guys next.

954
00:52:52,747 --> 00:52:55,547
Next up, we have the Anniversary Hats!

955
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,747
So first up, Anniversary Hat - Mori Calliope!

956
00:52:58,747 --> 00:53:01,447
This one uses a soft fluffy fabric.

957
00:53:01,447 --> 00:53:04,747
The Death-sensei part is removable so you can also

958
00:53:04,747 --> 00:53:08,447
rock it without him. Make sure that you check it out.

959
00:53:08,447 --> 00:53:09,547
It's super stylish!

960
00:53:09,547 --> 00:53:12,047
I love the shape so much and...

961
00:53:12,047 --> 00:53:14,547
all of my members (Deadbeats) voted on it together.

962
00:53:14,547 --> 00:53:15,747
So hope that you guys will enjoy!

963
00:53:15,747 --> 00:53:18,247
Next up, we have mine!

964
00:53:18,247 --> 00:53:20,747
The Anniversary Hat from Takanashi Kiara!

965
00:53:20,747 --> 00:53:22,247
Looks like this!

966
00:53:22,247 --> 00:53:24,247
Decorative parts are removable.

967
00:53:24,247 --> 00:53:28,247
It can be worn reversibly, inside out,

968
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:30,247
so you'll have a different color then!

969
00:53:30,247 --> 00:53:33,547
And it's a bucket hat style design, which we

970
00:53:33,547 --> 00:53:35,747
didn't have before for me. Very fashionable, I must say!

971
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:38,447
Last but not least, we have my hat!

972
00:53:38,447 --> 00:53:41,247
The Anniversary Hat - Ninomae Ina'nis!

973
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,447
The ribbon part is removable and the patches are

974
00:53:44,447 --> 00:53:46,247
super cute too. You can wear it to become Takodachi!

975
00:53:46,247 --> 00:53:47,547
Yes!

976
00:53:49,247 --> 00:53:53,247
And yeah, you can mix and match with or without

977
00:53:53,247 --> 00:53:54,247
the ribbon for different looks.

978
00:53:54,247 --> 00:53:56,747
So everybody, be sure to check our merch out!

979
00:53:56,747 --> 00:53:59,747

986

KIKKERIKI!
These 5 years were super crazy!

988
00:54:13,447 --> 00:54:17,647
It was up's and down's but in the end we stayed
together and I grew and learnt so much!!

989
00:54:17,647 --> 00:54:21,847
Every moment shared with you guys is forever in
my heart and I'm looking forward for more...

...years together!! Love, Kiara
