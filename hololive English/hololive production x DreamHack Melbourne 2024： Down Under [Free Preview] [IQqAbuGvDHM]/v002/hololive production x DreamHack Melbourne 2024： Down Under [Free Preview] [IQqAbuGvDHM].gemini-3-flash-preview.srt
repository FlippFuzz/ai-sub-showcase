The longer we wait...

102
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:03,677
The stronger it makes us...

103
00:35:03,677 --> 00:35:05,677
...as we fight every fate.

104
00:35:06,677 --> 00:35:08,477

105
00:35:08,477 --> 00:35:10,677

Stories told in gentle blue light.

111
00:35:31,177 --> 00:35:34,177
Painted wishes grounded by the tide.

112
00:35:34,677 --> 00:35:37,577
Longest paths connecting the dots.

113
00:35:37,877 --> 00:35:41,177
Faint echoes of ages gone by.

114
00:35:41,777 --> 00:35:44,377
Made a splash but found that I'm free.

115
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:48,177
A fish out of water, bound to the sea.

116
00:35:48,677 --> 00:35:51,177
Though the reckless high tide brought you right by my side...

117
00:35:51,977 --> 00:35:55,477
...I bet this moment's the wave we can ride.

118
00:35:55,977 --> 00:35:59,977
Connecting songs across the sky.

119
00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:03,377
Take off and fly...

120
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:04,377
The longer we wait...

121
00:36:04,377 --> 00:36:06,477
The stronger it makes us...

122
00:36:06,477 --> 00:36:09,177
...as we fight every fate.

123
00:36:09,777 --> 00:36:11,477
Strength to finally defeat...

124
00:36:11,477 --> 00:36:15,977
...this journey of a thousand years to me.

125
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:21,177
Witness the fire in our minds, burning inside...

126
00:36:21,177 --> 00:36:23,177
...rising again from the ashes.

127
00:36:23,477 --> 00:36:25,977
Every bruise and the scratches make us feel more alive.

128
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:27,677
We never give up, never give in...

129
00:36:27,677 --> 00:36:28,977
...no matter what's ahead.

130
00:36:28,977 --> 00:36:31,677
Instead we'll cast our worries aside.

131
00:36:32,177 --> 00:36:35,577
There's no world for us to touch or to see.

132
00:36:35,577 --> 00:36:39,177
We'll make it ourselves, then make memories.

133
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:42,677
There ain't a mystery our brains cannot solve.

134
00:36:42,677 --> 00:36:46,477
We just shine brighter, grow tighter, evolve.

135
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:50,977
Connecting songs across the world.

136
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:53,977
Take off and fly...

137
00:36:53,977 --> 00:36:54,977
The longer we wait...

138
00:36:54,977 --> 00:36:56,977
The stronger it makes us...

139
00:36:56,977 --> 00:36:59,477
...as we fight every fate.

140
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:01,977
Strength to finally defeat...

141
00:37:01,977 --> 00:37:06,477
...this journey of a thousand years to me.

142
00:37:07,677 --> 00:37:10,577
At the end of this world, where's our fighting chance?

143
00:37:14,477 --> 00:37:16,977
Nothing's changing, it's always the same story...

144
00:37:16,977 --> 00:37:20,677
...staged with a different dance.

145
00:37:21,577 --> 00:37:23,377
Gotta have a happy end...

146
00:37:23,377 --> 00:37:24,477
...for me, my friends...

147
00:37:24,477 --> 00:37:26,677
...and those who've loved us until now.

148
00:37:27,677 --> 00:37:30,477
I wanna see your smile...

149
00:37:32,577 --> 00:37:34,377
...with you, somehow.

150
00:37:34,977 --> 00:37:36,377
Take off and fly...

151
00:37:36,377 --> 00:37:37,477
The longer we wait...

152
00:37:37,477 --> 00:37:39,377

156
00:37:49,577 --> 00:37:51,477

どこどこ？
Where is it?

309
00:47:33,414 --> 00:47:38,214
Well, while she's figuring that out, uh, should we do introductions?

310
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,614
見つけた！
I found it!

311
00:47:40,614 --> 00:47:41,614
Oh, I can speak again!

312
00:47:41,614 --> 00:47:43,214
Oh, she's back!

313
00:47:43,214 --> 00:47:44,214
We good.

314
00:47:45,014 --> 00:47:47,514
Hi! I'm alive, which is ironic.

315
00:47:47,514 --> 00:47:50,214
Hey everybody, what's up?!

316
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:55,414
Hey guys, I guess we should do an introduction.

317
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,614
Yeah, yeah, yeah! You go first, you go first.

318
00:47:57,614 --> 00:48:00,014
I guess because I am Senpai, here I go.

319
00:48:00,014 --> 00:48:01,514
皆さーん！
Everyone!

320
00:48:01,514 --> 00:48:04,114
It's me, Mori Calliope from hololive English!

321
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:07,714
Hardworking Shinigami reaper-rapper-singer.

322
00:48:07,714 --> 00:48:10,214
Nice to meet you! What's up?

323
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,514
Who is that?

324
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,614
Who am I?

325
00:48:13,614 --> 00:48:16,214
Wassup!!

326
00:48:18,414 --> 00:48:21,214
I am Hakos Baelz!

327
00:48:21,214 --> 00:48:24,714
Your local Aussie rat has come home!!

328
00:48:27,714 --> 00:48:30,714
I am Baelz from hololive English! Witness me!

329
00:48:30,714 --> 00:48:32,214
Witness!

330
00:48:32,214 --> 00:48:33,514
Witness me!

331
00:48:33,514 --> 00:48:35,214
Witness! Alright!

332
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:40,714
So, some of you may already know, I think a lot of you already know of us,

333
00:48:41,014 --> 00:48:45,514
but I'm gonna tell you a little bit about VTubers for those that don't know.

334
00:48:45,514 --> 00:48:47,714
So, let me clear something up.

335
00:48:47,914 --> 00:48:49,214
Not AI! We're not AI!

336
00:48:49,714 --> 00:48:51,714
We're not AI! No, no, no!

337
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:54,214
We are many things.

338
00:48:54,214 --> 00:48:57,214
Um, we are singers, dancers, performers.

339
00:48:57,214 --> 00:48:58,714
A lot of us are gamers.

340
00:48:58,714 --> 00:49:00,014
I know some of you guys are gamers.

341
00:49:00,014 --> 00:49:03,214
You gamers? You gamers?

342
00:49:03,214 --> 00:49:05,314
Gamer here, gamer there. I see them everywhere.

343
00:49:05,314 --> 00:49:07,714
But, but the main thing is, we are REAL!

344
00:49:07,714 --> 00:49:10,214
We just look like this.

345
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:12,814
We are real! Yeah!

346
00:49:12,814 --> 00:49:16,214
Like any other performer or, you know, singer, dancer, gamer, etc.,

347
00:49:17,014 --> 00:49:19,714
we are real people. We just look like this.

348
00:49:19,714 --> 00:49:21,214
That's the only difference, right?

349
00:49:21,214 --> 00:49:24,214
Hee-hee! And we belong to hololive production!

350
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:27,714
Anyone know hololive production?

351
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:28,714
You know us?!

352
00:49:28,714 --> 00:49:30,214
Yes! And for those who don't know,

353
00:49:30,214 --> 00:49:34,514
hololive production is a virtual idol agency that is based in Japan,

354
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:37,714
but we are also reaching overseas!

355
00:49:37,714 --> 00:49:40,614
We want to become worldwide!!

356
00:49:40,614 --> 00:49:42,714
Yeah, worldwide!

357
00:49:42,714 --> 00:49:44,114
I have a question, though.

358
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:44,414
Yes.

359
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:47,714
Are you guys having a good time so far?!

360
00:49:48,614 --> 00:49:50,714
And how about you guys watching on the stream?

361
00:49:50,714 --> 00:49:52,714
Oh yes! We know a lot of you guys are watching.

362
00:49:52,714 --> 00:49:54,714
We see you! We see you! There you are!

00:49:54,714 --> 00:49:57,814
Oh, yeah! 見てくれてありがとうございます！
Oh, yeah! Thank you for watching!

364
00:49:57,814 --> 00:49:58,714

00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:00,806
...です。
...I'm looking forward to it.

367
00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:02,252
Calli, we made it.

368
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:02,936
We did.

369
00:50:03,018 --> 00:50:04,590
We're in Melbourne!

370
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:06,198
Oh my god, it's a real place!

371
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,706
Are you sure?

372
00:50:07,706 --> 00:50:08,518
Are you sure?

373
00:50:08,597 --> 00:50:09,637
We're in Melbourne.

374
00:50:09,727 --> 00:50:13,406
They didn't just fly us somewhere else, like, maybe a different...

375
00:50:13,406 --> 00:50:15,495
...like, some place like, like off of like, normal map?

376
00:50:15,564 --> 00:50:18,629
No, it's real. It's real. We're real. They're real.

377
00:50:18,696 --> 00:50:20,711
Or they just take us to London or something like that?

378
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:22,173
Did you say Mel-bin?

379
00:50:22,238 --> 00:50:23,222
What was that? Did you say Mel-bin?

380
00:50:23,296 --> 00:50:24,163
Melbourne.

381
00:50:24,236 --> 00:50:25,166
Mel-bin.

382
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,616
What?!

383
00:50:26,701 --> 00:50:28,209
Is there something wrong with the way I said Melbourne?

384
00:50:28,289 --> 00:50:28,606
Mel-bin.

385
00:50:28,606 --> 00:50:28,906
Melbourne.

386
00:50:28,906 --> 00:50:29,206
Mel-bin.

387
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:29,706
Melbourne.

388
00:50:33,848 --> 00:50:35,106
What? What's wrong?

389
00:50:35,106 --> 00:50:37,206
You've got to give me something, Bae. You've got to give me something.

390
00:50:37,206 --> 00:50:38,406
What am I saying?

391
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:40,606
Uh, you're doing it perfectly, right guys?

392
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,506
It's Mel-bin. It's Mel-bin. It's Mel-bin. It's Mel-bin.

393
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,806
Am I saying it better now? Mel-burn?

394
00:50:46,938 --> 00:50:49,206
No. Mel-bin. Mel-bin. Mel...

395
00:50:49,306 --> 00:50:50,206
...burn?

396
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:51,206
Yeah, close enough.

397
00:50:51,306 --> 00:50:52,706
Alright.

398
00:50:53,106 --> 00:50:54,606
But yeah, we've arrived in Melbourne...

399
00:50:54,606 --> 00:50:56,706
...and we're so excited to be here!

400
00:50:58,106 --> 00:51:00,206
That's right. There's a lot of stuff here, actually.

401
00:51:00,206 --> 00:51:01,206
Yes, there is!

402
00:51:01,306 --> 00:51:02,706
There's like art all over the place...

403
00:51:02,706 --> 00:51:04,706
...and like, really good food.

404
00:51:04,806 --> 00:51:06,206
Yes! The chicken's so good!

405
00:51:06,306 --> 00:51:08,706
The chicken is so good!

406
00:51:10,706 --> 00:51:13,706
Um, yeah. So, Melbourne is known for a lot of things.

407
00:51:13,806 --> 00:51:15,706
But if you know me...

408
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:18,206
...obviously caffeine is my jam.

409
00:51:18,306 --> 00:51:21,206
For those who are new to Melbourne, I highly encourage you to check out all the coffee shops...

410
00:51:21,306 --> 00:51:26,706
...'cause the coffee is the best in Mel-burn!

411
00:51:29,806 --> 00:51:33,706
But yeah, please do check out Melbourne if you guys have the chance. There's a lot of cool things...

412
00:51:33,806 --> 00:51:37,706
...a lot of museums, galleries, and plenty of fun experiences for you to try!

413
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:38,706
That's right.

414
00:51:38,806 --> 00:51:41,706
Also, speaking of loving chicken, hey, you in the crowd...

415
00:51:41,706 --> 00:51:44,206
...who did like the TakaMori like fanart of me and Kiara like kissing thing...

416
00:51:44,306 --> 00:51:48,206
...you're not going to get away with that. I'm just letting you know you're not getting away.

417
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:50,206
Good job. Good job. Good job.

418
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:51,206
Hey, I told you, good job.

419
00:51:51,306 --> 00:51:52,206
Don't encourage them!

420
00:51:53,206 --> 00:51:54,706
Anyway, anyway, we do have a bit of sad news.

421
00:51:54,806 --> 00:51:56,706
Yes, we do have sad news for you guys.

422
00:51:56,806 --> 00:52:00,206
