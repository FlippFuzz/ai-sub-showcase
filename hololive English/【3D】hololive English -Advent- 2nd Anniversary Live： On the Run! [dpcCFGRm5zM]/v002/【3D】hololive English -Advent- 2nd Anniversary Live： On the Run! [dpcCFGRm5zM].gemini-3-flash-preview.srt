it's been two years since we broke out of the cell, huh?

00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:18,908
Wait...

41
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:19,408
It has been...

42
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:21,008
Yeah, time goes by fast.

43
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:22,008
Yeah.

44
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:24,208
We've been through a lot, right?

45
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,208
Mm-hm.

46
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,108
Huh?

00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:26,508
What?

Hey, guys!

49
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:29,608
What's that over there?!

50
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:31,908
Huh?

51
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:38,208
Attention.

57
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:50,808
Five escapees detected from the cell.

58
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:52,508
Targets are as follows:

59
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:55,108

60
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:57,208

00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,008

Fuwawa Abyssgard.

65
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,908
The Fuzzy One,

66
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:10,008
Mococo Abyssgard.

67
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,708
The Archiver,

68
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,908
Shiori Novella.

69
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:15,508
All units,

70
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,808
apprehend the Advent members immediately.

71
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:26,508
Wait!

72
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:28,008
No! We're in trouble!

73
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:30,008
Oh no, where are we?!

74
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:34,508
Oh my god! They're catching us!

75
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:50,008
We can't get out!

76
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:52,508
Oh no! They're so fast!

77
00:06:52,508 --> 00:06:54,008
Wait! Stop!

78
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:57,008
Where are we even going?

79
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,008
Think! There's got to be a solution for this, right?

80
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:01,008
Okay, think!

81
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:03,208
Piggyback ride! Come on!

82
00:07:03,408 --> 00:07:06,008
On! On! Piggyback ride!

83
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:11,208
Okay, maybe not that one.

84
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:12,508
Sorry.

85
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,508
There has to be something though, like a Plan B or something we can do.

86
00:07:16,108 --> 00:07:18,808
Bwahaha! Struggling already?

87
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:20,108
Huh?

88
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:22,008
Oh my god! It's Pokey!

89
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,508
What are you doing here?

90
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:25,808
Finally show your face, huh?

91
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:29,208
Ask nicely enough, and maybe I'll save your skins.

92
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:30,008
Yeah!

93
00:07:30,008 --> 00:07:32,508
I'll punch you for real! Come on, come on!

94
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,008
Okay... um... please?

95
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:36,508
I have a solution.

96
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:39,508
Don't please him! How fast, Pokey?

97
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:41,808
Hmph! I don't hate that.

98
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:45,008
If you manage to pass the little trial I've cooked up for you,

99
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:47,408
I'll whisk you away to a whole other realm...

100
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,008
One where your pesky pursuers can't reach you!

101
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:53,008
I mean, I guess that's our only option, huh?

102
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:55,308
Oh well, I guess we will do it.

103
00:07:56,108 --> 00:08:00,008
Alright. I've prepared something special. Arise, my go-karts!

104
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:06,008
Go-Kart Escape / 逃走ゴーカート
Go-Kart Escape

105
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:09,308
What if we don't have a license?

106
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:11,808
Wait, what's with all the Biboo-themed stuff?

107
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,508
Yeah, I actually like that.

108
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:19,408
See this course? Time to tackle the "Go-Kart Escape Challenge"!

109
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:23,008
Go-Kart Escape Challenge!

110
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:26,508
Yes, that's right. Take it from here, ankle-biter.

111
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:28,008
Eh?!

112
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,808
Who are you talking to, huh?

113
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:33,208
Ankle-biter?! Yeah, calm down there.

114
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:35,408
Well, actually...

115
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:38,208
Alright team, game rules are incoming,

116
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,108
so make sure you better listen, okay?

117
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,508
Yeah! Woo! Nice!

118
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:49,008
Wait, Bijou, how do you know the game rules?

119
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:50,508
Isn't it like...

120
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:52,508
It's the glasses.

121
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:54,008
That's how she knows.

122
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,008
Rule 1!

123
00:08:57,008 --> 00:09:01,008
Survive 2 laps with zombies on your tail!

124
00:08:56,508 --> 00:09:13,508
Rule 1: Survive 2 laps with zombies on your tail!

125
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:04,008
Zombies?! Where? Where?

126
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,508
Remember last year we beat up zombies?

127
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:11,208
Well, one of them went on a path to revenge

128
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,808
and now it's gonna run after you.

129
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:15,508
Run! Ah!

130
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:17,508
And now, Rule 2!

131
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:20,008
Collect items for bonus points,

132
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:23,008
but watch out because there'll be some that deduct points too!

133
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:26,508
Rule 2: Collect items for bonus points, but watch out for traps that deduct points!

134
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:26,508
Bonus points! Points are great! Oh no!

135
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,508
And then, Rule 3!

136
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:31,508
Victory is ours if we all get 30 points total. Easy, right?

137
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:32,508
Rule 3: Victory is ours if we all get 30 points total!

138
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:37,008
30 points! Did you hear that? 30 points! Oh yeah, we can do that!

139
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:41,008
Alright, and now I will explain the course items.

140
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,508
I must run.

141
00:09:42,508 --> 00:09:43,308
You must run?

142
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:45,308
Yeah, I must run. She must run with her people go.

143
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:48,308
I'm gonna live out my dreams while there's a track here.

144
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:51,308
Just ignore me. Ignore me. Keep listening.

145
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,008
Ah, there are... oh she's so fast! Wow!

146
00:09:54,508 --> 00:09:56,508
Anyway, there are crystals on the field!

147
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:59,408
The Biboo crystal over there

148
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:01,508
and two more over there.

149
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:03,008
They are gacha!

150
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:07,296
You'll either gain points or lose points based...

151
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:10,921
...but you don't know, so it's a risk every time.

152
00:10:11,796 --> 00:10:14,296
And then, there is the Big Moai!

153
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:16,796
Moai! The big Moai!

154
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:19,796
It will block your path.

155
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:26,296
It is minus 20 points if you hit it, so don't hit it.

156
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:30,296
Don't hit it! Yeah, don't hit it.

157
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,296
And then, the Pebble!

158
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:39,296
I have kidnapped one of my Pebbles to use as a sacrifice.

159
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:43,796
If you hit it, minus 5 points. But you know what?

160
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:47,796
I don't think Bijou would mind if you hit it, to be honest.

161
00:10:48,596 --> 00:10:52,796
And the items will change depending on your first lap or second lap.

162
00:10:52,796 --> 00:10:55,796
You're doing two laps. - Two laps!

163
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:09,796
I guess time to show you how it's done.

164
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:15,296
Alright, first lap, show us how to do it.

165
00:11:15,796 --> 00:11:17,296
I'm ready!

166
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:24,796
Go! Go Bijou! - Faster, faster!

167
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:27,796
She gets the first one! She makes it!

168
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:31,796
Second crystal, watch out!

169
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,796
Second lap, let's go!

170
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:42,796
Another crystal! She hit another one!

171
00:11:44,796 --> 00:11:48,796
The zombie's coming! Watch out!

172
00:11:58,596 --> 00:12:02,296
I think you got a bit of bad luck with that crystal at the end.

173
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:18,296
How many points did I get?

174
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:21,796
That's a good question. How many points did you get?

175
00:12:22,296 --> 00:12:24,796
I think you got one point.

176
00:12:22,796 --> 00:12:25,796
Bijou's Points: 1pt

177
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:30,296
What? One point? Was it all negative?

178
00:12:31,296 --> 00:12:36,296
It's a group effort, we can still get points.

179
00:12:36,796 --> 00:12:40,796
Just let the pro do all the work for you.

180
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:50,796
Show us how it's done, our fearless leader!

181
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:52,796
I have a plan.

182
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:58,296
You'll figure it out when I say "plan"!

183
00:13:02,596 --> 00:13:05,796
あの、ゾンビさん、先どうぞ。
Um, Mr. Zombie, please go ahead.

184
00:13:06,296 --> 00:13:09,796
えっ、何？いい子ですね、いい子ですね。
Eh, what? Such a good girl, such a good girl.

185
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:15,796
Let's go!

186
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:39,296
It's like driving in New York!

187
00:13:56,796 --> 00:14:00,796
It's not about the points, I just wanted to run them over.

188
00:14:02,796 --> 00:14:05,796
How many points did I get?

189
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:08,296
Three points!

190
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:15,796
Shiori's Points: 3pt

191
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:12,296
That's two more points than Bijou!

192
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:25,796
I'll get four points!

193
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:32,796
I'm pretty sure the zombie is not going to run away anymore...

194
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:34,796
...so I think he's tired.

195
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:37,296
It's up to you, you gotta outrun it! - I'm the best driver!

196
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:07,555
Alright, let's go!

197
00:15:07,555 --> 00:15:09,055
Bau bau!

198
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,055
I've got this, okay!

199
00:15:11,555 --> 00:15:13,555
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

200
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:16,055
Go, Fuwawa! Go, Fuwawa! Go, Fuwawa!

201
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:19,055
Go! Go! Why is it so small?

202
00:15:19,055 --> 00:15:22,055
Oh, this time... it's so big! Fuwawa!

203
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:25,055
The crystal! The crystal! Go!

204
00:15:25,555 --> 00:15:28,055
Watch out, watch out! Fuwawa, watch out! Watch out!

205
00:15:28,055 --> 00:15:30,055
Yeah! Go! You did it!

206
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,055
Is that the first lap still?

207
00:15:33,555 --> 00:15:35,055
It's the second one now!

208
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:38,055
I can do this! Bau bau!

209
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:40,055
Everything's okay! Bau bau!

210
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,055
Hurry, Fuwawa! Fuwawa!

211
00:15:43,555 --> 00:15:47,055
Go, Fuwawa! Go, Fuwawa! You can do it!

212
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:50,055
Go, Fuwawa! You're doing great! You're doing great!

213
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:54,055
Oh, watch out! Watch out! Nice drive!

214
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:57,055
I did it! I'm okay! Yeah!

215
00:15:57,555 --> 00:15:59,055
Bau bau!

216
00:16:00,055 --> 00:16:03,055
I guess the speed isn't that important, but the points are, right?

217
00:16:03,055 --> 00:16:04,555
Yeah! Bau bau, I think you did really well!

218
00:16:08,055 --> 00:16:10,555
Yeah, so far you're our top performer today...

219
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:12,555
...with 18 points!

220
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,555
18! Bau bau!

221
00:16:15,555 --> 00:16:17,555
Yeah, Fuwawa carry!

222
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:21,555
Wait, 18? Someone said 17.

223
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:24,055
18... 14... 18.

224
00:16:24,555 --> 00:16:27,055
Cause you got three, and you got one, so yeah.

225
00:16:27,055 --> 00:16:29,055
So it's 14... 18!

226
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:32,055
No no, we got 14 points!

227
00:16:32,555 --> 00:16:34,055
14 points! Okay!

228
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:37,055
I'm gonna get all the points!

229
00:16:37,055 --> 00:16:39,055
Look at me! Bau bau!

230
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:41,055
Bau bau! I'm gonna get them!

231
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:44,555
You got this, Mococo!

232
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:50,055
Go, Mococo! Go, Mococo!

233
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:54,055
I'll be faster eventually!

234
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,055
It's a slow burn! Yeah!

235
00:16:57,555 --> 00:16:59,055
Yeah!

236
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:02,555
Whoa! Watch out, watch out!

237
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:06,555
Yeah! Oh!

238
00:17:07,555 --> 00:17:10,055
I can do this! Bau bau! Bau bau!

239
00:17:10,555 --> 00:17:13,555
Watch out for the zombies! Bau bau!

240
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:16,055
Watch out! You're doing great!

241
00:17:18,555 --> 00:17:21,555
Watch out, watch out! Oh!

242
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:23,555
Yeah!

243
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:25,555
Bau bau!

244
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:28,055
How did you do, Mococo?

245
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:30,055
You could never catch me!

246
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:33,555
I think with you, we have enough!

247
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:36,055
Yeah, you got 12 points!

248
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,555
12 points!

249
00:17:38,555 --> 00:17:40,555
That's 18... that's 30, right?

250
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:44,055
High five! High five! Yeah!

251
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:46,555
I can get negative points!

252
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:48,555
You can't get negative points.

253
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:51,055
I can get negative points! It's still up to you!

254
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:55,055
Don't you hit anything! You're not gonna ruin it all for us!

255
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:58,055
Well, you know you guys, right?

256
00:17:59,055 --> 00:18:01,555
I have a driver's license, so I'm not worried about this at all.

257
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:05,055
Better than all of them! Don't trip over the zombies, huh?

258
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:08,555
I'm not scared of zombies.

259
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,055
That's what you say now!

260
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,055
I'm not scared.

261
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:16,555
Go Nerissa!

262
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:19,555
Wait, slow start! Nice, nice drive!

263
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:25,555
Whoa! Watch out, watch out! Exactly!

264
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:29,055
Wait, wait! Uh oh! Watch out! There's a zombie! Ahh!

265
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:35,055
I have a license! I can do this!

266
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:38,555
Nice, second lap, second lap! Go Nerissa!

267
00:18:38,555 --> 00:18:41,055
Drifty! Oh, look at her!

268
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:47,055
Yeah! I'm hitting everything! Whoa!

269
00:18:48,055 --> 00:18:51,055
Watch out! Careful, Advent! Yeah!

270
00:18:54,555 --> 00:18:56,555
I don't know if that went well.

271
00:18:57,555 --> 00:18:59,555
But I feel like I probably did better than you guys still.

272
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,555
Let's see if you got negative points!

273
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:05,055
I only spun out three times.

274
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:08,055
Yeah, only three times! You hit everything! This is not allowed!

275
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:10,555
Well, what are my points?

276
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:13,555
You got... what's the sign for 9?

277
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:16,555
You got 9 points!

278
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,055
9! Okay!

279
00:19:20,555 --> 00:19:22,555
That means we passed, right?

280
00:19:22,555 --> 00:19:25,055
The math is mathing! We passed!

281
00:19:26,055 --> 00:19:28,555
Yeah! We did it!

282
00:19:29,555 --> 00:19:32,055
High five! We did it!

283
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:34,055
Whoo! We did it!

284
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:37,555
What do you say, huh? Yeah! Do we get our deal?

285
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:39,055
Not bad!

286
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:42,555
As promised, interdimensional travel! All aboard!

287
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:44,555
Get in and go!

288
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:49,055
Wow, what a ride!

289
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,555
But let's crash it!

290
00:19:52,055 --> 00:19:53,555
No, I have a better idea, everyone.

291
00:19:54,055 --> 00:19:55,555
What idea? Yeah?

292
00:19:56,055 --> 00:19:58,555
Let's make a music video!

293
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:01,055
A music video! Whoa!

294
00:20:10,198 --> 00:20:11,998
Time to open up your eyes

295
00:20:12,098 --> 00:20:13,998
Feel the music start to rise

296
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:16,698
Got to break the world and let me in

297
00:20:17,398 --> 00:20:19,298
I know I was meant to be

298
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:21,298
Livin' life so fast and free

299
00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:23,298
Try to keep your eyes on me

300
00:20:23,398 --> 00:20:25,398
'Cause this is where my story all begins

301
00:20:25,498 --> 00:20:27,498
Livin' it up like crazy

302
00:20:27,598 --> 00:20:29,498
Ready to play come out with me

303
00:20:29,598 --> 00:20:31,498
Carried away so easy

304
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,398
I can't get enough

305
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:35,498
Free as a bird, no limit

306
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:37,498
Every word I'm feelin' it

307
00:20:37,598 --> 00:20:38,998
Get up and go, let's do this!

308
00:20:39,098 --> 00:20:40,598
Watch me, watch me, watch me, be your diva

309
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,598
I'm gonna raise your fever

310
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:44,598
Shakin' up all the crowd

311
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:46,598
Makin' some noise when I'm not allowed

312
00:20:46,698 --> 00:20:48,098
Livin' my life out loud

313
00:20:48,198 --> 00:20:52,098
I have awakened to wisdom beyond understanding

314
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:54,598
I keep indulging in my every whim

315
00:20:55,598 --> 00:20:58,398
Don't blame me if I shine too bright

316
00:20:59,598 --> 00:21:02,098
Can't help it if I start a light

317
00:21:02,598 --> 00:21:04,498
Now pay attention, please

318
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,598
'Cause this is only the beginning

319
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,598
It's our genesis!

320
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:10,998
Coming to wreak some havoc

321
00:21:11,098 --> 00:21:12,998
How do you like this product?

322
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:14,998
I'm embracing my madness

323
00:21:15,098 --> 00:21:15,998
Can you hear it?

324
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:18,498
Whispers banging down your window

325
00:21:18,598 --> 00:21:22,098
Rumors reaching a crescendo

326
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,598
No humble beginnings, I'm destined for great things

327
00:21:24,698 --> 00:21:29,098
I'm sure you've heard of me by now, woah

328
00:21:30,098 --> 00:21:32,598
Midnight, draw me to the dark side

329
00:21:32,698 --> 00:21:36,098
Daylight, take me on a joyride

330
00:21:36,198 --> 00:21:39,998
My crime is my passion, a mayhem in action

331
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,998
I know what day it is

332
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:46,098
This is our genesis

333
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,598
Gonna start the rave, when I misbehave, take center stage

334
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:53,598
Let the fun commence, but you know I'm gonna get intense

335
00:21:53,698 --> 00:21:56,598
There are loopholes unspoken, the rules can all be broken

336
00:21:56,698 --> 00:22:00,098
Amening on a rampage, the world is a blank page

337
00:22:00,598 --> 00:22:04,098
I'm writing my story in flames and in glory

338
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:07,598
They're gonna know me by name! Tonight!

339
00:22:09,098 --> 00:22:12,598
Is this my promised land?

340
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,098
The future's in my hands

341
00:22:16,098 --> 00:22:17,998
But they don't understand

342
00:22:18,098 --> 00:22:22,098
That I'm a sign of making, awaking, and taking a bow, bow, bow, bow

343
00:22:23,598 --> 00:22:25,598
Tell me how you like me now

344
00:22:37,598 --> 00:22:39,998
Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me

345
00:22:40,098 --> 00:22:42,998
Let your worries go, gonna show you how to lose control, honey

346
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:46,598
You've got to free your mind, leave your restraint behind

347
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,598
Be outrageous, the chaos is contagious

348
00:22:49,698 --> 00:22:51,598
Come on, you know what time it is!

349
00:22:51,698 --> 00:22:53,098
It's our genesis!

350
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:54,998
Time to open up your eyes

351
00:22:55,098 --> 00:22:56,998
Feel the music start to rise

352
00:22:57,098 --> 00:22:59,598
Got to break the world and let me in

353
00:23:00,098 --> 00:23:01,998
I know I was meant to be

354
00:23:02,098 --> 00:23:03,998
Livin' life so fast and free

355
00:23:04,098 --> 00:23:05,998
Try to keep your eyes on me

356
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:07,498
'Cause this is our beginning

357
00:23:07,598 --> 00:23:08,998
It's our genesis

358
00:23:09,098 --> 00:23:12,098
Whispers banging down your window

359
00:23:12,598 --> 00:23:15,598
Rumors reaching a crescendo

360
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:19,098
No humble beginnings, I'm destined for great things

361
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,998
I'm sure you've heard of me by now, woah

362
00:23:23,098 --> 00:23:26,098
Midnight, draw me to the dark side

363
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:30,098
Daylight, take me on a joyride

364
00:23:30,198 --> 00:23:33,998
My crime is my passion, a mayhem in action

365
00:23:34,098 --> 00:23:36,998
I know what day it is

366
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:39,598
This is our genesis

367
00:23:39,698 --> 00:23:44,098
Tell me what time it is! It's our genesis!

368
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:47,998
You know what time it is! It's our genesis!

369
00:23:48,098 --> 00:23:51,598
Tell me what time it is! It's our genesis!

370
00:24:00,098 --> 00:24:02,098
Everybody, look! It's the beach!

371
00:24:02,298 --> 00:24:04,198
It's the beach everywhere!

372
00:24:05,598 --> 00:24:08,098
It's amazing! Yeah! We're here!

373
00:24:08,598 --> 00:24:14,098
Check it out! Swimsuits! Is that Mococo? It's so cute!

374
00:24:17,598 --> 00:24:21,598
Oh, this is nice. Yeah, I like it. It feels nice and breathable.

375
00:24:23,098 --> 00:24:27,598
I want to see everyone close up though. This is our first time wearing something like this, so...

376
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:31,098
Bijou, won't you show off what you've got to us?

377
00:24:31,198 --> 00:24:33,598
Me first? Okay! Er...

378
00:24:33,698 --> 00:24:37,098
What you lookin' at, huh? What you lookin' at?

379
00:24:37,198 --> 00:24:39,098
Fine, you can look a little bit, okay?

380
00:24:39,198 --> 00:24:43,598
Here we go! See my skirt? You like the skirt? It's so glossy!

381
00:24:43,698 --> 00:24:46,098
Glossy! You're like a highlighter!

382
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:49,598
Kira-kira! I'm gonna blind you!

383
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:52,598
Oh! My eyes! Don't do to us at the beach! Who's next?

384
00:24:53,598 --> 00:24:56,598
Yeah, Fuwawa, take over! Go, go, go! It's sister time!

385
00:24:57,098 --> 00:25:02,098
Ah... This is kind of my first bathing suit, but, uh...

386
00:25:02,198 --> 00:25:04,098
What do you think?

387
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,390
Off-shot! Off-shot!

388
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,190
Off-shot!

389
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,590
Off-shot!

390
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,990
Yeah! Shiori, come here!

391
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,590
Shiori and her shorts!

392
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,590
Oh! Shiori's...

393
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,390
...at your service!

394
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,490
And look at my little ribbon!

395
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,090
Mococchi! Mococchi!

396
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,290
Okay, you can do this, Mococchi!

397
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,290
Bau bau! Bau bau!

398
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,890
Yeah! Mococchi,

399
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,290
you can do it! Come do it!

400
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,990
Does it suit me? Do you think I'm so cute?

401
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,190
Look at those cute shorts!

402
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,090
Hi! Hi!

403
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,590
She's so cute!

404
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,090
Ah! Oh! Yeah!

405
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,090
Mococchi, so cute!

406
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,990
And Nerissa! Nerissa!

407
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:04,290
Last, but... there's something a bit special on this outfit.

408
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:09,590
Don't you think if you go down...

409
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:14,590
...there it is! There it is!

410
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,290
Well, don't look there too much,

411
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,990
but if you come up, you can see my waist...

412
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,490
...and my... my top!

413
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,090
Armpits!

414
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:27,090
Yes, the pits! Okay! Hey!

415
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,090
But I see something strange off in the distance.

416
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,590
What is it?

417
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,190
Just, just wait. Let me go see.

418
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,890
Oh! It's a selfie stick!

419
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,290
Everyone get behind me!

420
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,490
Let's take a picture together!

421
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,890
Cheese! Nice!

422
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,590
Why is it so hot? Why is it so hot? You're so cute! Oh!

423
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,390
Oh, that helps!

424
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:56,090
Whoa! Hehe! Wow!

425
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,490
Oh, wait! Oh! Oh!

426
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,390
There's something down there in the sand.

427
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,090
Something down there? That...

428
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,090
...I think that's an Adventurer.

429
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,690
An Adventurer?

430
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,590
Oh! Someone stepped on them! Whoa!

431
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,090
Oh, you stepped on them! Yeah!

432
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,890
Okay, um...

433
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,190
Let's go to the water!

434
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,290
Yeah! Let's go!

435
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,090
Mococchi, don't drown! Hey!

436
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,890
I can swim! Run in slow-mo!

437
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,090
Oh, let's, let's just keep running on the beach.

438
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,590
Yeah!

439
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,490
I'm going to catch you, Nerissa!

440
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,590
You can't catch me!

441
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,890
Nerissa, wait!

442
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,090
I got you!

443
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,490
Calming up, put this thing down, okay?

444
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,290
Oh, my arm's getting tired.

445
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,290
Selfie arm tired.

446
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,490
Yeah, selfie arm's losing it.

447
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,090
Thank you for being such a tall person.

448
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,090
Yeah, of course.

449
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,090
Oh my god, it's Pokey!

450
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:50,290
Hey now! Save the beach party for later!

451
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,890
Sandcastles later, survival now!

452
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:56,090
They already detected your dimension jump.

453
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,490
I thought we were supposed to be safe here.

454
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,690
Yeah!

455
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,090
What's the big deal? Can't we have swimsuits and enjoy our time?

456
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,090
This is Justice we're dealing with! Expect the unexpected!

457
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,290
What should we do next then?

458
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,890
Do we have to run forever?

459
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,590
Don't panic, I have a plan.

460
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,490
Prove your bonds in the next trial, and I may assist you.

461
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,590
The power of friendship?

462
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,890
Nakama power?

463
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,390
Well, since this is a beach episode...

464
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:28,090
Beach episode! Beach episode! Beach episode! Yeah!

465
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,290
Good. Something's been arranged.

466
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,890
Look down! A & B!

467
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,490
A and B?

468
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,490
Not this again!

469
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,390
Are you serious?

470
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,890
A was A!

471
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,490
That's so lame!

472
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,490
A! A! B! B!

473
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,490
C-Can it! Silence!

474
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,090
To confirm your bonds, you'll take on "Master of Advent."

475
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,590
Master of Advent / Adventわかりて
Master of Advent / Advent Know-it-all

476
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,090
Master of Advent! What's that? Huh?

477
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,890
The rules are simple!

478
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,390
Each participant will be asked a two-option question related to Advent.

479
00:28:53,590 --> 00:29:01,090
You guys are Team Tomodachi, so it should be pretty easy, right...?

480
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,090
Exactly. But incorrect answers mean... your bonds are weak,

481
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,590
so I prepared a penalty game!

482
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,090
Penalty game! Penalty game!

483
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,390
I didn't consent to this.

484
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,590
Yeah, a penalty game.

485
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,290
Now, goth girl, take over.

486
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,290
Each player asks a two-choice question!

487
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,290
Get it wrong, and face a mysterious penalty!

488
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:19,590
Anyway, I think that we're going to get

489
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,090
one question, two answers, but only one is right.

490
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,590
And if you get it wrong, unfortunately,

491
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,290
I think you're going to get muddied.

492
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,590
Muddied? Not my new swimsuit!

493
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,290
Yeah, I don't want to get muddy in this thing.

494
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,290
Absolutely not!

495
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:40,090
So when you make your answer, I want you to hop there, okay?

496
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,590
Hop hop hop hop!

497
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,290
I'll go first as an example. Okay?

498
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,590
Okay!

499
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,390
Number one!

500
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,590
Which would Shiori rather be?

501
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,090
Which would Shiori rather be?

502
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,090
A: A vampire, B: A werewolf

503
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,890
A vampire for A,

504
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,290
or a werewolf for B?

505
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,590
On the count of three, okay? Three, two, one, go!

506
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:00,090
Vampire!

507
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,090
Shiori!

508
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:06,090
Yeah!

509
00:30:06,113 --> 00:30:09,113
Which would Shiori rather be?
A: A vampire B: A werewolf

510
00:30:09,213 --> 00:30:11,213
I don't want to drink blood, what am I, stupid?

511
00:30:11,313 --> 00:30:12,613
Whoa, that's unexpected.

512
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:16,113
I seriously thought you were going to say vampire.

513
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:17,313
You got that dog in you?

514
00:30:17,513 --> 00:30:20,113
I literally have the dog in me, yeah.

515
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:49,613
Go! Go wash yourself!

516
00:30:50,313 --> 00:30:52,613
Oh god, what is it...?

517
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:57,613
You too, I'm watching you.

518
00:30:58,313 --> 00:31:01,313
Well, you got us all wet, Shiori, are you happy?

519
00:31:01,613 --> 00:31:03,213
Not yet.

520
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,613
All right, well, next one, how about Mococo?

521
00:31:07,113 --> 00:31:11,113
Moco-chan! My- my turn!

522
00:31:12,113 --> 00:31:15,213
Okay, well, here I go! Um, at the beach...

523
00:31:16,313 --> 00:31:27,913
Which would Mococo do at the beach?
A: Collect seashells B: Make sandcastles

524
00:31:16,313 --> 00:31:21,613
Would I rather collect seashells, A...

525
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:27,913
...or, um, how was it? Ah, make sandcastles, B?

526
00:31:29,113 --> 00:31:31,313
Okay, Biboo, ready?

527
00:31:32,613 --> 00:31:34,613
Okay, jump on three.

528
00:31:35,113 --> 00:31:37,113
Three, two, one!

529
00:31:42,313 --> 00:31:44,113
I can't remember!

530
00:31:44,313 --> 00:31:46,613
This was seashells and this was sandcastles.

531
00:31:46,913 --> 00:31:49,113
Wait, you chose this way, Shiori?

532
00:31:50,313 --> 00:31:53,113
No, I thought you wanted this one!

533
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,613
I- I made a mistake!

534
00:31:56,713 --> 00:32:00,113
I'd rather collect seashells, but I jumped this
way, so that means this way is right!

535
00:32:09,313 --> 00:32:10,613
This is so unfair!

536
00:32:11,113 --> 00:32:13,613
Moco-chan won! No!

537
00:32:14,313 --> 00:32:17,313
Help me! Biboo! Biboo!

538
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:30,613
Shiori, see you for now.

539
00:32:30,913 --> 00:32:32,613
Yeah, for now, for now! Bau bau!

540
00:32:34,313 --> 00:32:36,313
Okay, have fun!

541
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:39,613
That is so mean!

542
00:32:40,613 --> 00:32:42,213
Seriously!

543
00:32:42,913 --> 00:32:45,313
It was a game of chance! How about Fuwawa next?

544
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,613
Okay! It's my turn!

545
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:52,113
I don't get to get dirty this time, right? Yeah.

546
00:32:53,313 --> 00:32:55,113
Okay, my question!

547
00:32:55,613 --> 00:33:06,113
Which does Fuwawa prefer?
A: Long-haired cats B: Short-haired cats

548
00:32:55,913 --> 00:32:57,313
Do I prefer...

549
00:32:57,613 --> 00:33:01,613
...long-haired cats or short-haired cats?

550
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,113
Okay, I'm the fluffy one! Bau bau! Here we go!

551
00:33:06,613 --> 00:33:08,613
Three, two, one!

552
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:10,613
No way!

553
00:33:11,313 --> 00:33:15,613
What, really? You prefer short hair? You're the
fluffy one!

554
00:33:16,313 --> 00:33:19,313
It's too easy! It's a trick question! It's so
obvious!

555
00:33:19,613 --> 00:33:22,613
Oh, you're so mean to me!

556
00:33:23,613 --> 00:33:28,113
You deserve it! Oh, you're so terrible!

557
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:36,313
Think before! Ah, think about it!

558
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,613
Ah, that feels nice! Yeah!

559
00:33:45,713 --> 00:33:47,113
Well, it's going to be your turn next!

560
00:33:47,613 --> 00:33:49,613
Oh, Bijou? Biboo-san, come back!

561
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:54,613
I don't- I don't want to play this game anymore!
It's so dynamic!

562
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:58,613
Okay! Okay, is it Biboo's turn now?

563
00:33:58,713 --> 00:34:01,313
It's Biboo's turn now. Okay.

564
00:34:02,313 --> 00:34:06,113
My question is, ooh, okay. Would I rather fight...

565
00:34:04,313 --> 00:34:21,113
Which would Bijou fight?
A: One hundred chicken-sized hippopotamuses
B: One hippopotamus-sized chicken

566
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:12,113
...one hundred chicken-sized hippopotamuses on A...

567
00:34:12,913 --> 00:34:19,113
...or one hippopotamus-sized chicken on B? Do
you understand?

568
00:34:20,313 --> 00:34:22,313
I understand! Okay, okay!

569
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:24,613
Jump! Okay.

570
00:34:24,913 --> 00:34:29,613
One hundred... one hundred chicken-sized hippos...

571
00:34:30,613 --> 00:34:34,613
...or one hippopotamus-sized chicken? I'm not
repeating it.

572
00:34:35,613 --> 00:34:38,113
Oh, this is such a good one! Okay!

573
00:34:38,913 --> 00:34:41,113
Ready! And...

574
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:44,313
...three, two, one! Ha!

575
00:34:51,113 --> 00:34:54,113
Biboo! Biboo doesn't like adds, Biboo likes boss
battles! You should have known!

576
00:34:54,913 --> 00:34:57,613
It's a boss battle! One! That's it!

577
00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:02,613
I- I don't know the question! I just thought 100
was bad!

578
00:35:03,313 --> 00:35:05,613
Ah, unfortunately for you!

579
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:07,437
Here she comes!

580
00:35:07,437 --> 00:35:08,137
Here she comes!

581
00:35:08,137 --> 00:35:09,237
It's gonna be nasty!

582
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:10,337
Wait, see, see!

583
00:35:10,337 --> 00:35:11,637
You have, you have one chance!

584
00:35:11,637 --> 00:35:13,237
Ask for mercy!

585
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,237
Don't leave me!

586
00:35:15,237 --> 00:35:16,637
Get some!

587
00:35:19,337 --> 00:35:21,137
I told you!

588
00:35:21,937 --> 00:35:23,537
No!

589
00:35:23,737 --> 00:35:25,537
Don't leave me like this!

590
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:27,137
Don't leave me, okay?! No!

591
00:35:28,637 --> 00:35:30,537
I'm going to the water!

592
00:35:30,537 --> 00:35:32,637
Goodbye! I'm going to the water!

593
00:35:32,637 --> 00:35:33,837
Goodbye! Goodbye!

594
00:35:34,237 --> 00:35:35,337
Your turn now!

595
00:35:35,437 --> 00:35:36,637
She became a mermaid.

596
00:35:36,837 --> 00:35:38,237
She's swimming away.

597
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:40,037
We'll never see her again.

598
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:42,637
No, come back to us, Mococo-chan! Come back!

599
00:35:42,637 --> 00:35:44,337
Mococo-chan, we need you!

600
00:35:44,337 --> 00:35:46,637
I am my darkness now.

601
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,137
Bye-bye.

602
00:35:49,237 --> 00:35:50,937
Bye-bye, my lady.

603
00:35:51,437 --> 00:35:52,537
Last is my turn.

604
00:35:52,537 --> 00:35:54,637
Means I can't get it wrong, which is pretty, feels pretty good.

605
00:35:55,937 --> 00:35:58,537
Um, what's a good question? I'm not really sure.

606
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:01,337
Um, let's see.

607
00:36:01,437 --> 00:36:05,337
Nerissa is a demon, but she's also half raven.

608
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:11,237
If I had to pick between worlds and either be just a demon or just a raven...

609
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,537
So demon is B.

610
00:36:13,537 --> 00:36:14,637
Raven is A.

611
00:36:14,637 --> 00:36:16,937
Which would I pick?

612
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:19,637
All right. Yes. Okay.

613
00:36:20,437 --> 00:36:21,437
On three, okay?

614
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,537
One...

615
00:36:22,937 --> 00:36:23,737
Two...

616
00:36:24,237 --> 00:36:25,437
Three!

617
00:36:30,537 --> 00:36:33,037
I knew you'd never give up being A!

618
00:36:33,037 --> 00:36:34,137
I'm right!

619
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:35,337
I can't be A!

620
00:36:35,437 --> 00:36:36,937
Yes, you can! You're stinky!

621
00:36:36,937 --> 00:36:38,237
That's not fair!

622
00:36:38,537 --> 00:36:39,537
I'm stinky!

623
00:36:40,137 --> 00:36:42,637
I just think it would be great if I could have powers that aren't dependent on...

624
00:36:42,637 --> 00:36:43,537
Well, we're in this together at least.

625
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:44,337
Yeah, yeah.

626
00:36:44,437 --> 00:36:46,137
Something that can break, you know?

627
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,237
I thought being a demon is cooler though.

628
00:36:48,237 --> 00:36:48,837
It is.

629
00:36:48,837 --> 00:36:50,937
But wait, demons are friends from the underworld.

630
00:36:50,937 --> 00:36:53,437
You know what's even cooler than being a demon, Shiori and Mococo?

631
00:36:57,437 --> 00:36:58,537
What? I dare you!

632
00:36:58,637 --> 00:36:59,537
Yeah? I dare you!

633
00:36:59,637 --> 00:37:01,137
You've been very bad!

634
00:37:01,237 --> 00:37:02,937
I dare you!

635
00:37:05,337 --> 00:37:07,437
Yeah! There you go!

636
00:37:07,637 --> 00:37:09,637
Mococo-chan, get you!

637
00:37:10,737 --> 00:37:12,637
Yeah, you want Mococo-chan?

638
00:37:13,537 --> 00:37:15,237
I like baths, okay?

639
00:37:15,237 --> 00:37:16,637
Yeah, you like that?

640
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:19,237
Well, you like it so much, go take one in the ocean!

641
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,437
Go to the ocean!

642
00:37:20,537 --> 00:37:21,937
The ocean you want!

643
00:37:22,137 --> 00:37:23,037
Go!

644
00:37:23,137 --> 00:37:24,037
Go!

645
00:37:24,237 --> 00:37:25,037
Go!

646
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,137
Don't leave me like this!

647
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,237
Well, we'll never see them again.

648
00:37:29,637 --> 00:37:30,537
Uh-oh.

649
00:37:30,637 --> 00:37:32,637
They're getting lost in the water.

650
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:34,637
I think they're having too much fun.

651
00:37:34,637 --> 00:37:35,737
Dripping up the sea!

652
00:37:35,737 --> 00:37:36,537
But it's fine.

653
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:38,037
Don't eat the salt water.

654
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:39,537
Yeah, don't drink the water.

655
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:43,137
Glug glug glug. I'm sipping up the sea. Glug glug glug.

656
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:49,137
I'm, I'm gonna get rid of this.

657
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:51,137
That was fun.

658
00:37:56,137 --> 00:37:58,637
Hey hey hey hey hey!

659
00:37:58,637 --> 00:38:03,137
That didn't go so well, huh?
Look how dirty you are!

660
00:38:03,137 --> 00:38:06,137
But hey, idols don't give up that easy, right?

661
00:38:06,237 --> 00:38:12,137
You are idols, right?
Let's turn this around and shine again!

662
00:38:10,637 --> 00:38:12,637
Wait, are we still idols after being soiled?

663
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:14,637
We weren't soiled!

664
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:19,137
And if you do...
I'll take you somewhere super special—

665
00:38:14,637 --> 00:38:16,137
Don't soil me!

666
00:38:16,937 --> 00:38:19,137
Oh! No way!

667
00:38:19,237 --> 00:38:22,637
—where even Justice can't find us!

668
00:38:20,637 --> 00:38:21,637
Where's that?

669
00:38:23,437 --> 00:38:25,537
Another adventure!

670
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:26,637
I'm interested!

671
00:38:27,537 --> 00:38:30,137
I want Justice to find me at some point.

672
00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:31,137
Wait, what?

673
00:38:31,637 --> 00:38:33,637
We'll be safe, but you can go.

674
00:38:33,637 --> 00:38:36,137
Okay, just for now! Just for now!

675
00:38:36,237 --> 00:38:38,137
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

676
00:38:38,237 --> 00:38:39,537
Let's go!

677
00:38:48,637 --> 00:38:51,437
ドンドコソコ アソコ 見つからないぜ
Don-doko soko asoko, can't be found!

678
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:54,137
パパイヤ マンゴー ココナツ
Papaya, mango, coconut!

679
00:38:54,437 --> 00:38:56,637
かき氷 いちご味
Shaved ice, strawberry flavor...

680
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:59,137
べろを出したら まっかっか
When I stick my tongue out, it's bright red!

681
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,837
Ai! 写真ざんす 水着 SHOW SAY!
Ai! Time for photos, swimsuit SHOW SAY!

682
00:39:02,037 --> 00:39:04,937

Ja-ja-ja-ja-ja-ja-jaan!

683
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:06,737

684
00:39:06,737 --> 00:39:09,237
カチカチに燃えてるお日様
The sun is burning intensely!

688
00:39:17,237 --> 00:39:19,637

00:46:38,871 --> 00:46:43,039
See those two giant faces? Their face parts are all scattered around.

855
00:46:43,996 --> 00:46:45,039
Oh...

856
00:46:44,621 --> 00:46:45,580
I see.

857
00:46:45,121 --> 00:46:46,080
I see.

858
00:46:45,705 --> 00:46:46,621
I see.

859
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:47,246
Yeah.

860
00:46:47,663 --> 00:46:50,080
Bijou and Shiori will be blindfolded and carry the face parts!

861
00:46:50,288 --> 00:46:51,496
Blindfold?

862
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:52,496
Oh, nice!

863
00:46:52,538 --> 00:46:54,538
Oh, yeah, actually that sounds like fun.

864
00:46:54,663 --> 00:46:56,455
Huh. We don't have to do anything.

865
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,913
Big bird, with your words alone, you must guide them.

866
00:46:59,371 --> 00:47:00,788
Lead them to place each piece...

867
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,496
...and restore FUWAMOCO's face!

868
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:05,621
Me?

869
00:47:05,705 --> 00:47:06,538
Yeah, you.

870
00:47:06,955 --> 00:47:09,330
Oh, well, we're just gonna be over here blindfolded.

871
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:10,788
Yeah, we're just gonna chill.

872
00:47:10,496 --> 00:47:11,413
Good luck.

873
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:12,538
Okay, I'll do my best.

874
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,663
No pressure.

875
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,121
No pressure.

876
00:47:14,413 --> 00:47:15,496
I believe in you.

877
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,330
You've got 5 minutes. Better make it count!

878
00:47:18,788 --> 00:47:20,955
Okay, let's all say FUWAMOCO together.

879
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:22,580
BAU BAU!

880
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,455
BAU BAU!

881
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:23,955
BAU BAU!

882
00:47:23,746 --> 00:47:24,996
Let's do this!

883
00:47:24,621 --> 00:47:25,705
Let's go!

884
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:27,705
Let's go!

885
00:47:28,371 --> 00:47:30,080
All right, ladies.

886
00:47:29,621 --> 00:47:30,788
So first plan of action...

887
00:47:30,663 --> 00:47:33,621
...come on over, one on each side of me, pretty please.

888
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:34,288
Okay.

889
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:35,538
And then I would like you to turn around.

890
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:36,663
Oh, okay.

891
00:47:37,538 --> 00:47:39,330
So, I have prepared for you...

892
00:47:39,246 --> 00:47:40,288
...blindfolds.

893
00:47:40,163 --> 00:47:41,455
So I'm gonna go ahead and just—

894
00:47:41,455 --> 00:47:44,121
—you can feel free to adjust them as you like.

895
00:47:44,496 --> 00:47:45,580
But, uh...

896
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:46,663
...that way...

897
00:47:46,621 --> 00:47:48,538
...you won't be able to see anything since I have to direct you.

898
00:47:48,996 --> 00:47:50,788
So go ahead and turn back around.

899
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,955
I cannot see a thing.

900
00:47:56,163 --> 00:47:57,580
Yes, perfect, that's exactly what we want.

901
00:47:57,705 --> 00:47:58,621
Aha.

902
00:47:59,955 --> 00:48:02,371
All right, and then, uh, we're gonna go ahead and start...

903
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:03,413
...placing these things.

904
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:04,455
So FUWAMOCO...

905
00:48:04,413 --> 00:48:05,371
...my puppies...

906
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,121
I'll do my best for you, okay?

907
00:48:07,205 --> 00:48:08,371
Do your best!

908
00:48:07,955 --> 00:48:08,996
Oh, you're so—

909
00:48:08,705 --> 00:48:09,830
Let's do this!

910
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:10,330
Oh, my!

911
00:48:09,788 --> 00:48:10,788
I love—let's do this!

912
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:11,455
Let's do it!

913
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:12,039
Let's do it!

914
00:48:13,496 --> 00:48:14,538
Okay...

915
00:48:14,496 --> 00:48:15,455
...and start!

916
00:48:17,496 --> 00:48:19,663
So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hand you guys each a piece...

917
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:21,288
...and then I'm gonna tell you where to go.

918
00:48:23,621 --> 00:48:24,621
Who goes first then?

919
00:48:25,246 --> 00:48:26,996
So you're each gonna do one face.

920
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:28,288
Okay.

921
00:48:27,996 --> 00:48:28,913
Okay.

922
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:30,496
Uh, you're gonna start that way.

923
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:31,621
Wait, what?

924
00:48:31,455 --> 00:48:32,621
Wait, what's happening?

925
00:48:32,455 --> 00:48:33,455
Where am I?

926
00:48:33,371 --> 00:48:34,413
What's this?

927
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:35,663
Shiori's just grabbing.

928
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,205
I don't know what to grab.

929
00:48:37,788 --> 00:48:38,788
—let's grab.

930
00:48:40,163 --> 00:48:41,413
Shiori, walk to me.

931
00:48:41,288 --> 00:48:42,788
My paws are a bit little.

932
00:48:42,413 --> 00:48:43,996
This is very small.

933
00:48:43,996 --> 00:48:45,580
No! Yeah, yes, this way.

934
00:48:45,496 --> 00:48:46,621
This way.

935
00:48:46,538 --> 00:48:47,663
Come towards me.

936
00:48:48,371 --> 00:48:50,330
If I accidentally grab something, I'm sorry.

937
00:48:51,288 --> 00:48:52,496
Grab onto...

938
00:48:52,455 --> 00:48:53,538
this.

939
00:48:53,496 --> 00:48:54,496
This.

940
00:48:54,455 --> 00:48:55,538
This.

941
00:48:55,455 --> 00:48:56,455
Yes.

942
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:57,039
Yes.

943
00:48:56,538 --> 00:48:57,496
Okay, don't move.

944
00:48:57,413 --> 00:48:58,413
Okay.

945
00:48:58,121 --> 00:48:59,039
Don't move!

946
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,413
Uh, Biboo...

947
00:49:01,288 --> 00:49:03,413
...I want you to walk to the sound of my voice, okay?

948
00:49:04,371 --> 00:49:05,621
Where is the sound of your voice?

949
00:49:05,663 --> 00:49:07,621
Just follow the sound of my voice.

950
00:49:08,663 --> 00:49:09,788
—to your right.

951
00:49:09,705 --> 00:49:10,746
Your right.

952
00:49:10,663 --> 00:49:11,663
Where is he?

953
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,955
Okay, just a little right.

954
00:49:12,913 --> 00:49:14,080
Okay, forward.

955
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:15,746
Quickly!

956
00:49:15,663 --> 00:49:17,039
Forward.

957
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:18,246
Okay, now come to me.

958
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,371
Where is "you"?

959
00:49:23,413 --> 00:49:24,621
I want you to grab this.

960
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,746
Oh, okay.

961
00:49:25,621 --> 00:49:26,621
I got it.

962
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,080
Yes.

963
00:49:27,163 --> 00:49:29,163
So pretty much where you are right now...

964
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,330
...uh, not you, Shiori.

965
00:49:30,288 --> 00:49:31,955
Okay, Shiori, come forward a little bit.

966
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:33,621
This forward?

967
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,621
Or this forward?

968
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:35,538
The forward towards me.

969
00:49:35,496 --> 00:49:36,621
This forward.

970
00:49:36,621 --> 00:49:37,580
Yeah.

971
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:37,996
Yeah!

972
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,746
Okay, that's too much.

973
00:49:38,663 --> 00:49:39,955
Back up just a little bit.

974
00:49:41,371 --> 00:49:42,705
You're out of time!

975
00:49:42,121 --> 00:49:43,580
And then I want you to move...

976
00:49:44,246 --> 00:49:45,288
your- your right.

977
00:49:45,205 --> 00:49:46,205
Your right.

978
00:49:45,705 --> 00:49:46,746
Right!

979
00:49:46,496 --> 00:49:47,455
This is right.

980
00:49:47,121 --> 00:49:48,080
Right.

981
00:49:47,538 --> 00:49:48,538
Left!

982
00:49:48,371 --> 00:49:49,330
Left!

983
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:50,121
Okay, back up.

984
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,330
FUWAMOCO-chan!

985
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:53,580
I don't know if this is gonna work out!

986
00:49:53,413 --> 00:49:54,371
Place it down.

987
00:49:54,163 --> 00:49:55,913
My legs are so strong...

988
00:49:55,788 --> 00:49:56,913
...but now I'm regretting that.

989
00:49:57,371 --> 00:49:58,538
Place it down, Biboo.

990
00:49:58,413 --> 00:49:59,371
Oh, down?

991
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,205
Oh, okay.

992
00:50:00,522 --> 00:50:01,522
Okay, forward a little bit.

993
00:50:01,522 --> 00:50:02,222
Forward?

994
00:50:02,322 --> 00:50:03,722
Okay, and then can you straighten it out?

995
00:50:03,722 --> 00:50:04,622
Like this?

996
00:50:04,622 --> 00:50:06,622
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just a little bit more.

997
00:50:06,622 --> 00:50:07,622
Like this?

998
00:50:07,622 --> 00:50:10,122
Okay, yeah, and then can you just scoot
the whole thing over to...

999
00:50:10,222 --> 00:50:12,022
Scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot...

1000
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:13,022
...the right. No, left.

1001
00:50:13,422 --> 00:50:14,822
What about me? Should I do the same?

1002
00:50:15,222 --> 00:50:16,822
No, other way!

1003
00:50:18,722 --> 00:50:19,722
What are you doing?

1004
00:50:20,422 --> 00:50:22,522
Okay. Next items, next items.

1005
00:50:23,722 --> 00:50:24,922
Stay right where you are.

1006
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:26,722
Stay right where you are?

1007
00:50:26,722 --> 00:50:27,422
I am here.

1008
00:50:27,422 --> 00:50:28,622
I am here too, okay.

1009
00:50:29,222 --> 00:50:30,222
I've got two.

1010
00:50:30,422 --> 00:50:32,622
Oh, I feel like this is a head.

1011
00:50:36,622 --> 00:50:39,322
I want you both... I want you
both to walk backwards, okay?

1012
00:50:41,422 --> 00:50:42,122
Okay.

1013
00:50:41,422 --> 00:50:42,122
Okay.

1014
00:50:43,222 --> 00:50:44,422
Maybe straighten out a little bit.

1015
00:50:44,422 --> 00:50:46,722
Whoa, that's definitely a cheek.

1016
00:50:47,122 --> 00:50:48,622
Okay, back. No, actually you're perfect, Shio.

1017
00:50:49,322 --> 00:50:51,022
Biboo, you better get running.

1018
00:50:51,122 --> 00:50:52,222
Place... place one down.

1019
00:50:52,222 --> 00:50:54,222
Which one of those? This one?

1020
00:50:54,222 --> 00:50:56,422
You're going too far! This way!

1021
00:50:58,422 --> 00:50:59,422
Wait, where am I going?

1022
00:50:59,422 --> 00:51:00,722
This one's okay, right?

1023
00:51:00,722 --> 00:51:02,222
No, move it over to the right.

1024
00:51:02,322 --> 00:51:05,122
I'm at my right! My right, my right!

1025
00:51:07,322 --> 00:51:08,522
Okay, place the other one.

1026
00:51:08,522 --> 00:51:12,522
I don't want to... I don't want to continue like this.

1027
00:51:12,522 --> 00:51:14,122
Trust me! This way!

1028
00:51:14,122 --> 00:51:14,822
This way?

1029
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:15,722
No, where I am.

1030
00:51:15,722 --> 00:51:18,022
Yes, I also have to be like this.

1031
00:51:19,322 --> 00:51:21,222
Okay, people. Yeah, come towards
the sound of my voice.

1032
00:51:21,222 --> 00:51:23,422
Where is the sound of your voice?!

1033
00:51:23,422 --> 00:51:26,722
Forward, forward, forward.

1034
00:51:28,222 --> 00:51:31,222
Okay, stop. Now come this way a little bit.
Turn... this way.

1035
00:51:31,222 --> 00:51:32,622
Do you hear where I am?

1036
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:33,322
Oh yes, yes.

1037
00:51:33,322 --> 00:51:35,122
Pretend... pretend you're in
a Nermars game, okay?

1038
00:51:35,222 --> 00:51:37,222
Oh yes, I heard. I felt your foot.

1039
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:38,222
Perfect. Okay, stop, stop, stop.

1040
00:51:38,422 --> 00:51:40,222
Okay, now I want you to turn a little bit this way.

1041
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,222
Which way? This is a lot of ways!

1042
00:51:42,222 --> 00:51:43,922
Rotate your body! Rotate!

1043
00:51:44,422 --> 00:51:47,122
And this is all wrong!

1044
00:51:47,722 --> 00:51:50,722
Okay, so now I want you to place the one
in your left hand down, okay? On the ground.

1045
00:51:51,322 --> 00:51:52,622
Like this?

1046
00:51:52,622 --> 00:51:54,822
Yeah, okay. Now I want you to walk
slightly in this direction. Just like crab walk.

1047
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,422
This is so hard!

1048
00:51:58,422 --> 00:51:59,622
See what ear I'm at?

1049
00:51:59,622 --> 00:52:00,222
Oh yes.

1050
00:52:00,222 --> 00:52:02,222
Like a Nermars game. Think of it
like a game, people.

1051
00:52:02,222 --> 00:52:03,222
Okay, I think so.

1052
00:52:03,322 --> 00:52:04,622
Place it down.

1053
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,122
Like this?!

1054
00:52:06,422 --> 00:52:08,722
Don't... stop! I'm doing my best!

1055
00:52:09,322 --> 00:52:10,422
Shiori, go to what...

1056
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:12,522
You have one minute. One more, okay?

1057
00:52:12,522 --> 00:52:13,422
Okay, I'm done.

1058
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:15,322
Now move to the other side. Yes, yes.

1059
00:52:15,322 --> 00:52:19,222
So, people. You are... walk this way.

1060
00:52:19,322 --> 00:52:20,722
Okay, walk this way.

1061
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,822
Okay, put it down. Right there.

1062
00:52:23,922 --> 00:52:24,622
Yeah!

1063
00:52:24,622 --> 00:52:26,522
Wait, no, that's wrong! Pick it back up!

1064
00:52:26,522 --> 00:52:27,322
Ahhh!

1065
00:52:27,322 --> 00:52:28,622
Walk... opposite side.

1066
00:52:28,622 --> 00:52:29,622
Opposite side?

1067
00:52:32,622 --> 00:52:37,222
Behind you! Move backwards, backwards, backwards,
backwards, backwards, backwards.

1068
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:38,422
Okay, down!

1069
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:40,622
At least my face looks a bit better
than yours, Shio.

1070
00:52:40,622 --> 00:52:41,722
Now walk this way.

1071
00:52:41,722 --> 00:52:42,722
Which is... this way?

1072
00:52:43,522 --> 00:52:45,522
Yeah, yeah. Now walk to your left.

1073
00:52:46,422 --> 00:52:47,522
30 seconds!

1074
00:52:47,522 --> 00:52:49,722
No, no. Sorry, right. I think
you messed up, Shio.

1075
00:52:49,722 --> 00:52:50,222
Sorry! Sorry!

1076
00:52:50,222 --> 00:52:52,722
This way! Left, left, left! This way!
Yes! Okay, now forward.

1077
00:52:53,522 --> 00:52:54,822
Everything is going so slow.

1078
00:52:54,822 --> 00:52:58,722
Forward. Yes. Now put it down.
So good. Yeah, and the last one, please.

1079
00:53:00,822 --> 00:53:03,222
Okay. 15 seconds left! Are you done?

1080
00:53:03,522 --> 00:53:06,722
And... make it work! Make it work, my brain!

1081
00:53:07,922 --> 00:53:10,122
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 15 seconds.
Don't worry about it, don't worry about it.

1082
00:53:10,722 --> 00:53:11,922
Okay. Are we done?

1083
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:12,922
Yeah!

1084
00:53:17,722 --> 00:53:22,222
Okay, I want you guys to turn on around and we're going
to take off your blindfolds so you can see how you did, okay?

1085
00:53:22,522 --> 00:53:23,322
Wait, which one's around?

1086
00:53:23,322 --> 00:53:24,322
This way.

1087
00:53:24,322 --> 00:53:25,122
This way?

1088
00:53:32,322 --> 00:53:33,622
Well, let's take a look.

1089
00:53:34,422 --> 00:53:35,622
I bet we did great.

1090
00:53:35,722 --> 00:53:37,222
Never thought to look at you.

1091
00:53:41,222 --> 00:53:43,222
Mococo, what do you think? Isn't it good?

1092
00:53:43,622 --> 00:53:47,722
Hey, Bijou, Shiori! You sure this is Fuwawa and Mococo?

1093
00:53:44,422 --> 00:53:46,222
Yeah, look at it.

1094
00:53:48,522 --> 00:53:51,722
Something seems a little... off.

1095
00:53:53,822 --> 00:53:56,722
Nah, nah, nah. It looks great!

1096
00:53:57,622 --> 00:54:01,222
Yeah, it's not like it's upside down or anything.

1097
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,322
Seriously, can we have a look down?
I think it looks perfect.

1098
00:54:05,422 --> 00:54:07,722
Why are you looking at... I'm not seeing any better.

1099
00:54:07,722 --> 00:54:09,722
You're not making it better!

1100
00:54:13,522 --> 00:54:16,722
It's perfect! It's perfect!

1101
00:54:17,322 --> 00:54:20,222
Wait, wait, wait. What if I put this over here?

1102
00:54:20,322 --> 00:54:22,022
I want to put it there.

1103
00:54:22,222 --> 00:54:23,522
Don't touch my face!

1104
00:54:23,522 --> 00:54:26,022
Put it on the eye. Yeah! Great!

1105
00:54:29,322 --> 00:54:31,222
Everything is great!

1106
00:54:31,322 --> 00:54:40,222
I like the decision, you see, to... to do it like this,
because I just wanted to see what it would look like just a little lower.

1107
00:54:40,622 --> 00:54:41,522
This is not good.

1108
00:54:41,522 --> 00:54:45,522
Well, it's good enough to get changed back, Pokey!

1109
00:54:45,622 --> 00:54:47,922
Hmph, fine. I'll change them back!

1110
00:54:47,922 --> 00:54:50,222
Yay! Bau bau!

1111
00:54:51,222 --> 00:54:53,222
We can't be FuwaMoco anymore!

1112
00:54:55,522 --> 00:54:58,422
Hah! Hah! Yeah!

1113
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,240
Yeah! We did it!

1114
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,740
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1115
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,040
You didn't make my dream come true.

1116
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,240
That's not good, no no no no no!

1117
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,740
It's okay, I like you better this way.

1118
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:22,240
This is not on the face!

1119
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,040
I'm really glad we could get through this together. Aren't you guys?

1120
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,040
Yeah!

1121
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,740
The power of friendship!

1122
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:40,040
As Advent, you've gotta keep working together and looking out for one another!

1123
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:59,240
Yeah, that's karma. Yeah, get down.

1124
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,040
Howl!

1125
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,740
Checkmate, I'm a superstar. Stay insane, but you rock with it, uh.

1126
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,740
Yeah, like 24/7 I'm a hot mess ya love-hate.

1129
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:15,040
Like a villainess, villainous, bring home the jackpot.

1130
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,640
勇者も悪役も変わらない
Both heroes and villains are the same

But ya ya ya!

Life's just a tightrope, why not stop to fool around?

1134
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,040
“Chaotic good” is peak right now. I can show ya how.

1135
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,240
But ya ya ya!

1136
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:34,040
Don't get confused, we are not the same. I'm a ruthless dame.

1137
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,440
No way, no way, yeah, way oh way, yeah.

1138
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:41,040
“Good vs Evil” is so overdone.

1139
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,540
Let's all kick back and party. Just leave it to me.

1140
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,240

“Good vs Evil”, but I'm which one?

1161
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:01,040
Just stuck here in the middle. That's not any fun.

Places, places! Okay! Places!

Okay.

1200
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:38,148
Locked away where nightmares keep you awake,

1201
01:00:38,148 --> 01:00:42,380
You'll be safe within my crushing embrace

1202

You'll never escape...

1204
01:00:47,713 --> 01:00:50,208
(You're all mine, all mine!)

1205
01:00:51,858 --> 01:00:54,658
Wayward soul, I'll wrap you up

1206
01:00:54,658 --> 01:00:58,180
in darkness that consumes you whole,

1207
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:00,929
hold you in my labyrinth of walls

1208
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:05,713
(Lost in the depths that swallow you, where just your shadows follow you)

1209
01:01:05,758 --> 01:01:07,714
Always churning in the deep,

1210
01:01:07,714 --> 01:01:10,208
I won't let you sleep

1211
01:01:10,258 --> 01:01:14,602
You don't need your dreams now that you belong to me

1212
01:01:14,602 --> 01:01:16,713
Throw them all away,

1213
01:01:16,713 --> 01:01:19,148
you're too frail to be free

1214
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:21,691
You will always be

1215
01:01:21,691 --> 01:01:22,713
My lovely prisoner

1216
01:01:22,713 --> 01:01:24,079
Are you shaking?

1217
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:27,758
My eyes will find you, let me clutch you tightly

1218
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:30,148
(You can only be mine)

1219
01:01:30,148 --> 01:01:31,513
Poor little prisoner

1220
01:01:31,513 --> 01:01:32,702
Are you breaking?

1221
01:01:32,702 --> 01:01:36,825
My chains will bind you here forever,

1222
01:01:37,658 --> 01:01:40,013
Stay here for all time

1223
01:01:40,658 --> 01:01:42,380
in tenebris

1224
01:01:42,758 --> 01:01:44,491
in frigore

1225
01:01:44,858 --> 01:01:46,713
in carcere

1226
01:01:49,258 --> 01:01:51,713
Close your eyes, go deeper

1227
01:01:51,713 --> 01:01:55,380
in the emptiness that plagues your mind,

1228
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,825
let my dark envelop your light

1229
01:01:58,158 --> 01:02:00,569
I will keep you safe and sound,

1230
01:02:00,569 --> 01:02:03,013
Hear the blissful silence all around

1231
01:02:03,058 --> 01:02:05,380
I'll drag you down below,

1232
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:07,380
never let you go

1233
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:09,380
Everything you've been,

1234
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,013
the transgressions of your past,

1235
01:02:12,013 --> 01:02:13,936
Throw them all away,

1236
01:02:13,936 --> 01:02:15,602
let me hold you at last

1237
01:02:15,758 --> 01:02:17,691
My lovely prisoner

1238
01:02:17,691 --> 01:02:18,713
What's the matter?

1239
01:02:18,713 --> 01:02:23,208
You're never leaving, you are mine forever

1240
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:25,208
Got to keep you right here

1241
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:27,208
Poor, helpless prisoner

1242
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:28,380
Did you shatter?

1243
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:31,825
Why are you grieving your ambitions?

1244
01:02:32,358 --> 01:02:35,208
Let them disappear

1245
01:02:35,558 --> 01:02:39,148
I can hear your plea,

1246
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:43,936
reaching desperately,

1247
01:02:44,658 --> 01:02:51,713
but I'll never, ever set you free

1248
01:02:52,158 --> 01:02:54,380
Stay with me

1249
01:02:54,558 --> 01:02:56,491
My lovely prisoner

1250
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:57,380
Are you shaking?

1251
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:02,148
My eyes will find you, let me clutch you tightly

1252
01:03:02,358 --> 01:03:04,208
(You can only be mine)

1253
01:03:04,358 --> 01:03:06,208
Poor little prisoner

1254
01:03:06,358 --> 01:03:07,380
Are you breaking?

1255
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:11,148
My chains will bind you here forever,

1256
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:14,208
Stay here for all time

1257
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:16,148
in tenebris

1258
01:03:16,558 --> 01:03:18,380
in frigore

1259
01:03:18,558 --> 01:03:20,380
in carcere

1260
01:03:26,058 --> 01:03:28,358
Yeah! That was our new song,

1261
01:03:28,358 --> 01:03:31,208
Prisoner!

1262
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:33,713
What did you think of the track, huh?

1263
01:03:33,713 --> 01:03:36,208
Hot song, huh?

1264
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:39,825
Okay, and let's all move on to the second piece of

Yeah, we did!

1328
01:06:00,876 --> 01:06:03,476
Even though we were running from justice half the time.

1329
01:06:03,476 --> 01:06:05,376
Yeah, but that's a typical Friday!

1330
01:06:05,376 --> 01:06:07,176
Were we really worried?

1331
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:08,776
No! Better luck next time, Justice!

1332
01:06:08,776 --> 01:06:11,176
