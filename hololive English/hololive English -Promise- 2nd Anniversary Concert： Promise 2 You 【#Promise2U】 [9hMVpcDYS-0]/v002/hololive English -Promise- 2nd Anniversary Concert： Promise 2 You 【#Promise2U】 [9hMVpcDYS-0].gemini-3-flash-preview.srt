明日に怯えていたよ
I was afraid of tomorrow

7
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,500

誰かのために生きられるなら
If I can live for someone

00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,000
ひとりでは解けない愛のパズルを抱いて
Holding the puzzle of love that I can't solve alone

13
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,500
Get wild and tough

14
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,000
この街で優しさに甘えていたくはない
I don't want to rely on kindness in this town

Even if I act like it doesn't matter,

40

どこかで繋がっていて
we're connected somewhere.

41

00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:08,608
今を生きていたいんだ
like an electric shock.

なんてまだガキね
You're still such a kid

00:10:02,246 --> 00:10:03,156
本音は言わない
Never say what you're really thinking

69
00:10:03,156 --> 00:10:04,946
ほら悩ましい
Look, how distressing

70
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:08,096
甘い言葉かけるよりもずっと愛おしい
Far more lovely than just saying sweet words

71

堪らなくなるほど
So much it's becoming unbearable

72
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:14,396

この手掴んだ
I grabbed this hand

97
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,096
まだ未練があるのね
You still have regrets, don't you?

98
00:11:06,096 --> 00:11:08,446
あらまただわ
Oh, here we go again

99
00:11:08,446 --> 00:11:11,496
我がまま愛と名付けてまた支配する
Calling it love and ruling again

100
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:16,296
あなたに溺れてく
I'm drowning in you

101
00:11:16,296 --> 00:11:19,496
息苦しいくらいに
To the point it's suffocating

102
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:21,996
鎮静させられて
Being sedated

103
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:23,996

Dedication

109
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:35,596

Infatuation

113
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:43,296
躊躇いなど捨てて
Throw away your hesitation

114
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:43,996

べたにただ愛されたかっただけだったのよ私が
I just wanted to be loved in a cliché way

127
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:09,496
いらないそういう言葉は期待するだけ無駄だし
I don't need those words, it's a waste to just expect them

128
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,196
出してしまったシカクがわからないよね
You don't understand the "blind spot" I've put out, do you?

129

155
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:21,996
As our power grows

156
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:25,496
Tryin' to stop the show

157
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:29,496
Might as well go try

158
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:33,996
Stop time

159
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:54,996
So you know that

160
00:14:54,996 --> 00:14:57,496
We're out there

161
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,496
Swatting lies in the making

162
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:06,077
Life Will Change

163
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:03,177
Move fast without breaking

164
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:06,177
Can't hold on or life will change

165
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:10,227
And our voices ring out, yeah

166
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:13,877
Took the mask off to feel free

167
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:16,677
Fought it out in the debris

168
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:20,527
Now we know that life will change

169
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:55,077
And this time

170
00:15:55,077 --> 00:15:59,277
Another figment of your ailing old mind

171
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,877
I'm just as real as

172
00:16:02,877 --> 00:16:04,877
I'm just as dangerous

173
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:07,077
As you so know, you'll find

174
00:16:07,777 --> 00:16:09,877
A taste of your own meds

175
00:16:11,077 --> 00:16:13,377
Firing every breath

176
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:16,677
Fire inside your head

177
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:18,877
Your heart

178
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:24,177
And as your people pray

179
00:16:25,377 --> 00:16:27,577
Try so hard to evade

180
00:16:29,027 --> 00:16:31,577
Your empire of old

181
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:34,077
Of old

182
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:52,127
And you know we were out there

183
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:55,277
Swatting flies in the making

184
00:16:56,777 --> 00:16:59,277
Your empire for the taking

185
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:02,877
Can't hold on or life will change

186
00:17:04,527 --> 00:17:06,977
And our voices ring out there

187
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:10,327
Took the mask off to feel free

188
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:13,627
Fought it out in the debris

189
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:17,577
Now we know that life will change

190
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:26,077

横顔眺めているだけじゃ　無力そう
Just staring at your profile, I seem so helpless.

193
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:53,877
嘆いても　この背を誰も押さない
Even if I grieve, no one will push my back.

194
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:57,177
GOING OUT!

飛び方を忘れていた
Of the birds who forgot how to fly,

196
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:04,477
鳥達の嘆きのヴォイス

00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:08,227
凍てつく無機質な世界に　何を望むの？
What do you wish for in this frozen, inorganic world?

198
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:10,577
そうだけどね

00:19:10,577 --> 00:19:14,777
確実な希望がもう僕の中に
...a certain hope is already within me.

200
00:19:14,827 --> 00:19:18,227
GOING OUT!

201

何かできるかなんて
Whether I can do something,

202
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:25,377

I've started running; the beginning...

204

きっと生まれる前から決まっていた

205
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:35,577
羽を揺らし　強く地面を蹴って

君の元へ羽ばたこう
I'll fly to where you are.

運命(カルマ)の真下で
Directly beneath fate...

211
00:19:52,577 --> 00:19:55,877
僕にできることが　どんなに僅かでも

その身体に背負うもの
What you carry on that body,

213
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:02,377

Taking flight now

How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel?

588
00:45:27,512 --> 00:45:30,012
Oh, I wish I got a massage

589
00:45:30,012 --> 00:45:32,512
for my left side too, that would have been so nice.

590
00:45:33,012 --> 00:45:37,012
But you know, I'm so happy that we got to suffer together!

591
00:45:37,512 --> 00:45:41,012
Yay! Yay!

592
00:45:41,512 --> 00:45:44,012

Yeah, let's get back to the live—

594
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:49,512
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! No!

595
00:45:50,012 --> 00:45:53,012
Actually, yeah, let's get back to the live! No! No!

596
00:45:53,012 --> 00:45:56,012
We should get back to the live! Yeah, I think it's time!

597
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:59,512
It's time for the punishment game!

598
00:46:00,012 --> 00:46:03,512
Staff-san, please prepare! Thank you, thank you!

599
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:06,512
Okay, so they said it was like a super sour drink.

600
00:46:06,512 --> 00:46:09,512
Yeah, I heard it's a sour drink.

601
00:46:09,512 --> 00:46:12,012
Why is it—? It smells— It smells healthy.

602
00:46:12,012 --> 00:46:13,012
Oh wait, it smells good though.

603
00:46:13,012 --> 00:46:15,012
It smells like ass.

604
00:46:15,012 --> 00:46:18,012
Mmm... It's like... Ume? Maybe? Is it Ume? It smells Ume-y.

605
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:20,012
Yeah, it smells Ume-y.

606
00:46:20,012 --> 00:46:22,012
なんか... 薬臭くないちょっと。
Wait, doesn't it smell a bit like medicine?

607
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:24,012
じゃ、不健康の二人で。
Then, for the two unhealthy ones.

608
00:46:24,012 --> 00:46:25,512
Sabotaged!

609
00:46:25,512 --> 00:46:27,512
Cheers!

610
00:46:38,512 --> 00:46:39,512
That sounds wonderful!

611
00:46:39,712 --> 00:46:41,012
酸っめぇ！
So sour!

612
00:46:41,012 --> 00:46:43,012
That's actually really good.

613
00:46:43,012 --> 00:46:44,012
Really?

614
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:45,012
Wow.

615
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,012
Are you good?

616
00:46:48,712 --> 00:46:50,012
酸っぱ...
Sour...

617
00:46:50,512 --> 00:46:52,512
I think you're having a great time.

618
00:46:52,512 --> 00:46:55,012
Well, it tastes better after a bit more time.

619
00:46:57,012 --> 00:46:59,512
My face is turning into that lemon meme!

620
00:46:59,512 --> 00:47:02,012
You know that lemon face just implodes?

621
00:47:04,012 --> 00:47:06,012
薬っぽい味した。
It tasted like medicine.

622
00:47:07,012 --> 00:47:09,012
I feel so healthy. Probably healthy.

623
00:47:10,012 --> 00:47:14,012
That's it, guys! That's it! Whoo!

624
00:47:14,012 --> 00:47:18,512
Okay, so we're going to return to the live performance...

Whoo! Yeah! Let's go!

627
00:47:26,512 --> 00:47:29,012
All right, you guys are fine. Okay, let's get a move on.

628
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,512
Just, just, just get a move on.

629
00:47:32,012 --> 00:47:33,512
All right.

630
00:47:33,512 --> 00:47:35,012
Whoo! Yeah!

01:02:08,443 --> 01:02:12,843
It's the hololive English -Promise- 2nd Anniversary Celebration merch.

795
01:02:12,943 --> 01:02:16,843
We're releasing merchandise to commemorate our second anniversary.

796
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:20,843
Let's take turns introducing the merch, shall we?

797
01:02:20,943 --> 01:02:22,843
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

798
01:02:23,343 --> 01:02:50,343
Frame Art Board

799
01:02:23,443 --> 01:02:27,843
So first up is a Frame Art Board of our wonderful key visual for the Promise 2nd Anniversary.

800
01:02:27,943 --> 01:02:32,843
The frame part uses luxurious sparkling paper and the printed illustration turns this...

801
01:02:32,943 --> 01:02:38,843
...into a high-quality piece of art. Oh my! You definitely don't want to miss the chance...

802
01:02:38,943 --> 01:02:42,843
...to add it to your collection or room. And guess what?

803
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:45,843
You can even hang it on the wall!

804
01:02:45,943 --> 01:02:51,343
Oh my god, on the wall! On the wall!

805
01:02:51,443 --> 01:02:55,343
Next up are the Collection Cards for each of Promise.

806
01:02:54,343 --> 01:03:07,343
Collection Card

807
01:02:55,443 --> 01:03:00,343
These cards feature an attractive design with a foil-stamped on the front...

808
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:05,343
...and you can choose each card individually, so be sure to collect all of them!

809
01:03:05,443 --> 01:03:07,843
Gotta collect 'em all! Wow!

810
01:03:08,443 --> 01:03:11,843
Next, we also have Ring Necklaces! Yay!

811
01:03:09,343 --> 01:03:25,343
Ring Necklace

812
01:03:11,943 --> 01:03:16,843
This design includes cute references and motifs for each of us.

813
01:03:16,943 --> 01:03:22,343
You can use it as either a ring or a necklace, so feel free to change it up...

814
01:03:22,443 --> 01:03:25,843
...depending on the occasion!

815
01:03:25,943 --> 01:03:27,343
Yay! Next!

816
01:03:27,343 --> 01:03:44,343
Tumbler

817
01:03:27,443 --> 01:03:31,843
And next, we have special porcelain tumblers with our designs on them.

818
01:03:31,943 --> 01:03:36,343
It features our talent colors on top of a black base.

819
01:03:36,443 --> 01:03:40,343
They are designed to have a unified look, and I bet it'll look so cool...

820
01:03:40,443 --> 01:03:44,843
...if you use several of these tumblers together in like a drinking party or something!

821
01:03:44,943 --> 01:03:46,343
Yay! Okay, last one!

822
01:03:46,443 --> 01:03:49,343
And lastly, we have a 2-way tote bag.

823
01:03:47,343 --> 01:04:14,343
2-WAY Tote Bag

824
01:03:49,443 --> 01:03:55,343
It's a 2-way design that can be used as both a shoulder bag and a tote bag. Oh, that's actually really cool.

825
01:03:55,443 --> 01:04:00,343
It's even designed to be used as a carry-on bag too. Perfect for traveling and convenience.

826
01:04:00,443 --> 01:04:05,343
And to top it off, it has many pockets that will definitely be useful...

827
01:04:05,443 --> 01:04:10,843
...for storing small items like other merch!

828
01:04:10,943 --> 01:04:13,843
Pockets! Oh my god!

829
01:04:13,943 --> 01:04:18,843
Yes! And that concludes the Promise 2nd Anniversary merch introduction!

830
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,843
Yay! Please get it!

831
01:04:20,943 --> 01:04:23,343
よろしくお願いいたします！
Thank you for your support!

832
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:27,343
Yay! Please get it! よろしくお願いいたします！
Yay! Please get it! Thank you for your support!

833
01:04:27,843 --> 01:04:31,843
And with that, we're finally at the very last part.

834
01:04:31,943 --> 01:04:34,343
Sorry for keeping you guys waiting.

835
01:04:34,443 --> 01:04:38,843
We mentioned that there would be a special surprise or announcement earlier.

836
01:04:38,943 --> 01:04:41,843
Would you like to hear what it is?

837
01:04:41,943 --> 01:04:43,843
Yes!

838
01:04:43,943 --> 01:04:46,343
I wonder what it is.

839
01:04:46,443 --> 01:04:50,343
But before we announce it...

840
01:04:50,443 --> 01:04:53,343
...it's time for a stage change!

841
01:04:53,443 --> 01:05:04,343
Stage change! Whoa! Oh my god! We're floating! We're going up! No!

842
01:05:04,031 --> 01:05:05,331
Whoa!

843
01:05:05,331 --> 01:05:06,431
Wait, stop, stop, stop!

844
01:05:06,431 --> 01:05:08,231
Oh my god! No, IRyS is mine!

845
01:05:09,431 --> 01:05:12,531
Okay, we're good, we're good, we're good. Okay.

846
01:05:14,231 --> 01:05:16,731
I'm getting claustrophobic!

847
01:05:16,731 --> 01:05:18,331
I'm gonna be sick!

848
01:05:19,531 --> 01:05:21,331
Okay, it's open.

849
01:05:21,331 --> 01:05:22,531
I see the light.

850
01:05:22,831 --> 01:05:24,331
Oh my goodness.

851
01:05:24,331 --> 01:05:28,031
Okay. Nice. That's nice.

852
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,531
I feel fresh air.

853
01:05:31,131 --> 01:05:35,931
All righty. Well, ladies, it is time for our final announcement.

854
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:38,331
Final announcement?

855
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:42,831
We, Promise, have a new original song!

856
01:05:45,231 --> 01:05:50,331
Finally releasing, it's called Run Back 'Round.

857
01:05:50,331 --> 01:05:52,431
Run Back 'Round! Our first new song!

858
01:05:52,431 --> 01:05:54,031
Look at that!

859
01:05:54,031 --> 01:05:57,031
We worked really, really hard on this song,

860
01:05:57,031 --> 01:05:59,331
and it's really cool, really catchy.

861
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:03,031
It's quite different to, you know, a lot of the original songs

862
01:06:03,031 --> 01:06:04,031
that we as Promise have put out before.

863
01:06:04,031 --> 01:06:07,331
Yeah! We hope that you guys will listen to it a lot.

864
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:11,431
The chorus part is quite hype and honestly quite easy to remember,

865
01:06:11,431 --> 01:06:15,231
so I feel like, you know, hopefully it becomes an earworm

866
01:06:15,231 --> 01:06:17,031
and you can go put it on loop over and over and over again.

867
01:06:17,231 --> 01:06:18,331
That's our big reveal.

868
01:06:18,331 --> 01:06:19,831
Hope you're excited!

869
01:06:19,831 --> 01:06:22,931
I'm so excited! Yay!

870
01:06:23,431 --> 01:06:27,731
Well, I think all that's left is for us to perform our new song.

871
01:06:28,231 --> 01:06:31,331
What? We're gonna perform it here? Right here?

872
01:06:31,331 --> 01:06:35,031
Floating here in the city. Yeah! Floating here.

873
01:06:35,931 --> 01:06:40,131
But before we go, do you have any final thoughts about our live, about our anniversary?

874
01:06:40,531 --> 01:06:44,431
I am just super happy we got to do this as Promise,

875
01:06:44,431 --> 01:06:48,231
and you know, it was a lot of fun singing all these songs with you guys,

876
01:06:48,231 --> 01:06:54,031
you know, different duets, and I just really like the fact that we have a hideout now.

877
01:06:55,031 --> 01:06:58,131
We do! We finally have our hideout now!

878
01:06:58,131 --> 01:07:01,131
We have a bar too! For celebration!

879
01:07:01,831 --> 01:07:03,831
Catch you at the bar. Yeah.

880
01:07:03,831 --> 01:07:06,131
And it's in a fabulous location.

881
01:07:06,131 --> 01:07:09,131
Imagine how expensive the rent is. Yeah.

882
01:07:09,131 --> 01:07:12,731
Don't let them pay for it. We'll all pay for it. All good.

883
01:07:12,831 --> 01:07:15,431
So, yeah, I'm really happy. How about you guys?

884
01:07:16,131 --> 01:07:20,831
Yeah, I'm just really thankful that, you know, we're still here after two years,

885
01:07:20,831 --> 01:07:24,331
and you know, hope everyone continues to support Promise. Thank you guys.

886
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:27,731
And here's to many, many more! Yay!

887
01:07:30,731 --> 01:07:36,431
I could say the same thing. I'm just gonna steal everyone's and say that it's been great being with all of you for two years,

888
01:07:36,431 --> 01:07:40,831
and you know, now we get to have this cool hideout,

889
01:07:40,831 --> 01:07:48,231
and this awesome song that we get to show everyone. So, yay!

890
01:07:51,431 --> 01:07:52,531
We ready?

891
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:53,231
Yes.

892
01:07:53,231 --> 01:07:54,131
I'm ready.

893
01:07:54,131 --> 01:07:55,331
Let's go!

894
01:07:55,331 --> 01:07:57,331
Ready, set, go!

895
01:07:57,331 --> 01:08:01,631
Run Back 'Round!

896
01:08:11,831 --> 01:08:15,231
Run back 'round...

897
01:08:16,331 --> 01:08:19,531
Don't stop now...

898
01:08:19,531 --> 01:08:22,831
Run back 'round...

899
01:08:22,831 --> 01:08:26,231
Don't stop now...

900
01:08:27,731 --> 01:08:29,531
Up with the moonlight,

901
01:08:29,531 --> 01:08:31,731
Down in the streetlights,

902
01:08:31,731 --> 01:08:34,031
Looking for a spotlight,

903
01:08:34,031 --> 01:08:35,431
Making my move

904
01:08:35,431 --> 01:08:36,431
Whoa

905
01:08:36,431 --> 01:08:37,231
I'm running

906
01:08:37,231 --> 01:08:38,231
Whoa

907
01:08:38,231 --> 01:08:39,431
行こう (Ikou)
Let's go

908
01:08:42,931 --> 01:08:45,231
Days like a whirlwind,

909
01:08:45,231 --> 01:08:47,431
don't stop coming,

910
01:08:47,431 --> 01:08:49,531
Got me in a tailspin,

911
01:08:49,531 --> 01:08:50,831
What can I do?

912
01:08:50,831 --> 01:08:51,731
Whoa

913
01:08:51,731 --> 01:08:52,631
Keep running!

914
01:08:52,631 --> 01:08:53,631
Whoa

915
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,831
行こう (Ikou)
Let's go

916
01:08:57,631 --> 01:08:59,731
Lost and found,

917
01:08:59,731 --> 01:09:02,331
back to where I started,

918
01:09:02,331 --> 01:09:04,631
I won't stay down,

919
01:09:04,631 --> 01:09:06,131
trust me, I can do it!

920
01:09:06,131 --> 01:09:07,431
I live life loud,

921
01:09:07,431 --> 01:09:09,731
take it to the limit,

922
01:09:09,731 --> 01:09:11,831
So stand up proud,

923
01:09:11,831 --> 01:09:12,931
now I'm gonna sing it!

924
01:09:12,931 --> 01:09:14,531
Run back 'round,

925
01:09:14,531 --> 01:09:16,731
it's a new beginning,

926
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:18,931
I run back 'round,

927
01:09:18,931 --> 01:09:21,131
got to keep believing,

928
01:09:21,131 --> 01:09:23,431
I run back 'round,

929
01:09:23,431 --> 01:09:25,631
I know where I'm going,

930
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,831
I run back 'round,

931
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:29,031
nothing's gonna stop me now!

932
01:09:29,531 --> 01:09:31,731
Woah oh oh!

934
01:09:35,431 --> 01:09:38,031
Woah oh oh!

01:09:41,331 --> 01:09:44,031
I'm gonna run back 'round!

936
01:09:45,231 --> 01:09:47,431
Sparks on the pavement,

937
01:09:47,431 --> 01:09:48,931
dreams in the distance,

938
01:09:48,931 --> 01:09:51,131
Gotta be relentless,

939
01:09:51,131 --> 01:09:52,431
faster than sound

940
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:53,331
Whoa

01:09:53,331 --> 01:09:54,331
Keep running!

Lock it and load it, 僕らは explosive
Lock it and load it, we are explosive

946
01:10:18,345 --> 01:10:21,578
Swifter and lighter, 明日ももっと brighter
Swifter and lighter, tomorrow will be even brighter

947
01:10:21,745 --> 01:10:22,245
Oh yeah...

948
01:10:22,345 --> 01:10:25,278
Faster than lightning, about to get exciting

949
01:10:25,445 --> 01:10:29,112
Keep on running...

950
01:10:29,378 --> 01:10:32,878
Run back 'round, it's a new beginning

951
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:36,445
I run back 'round, got to keep believing

952
01:10:36,545 --> 01:10:39,945
I run back 'round, I know where I'm going

953
01:10:40,045 --> 01:10:43,045
Day and night I'm running, I run back 'round

954
01:10:43,145 --> 01:10:44,778
Nothing's gonna stop me now!

955
01:10:44,845 --> 01:10:47,445
Hoo... Woah, oh, oh!

01:10:47,512 --> 01:10:50,378
止められないよ!
Can't stop now!

957
01:10:50,478 --> 01:10:52,378
I'm gonna run back 'round!

958
01:10:52,478 --> 01:10:54,945
Woah, oh, oh!

959
01:10:55,045 --> 01:10:57,645
走って 走って 走って
Run, run, run

960
01:10:57,745 --> 01:10:59,612
I'm gonna run back 'round!

961
01:10:59,678 --> 01:11:01,412
Woah, oh, oh!

01:11:00,612 --> 01:11:02,212
始まるよ
It's beginning

963
01:11:01,578 --> 01:11:06,445
I'm coming around, I've got a dream just waiting now

964
01:11:06,545 --> 01:11:07,545
I'm gonna run back 'round!

965
01:11:07,645 --> 01:11:10,645
Woah, oh, oh!

01:11:13,178 --> 01:11:14,745
I'm gonna run back 'round!

968
01:11:14,845 --> 01:11:18,112
Woah, oh, oh!
