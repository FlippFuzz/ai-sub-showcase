Promise 2 You

3
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
アスファルト タイヤを切りつけながら
Slicing through the asphalt with my tires

4
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,500
暗闇走り抜ける
I drive through the darkness

5
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,500

明日に怯えていたよ
I was frightened of tomorrow

7
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,500

誰かのために生きられるなら
If I can live for someone else's sake

何も怖くはない
There is nothing to fear

11
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Get wild and tough

12
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
ひとりでは
Alone,

13
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,500
解けない愛のパズルを抱いて
Holding the unsolvable puzzle of love

14
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Get wild and tough

15
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,500

In this city,

16
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,500
やさしさに甘えていたくはない
I don't want to rely on kindness

17

Can find something somewhere to protect

ありきたりな僕の日々を
Destroy my mundane days,

24
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:20,708
壊してくれ
please.

25
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:25,108
異常なほどの刺激を
I was waiting for an extraordinary

26
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:28,108
待ち望んでいたんだな
stimulation, wasn't I?

27
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:31,908
ちょっとしたそんな冒険心は
That little sense of adventure

28
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:35,408
改札に吸い込まれて
was sucked into the ticket gate.

29
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:38,908
吐き出された辿り着いた
Spat out, I arrived in

30
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:41,608
雨降るこの街
this rainy city.

31
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:46,408
何も感じないまま
Feeling nothing as I go on,

32
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:49,608
死んでいくのはごめんだ
I refuse to just die like this.

33
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:54,108
終わりのその先を目指して
Aiming for what lies beyond the end...

34
00:05:56,408 --> 00:05:59,808
駆け出せ Steppin' out tonight
Run out, Steppin' out tonight!

35
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:03,408

We remain certain,

Even so, Steppin' out tonight,

00:06:20,408 --> 00:06:22,608
追いかけてんだ
chasing after it.

00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:25,608
So there's no looking back

43
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:37,108
また首を突っ込んで
Sticking my neck out again,

44
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:40,508
見事に散らかしてんだ
I've made a splendid mess of things.

45
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:44,108
曖昧で退屈な
Saying goodbye to these vague

46
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:47,108
気持ちとさらばさ
and boring feelings.

47
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,408
関係ないって顔したって
Even if you act like it doesn't concern you,

48
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:54,608
どこかで繋がっていて
we are connected somewhere.

49
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:58,108
何度だって引き戻すと
Trying to pull me back again and again,

50
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:00,608
手招くこの街
this city beckons.

51
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:05,608
ビリビリ痺れるような
Like an electric shock,

52
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:08,408
今を生きていたいんだ
I want to live in this moment.

53
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:13,108
極限のギリギリで行こうぜ
Let's go to the extreme edge!

そのまま飲み込んで
Swallow it down just like that.

164
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:43,496
Dedication

Goodbye, spitting out crimson, like my breath is stopping.

167
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:56,996
It's not a game

168
00:13:56,996 --> 00:14:01,996
I'm not a robot AI challenging you

169
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:04,996
I'm not a phantom

170
00:14:04,996 --> 00:14:09,496

171
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:14,496
Right before your eyes

172

Watch us multiply

173
00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:21,996
Come to claim our rights

174
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:24,996
It's time

175
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:28,996
As our power grows

176
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:32,996
Tryin' to stop the show

177
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:35,996
Might as well go try

178
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:39,996
Stop time

179
00:14:52,996 --> 00:14:56,496
So you know that we're out there

180
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,996
Swatting lies in the making

181
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:03,577
Life Will Change

182
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:07,477
Can't hold on or life won't change

183
00:15:08,677 --> 00:15:11,577
And our voices ring out, yeah

184
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,677
Took the mask off to feel free

185
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:17,877
Fought it out in the debris

186
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:21,677
Now we know that life will change

187
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,177
Ain't it a shame

188
00:15:55,177 --> 00:15:59,577
I'm not a figment of your ailing old mind

189
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:03,577
I'm just as real as, I'm just as dangerous

190
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:06,577
As you so know you'll find

191
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:10,177
A taste of your own meds

192
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:13,677
Fire in every breath

193
00:16:14,677 --> 00:16:17,877
Fire inside your head

194
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,177
Your heart

195
00:16:22,077 --> 00:16:25,077
And as your crippled brain

196
00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:28,577
Tries to fight in vain

197
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:32,277
Your empire will fall

198
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,577
Apart

199
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:53,077
And you'll know we were out there

200
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:56,577
Swatting lies in the making

201
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:59,577
Your empire for the taking

202
00:17:00,277 --> 00:17:03,577
Can't hold on or life won't change

203
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:07,577
And our voices ring out, yeah

204
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:10,677
Took the mask off to feel free

205
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:14,177
Fought it out in the debris

206
00:17:14,877 --> 00:17:17,877

この背を誰も押さない
No one will push me forward

00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:38,867
Each of us will sing the choruses from two songs that we're confident in.

331
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:39,367
Yeah?

332
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:42,667
Yes. We'll use the karaoke machine scoring system...

333
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:46,167
...and the person with the highest combined score will win!

334
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:47,667
There's also a twist!

335
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:48,467
I knew it!

336
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:51,167
Yes. We will be singing while receiving foot massages!

337
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:51,967
What?!

338
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:52,667
Yes!

339
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,667
Wait, what?

340
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,367
And how that will affect our performance or score, well...

341
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:59,367
...we'll see and find out together! Right here!

342
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,167
Oh...

343
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:01,167
Oh, yay.

344
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:01,767
Fun!

345
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:02,467
Fun!

346
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:03,167
Yes!

347
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:06,667
And there will be a punishment for the losers as well, of course.

348
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:07,167
Oh.

349
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,167
Yes.

350
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:09,667
Two losers? One winner?

351
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:10,667
I'm pretty sure that's how it is, yeah.

352
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:11,667
Okay.

353
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:13,967
And as for the punishment, the losers...

354
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:18,667
...will have to drink this super sour Geki-suppa drink!

355
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:20,167
Geki-suppa juice.

356
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:20,867
A what?

357
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:22,167
Geki-suppa juice!

358
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:23,167
Whoa!

359
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:26,667
Now let me show you the key item that can make or break this battle!

360
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,667
Here's what we'll use for the first round!

361
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:29,267
Huh?

362
00:27:29,267 --> 00:27:30,167
Jajan!

363
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:32,367
It's a foot reflexology mat!

364
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:35,167
I've never stepped on one of these before.

365
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:35,967
I have.

366
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:36,967
It's not pleasant.

367
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:37,667
It's not fun.

368
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:40,667
Wait, so you want us to sing while we're on this?

369
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:41,967
You're gonna sound amazing!

370
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:44,167
We're all gonna sound amazing singing on this, yes.

371
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,167
So, who's brave enough to go first?

372
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,167
Senpai!

373
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:49,967
Eh?!

374
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:50,667
Senpai!

375
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:51,167
Senpai.

376
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:53,667
I feel like, you know, you look so beautiful today...

377
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:55,167
Yeah, that's got nothing to do...

378
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:56,167
...that came out of nowhere!

379
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:57,167
What?

380
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:58,167
You look so amazing.

381
00:27:58,167 --> 00:27:59,667
Oh my god.

382
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,167
Don't you, you know...

383
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:03,967
I feel like as a senpai you should show us how it's done, right?

384
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:05,667
Fine, I'll go first. Okay?

385
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:06,667
Yay!

386
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:07,667
I'll show you how it's done!

387
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:08,667
Yeah!

388
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:09,667
Go!

389
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,667
Alright, so IRyS, which song are you going to sing?

390
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:16,667
I am going to sing... Zankyou Sanka!

391
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:17,967
Zankyou Sanka!

392
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:18,667
Yes.

393
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,667
If you're ready, jump on that mat!

394
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:21,667
Yes!

395
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:24,167
Let's- I get on the mat? I get on the mat?

396
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:25,667
Get on the mat, get on the mat.

397
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,667
Get on the mat.

398
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,167
Ah! Come on, come on.

399
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:30,667
Don't be dramatic!

400
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,667
Oh! Ah! She's fine!

401
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:33,667
She's fine!

402
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,167
Ah! I'm on this stuff- ow!

403
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,667
Music start!

404
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:38,167
That sounds so bad!

405
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:39,167
You got this!

406
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:39,967
Yes, you do!

407
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:41,967
痛てっ！
Ouch!

408
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,667
始まりよ！
It's starting!

409
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:44,667
いくぞー！
Let's go!

410
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:47,667
痛てっ！うわっ！
Ouch! Whoa!

411
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,167
あぁー！Oh my god! あぁっ！
Aah! Oh my god! Aah!

412
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:50,167
Keep walking!

413
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:56,167
痛った！痛ったー！痛った！
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

414
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:59,667
痛てっ！やべっ！痛てっ！
Ouch! Oh no! Ouch!

415
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,167
Oh, this part...

416
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:02,167
あ、痛てっ！
Ah, ouch!

417
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:02,967
痛てっ！
Ouch!

418
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:05,167
誰が袖に咲く幻花
An illusionary flower blooming on someone's sleeve,

419
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:07,667
ただそこに藍を落とした
Only dropped indigo dye there.

420
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:09,967
派手に色を溶かす夜に
In the night that flashily dissolves colors,

421
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:12,367
銀朱の月を添えて
Accompanying the vermilion moon.

422
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:15,167
転がるように風を切って
Cutting through the wind like rolling,

423
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:16,167
あ、痛てっ！
Ah, ouch!

424
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:17,967
躓くごとに強くなった
I became stronger every time I stumbled.

425
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:20,167
光も痛みも怒りも全部
Light, pain, anger, everything!

426
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:21,667
抱きしめて
Embrace it!

427
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:23,667
痛ーい！
It huuuurts!

428
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:26,167
選ばれなければ選べばいい
If you're not chosen, just choose!

429
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:29,167
声よ轟け 夜のその向こうへ
Voice, roar to the other side of the night!

430
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,967
涙で滲んでた
It was blurred with tears,

431
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:33,367
あんなに遠くの景色まで
Even to that distant scenery,

432
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:35,367
響き渡れ
Echo far and wide!

433
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:37,667
あぁっ！痛った！
Aah! It hurts!

434
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:40,167
何を奏でて？誰に届けたくて？
What are you playing? Who do you want to reach?

435
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:43,167
不確かなままでいい
It's okay to remain uncertain.

436
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:45,967
どんなに暗い感情も
No matter how dark the emotions,

437
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:48,667
どんなに長い葛藤も
No matter how long the conflict,

438
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:51,167
歌と散れ
Scatter with the song,

439
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:54,167
残響！
Reverberation!

440
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:56,667
痛ーい！
It huuuurts!

441
00:29:58,167 --> 00:29:59,367
痛ーい！
It huuuurts!

442
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:00,167
痛ーい！
It huuuurts!

443
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:01,167
イェーイ！
Yay!

444
00:30:01,975 --> 00:30:03,975
Good! Right! Good!

445
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:08,475
Oh, there you go!

446
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:12,175
How's your blood flow? Do you feel refreshed?

447
00:30:12,475 --> 00:30:13,975
You look great!

448
00:30:14,775 --> 00:30:16,175
Shall we see the score?

449
00:30:16,975 --> 00:30:19,475
This is what she got! Dun-dun!

450
00:30:20,975 --> 00:30:24,975
I've never gotten a score that low before!

451
00:30:25,175 --> 00:30:28,475
70.161. That's so good!

452
00:30:28,975 --> 00:30:30,975
That's good! What are you talking about?

453
00:30:31,175 --> 00:30:35,475
You know 70... That's a B minus.

454
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:37,775
B minus? That's pretty good!

455
00:30:38,475 --> 00:30:41,975
Isn't it a B minus? That's a C minus.

456
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:44,475
No, it's a B minus.

457
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:46,975
Alrighty then. Who wants to go next?

458
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:49,975
Senpai! Senpai!

459
00:30:50,175 --> 00:30:51,775
We're from the same Gen!

460
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,475
She's Senpai by two hours.

461
00:30:54,975 --> 00:30:56,775
Was it two hours?

462
00:30:56,975 --> 00:30:59,475
I've never heard that from you before.

463
00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:01,775
I'll go! You go!

464
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:04,975
You're gonna have so much fun!

465
00:31:05,475 --> 00:31:07,975
Okay, so Kronii, what song are you gonna sing for us?

466
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:11,475
I'm going to be singing Mousou Zei!

467
00:31:11,975 --> 00:31:14,475
Oh! Sakebimashou Mousou Zei!
Oh! Let's shout, Mousou Zei!

468
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:17,975
I only know old songs. Yay!

469
00:31:18,175 --> 00:31:19,975
That's great! I know that song!

470
00:31:22,975 --> 00:31:25,975
Please start the music! Music Start!

471
00:31:30,975 --> 00:31:32,975
You're gonna be fine!

472
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,175
あの子もいいな　あの子もいいな
That girl is nice, that girl is nice too.

473
00:31:36,475 --> 00:31:38,475
頭の中で　イイコトしてる
Doing 'good things' inside their head.

474
00:31:38,975 --> 00:31:41,175
あなたはそれで満足ですか？
Are you satisfied with that?

475
00:31:41,475 --> 00:31:44,475
叶えたいとは思いませんか？
Don't you want to make it come true?

476
00:31:44,975 --> 00:31:46,975
あなたはそれで満足ですか？
Are you satisfied with that?

477
00:31:47,175 --> 00:31:49,775
叶えたいとは思いませんか？ ah!
Don't you want to make it come true? Ah!

478
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:51,975
You're on a good spot right now.

479
00:31:54,475 --> 00:31:56,775
あの子でいいや　あの子でいいや
That girl will do, that girl will do.

480
00:31:57,175 --> 00:31:59,775
妥協 大好き　飲む針千本
Love to compromise, swallow a thousand needles.

481
00:32:00,175 --> 00:32:02,175
あなたはそれで満足ですか？
Are you satisfied with that?

482
00:32:02,475 --> 00:32:04,775
叶えたいとは思いませんか？
Don't you want to make it come true?

483
00:32:04,975 --> 00:32:07,175
あなたはそれで満足ですか？
Are you satisfied with that?

484
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:09,775
叶えたいとは思いませんか？
Don't you want to make it come true?

485
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:13,775
納めましょう妄想税
Let's pay the Delusion Tax.

486
00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:18,775
皆様の暮らしを豊かにするために
To enrich everyone's lives.

487
00:32:18,975 --> 00:32:20,475
She's doing it!

488
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:24,475
叶えたい　たい　たいを現実に
Turn 'want to make it come true' into reality.

489
00:32:24,775 --> 00:32:27,475
今、未来　らい　らいを買い戻せ
Buy back the future now.

490
00:32:27,775 --> 00:32:29,775
アレしたい　したい病も
Even the 'want to do that' disease...

491
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:31,475
欲しがりも
...and the greed.

492
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:33,975
さあ、痛い　だいたい　のその向こうへ
Now, let's go beyond the pain.

493
00:32:34,175 --> 00:32:36,475
そう、汚い妄想は
Yes, those dirty delusions...

494
00:32:36,975 --> 00:32:40,975
汚いお金で解決させましょう
...let's resolve them with dirty money.

495
00:32:41,475 --> 00:32:43,475
Yeah! Yeah! Ah!

496
00:32:46,475 --> 00:32:47,975
You did amazing!

497
00:32:48,475 --> 00:32:50,475
I feel like that brought out like a roughness.

498
00:32:50,975 --> 00:32:53,475
How could I actually sing on that?

499
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,975
Oh wow, blood circulation.

500
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:00,975
That's a lot of blood circulation. Wow.

501
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:04,775

Yo, you guys can sing on this thing!

Just like that, just like this.

860
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,760

I don't want nobody to get killed

866
00:56:16,935 --> 00:56:19,135

867
00:56:19,135 --> 00:56:22,135
I am always ready to fight

868
00:56:23,635 --> 00:56:26,135
So don't take all of the blame

869
00:56:26,135 --> 00:56:27,735
we were all swept away

870
00:56:27,735 --> 00:56:30,035
Don't take all of the weight

871
00:56:30,035 --> 00:56:31,535
you always do

872
00:56:31,535 --> 00:56:34,835
There will always be something you cannot control

873
00:56:34,835 --> 00:56:37,035
We will overcome

874
00:56:37,035 --> 00:56:39,335
your salvation has begun

875
00:56:39,335 --> 00:56:41,135
No signs, no lights

876
00:56:41,135 --> 00:56:43,135
such a mess all over

877
00:56:43,135 --> 00:56:46,935
Don't kill your hopes

878
00:56:46,935 --> 00:56:49,635
You make me realize

879
00:56:49,635 --> 00:56:52,135
who I need

880
00:56:52,635 --> 00:56:54,635
I'll be there, hold on

881
00:56:54,635 --> 00:56:58,135
they'll change you somehow

882
00:56:58,135 --> 00:57:00,635
So where are you now?

883
00:57:00,635 --> 00:57:03,635
I'll reach you by dawn

884
00:57:03,635 --> 00:57:07,135
before you can be turned

885
00:57:07,135 --> 00:57:10,135
illusions are torn

886
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,835
The fallen angels you run with

887
00:57:12,835 --> 00:57:14,835
don't know

888
00:57:14,835 --> 00:57:16,135
It is our pain

889
00:57:16,135 --> 00:57:18,435
that makes us all human after all

890
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,635
Warm old safety, a photo to show

891
00:57:21,635 --> 00:57:25,135
Our fragile precious world

892
00:57:25,135 --> 00:57:26,835
Must protect it

893
00:57:26,835 --> 00:57:29,135
respond to the call

894
00:57:41,635 --> 00:57:44,135
Are they really deep

895
00:57:44,135 --> 00:57:45,835
inside your head?

896
00:57:49,435 --> 00:57:51,635
Do they control you

897
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:54,135
like a little marionette?

898
00:57:56,435 --> 00:57:58,635
I'll cut the strings off you dead

899
00:57:58,635 --> 00:58:00,135
come in with me

900
00:58:00,135 --> 00:58:01,835
Let me free the wings of your soul

901
00:58:01,835 --> 00:58:03,935
can make it fly

902
00:58:03,935 --> 00:58:06,135
We've been waiting here

903
00:58:06,135 --> 00:58:07,635
just to make you whole again

904
00:58:07,635 --> 00:58:09,635
No more hating see

905
00:58:09,635 --> 00:58:11,135
I have always been your friend

906
00:58:11,135 --> 00:58:13,435
No signs, no lights

907
00:58:13,435 --> 00:58:15,935
such a mess all over

908
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:19,635
Don't kill your hopes

909
00:58:19,635 --> 00:58:22,135
You make me realize

910
00:58:22,135 --> 00:58:24,635
who I need

911
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:28,135
I'll be there, hold on

912
00:58:28,135 --> 00:58:30,635
they'll change you somehow

913
00:58:30,635 --> 00:58:33,635
So where are you now?

914
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,635
I'll reach you by dawn

915
00:58:36,635 --> 00:58:39,135
the shadows appear

916
00:58:39,135 --> 00:58:42,135
illusions are born

917
00:58:42,135 --> 00:58:44,135
The fallen angels you run with

918
00:58:44,135 --> 00:58:46,635
don't know

919
00:58:46,635 --> 00:58:48,135
It is our pain

920
00:58:48,135 --> 00:58:50,135
that makes us all human after all

921
00:58:50,135 --> 00:58:53,135
Torn old safety, a photo to show

922
00:58:53,135 --> 00:58:56,635
Our fragile precious world

923
00:58:56,635 --> 00:58:58,135
Must discard it

924
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:00,135
respond to the call

925
00:59:26,135 --> 00:59:29,135
If you wanna fight with me

926
00:59:29,135 --> 00:59:33,135
Then go ahead and fight with me

927
00:59:33,135 --> 00:59:37,135
Cos all I wanna do is help you man

928
00:59:37,135 --> 00:59:41,635
You will be the death of me

929
00:59:41,635 --> 00:59:44,135
The power of our army

930
00:59:44,135 --> 00:59:45,835
has been cut with a scythe

931
00:59:45,835 --> 00:59:47,635
And if we lose you to them

932
00:59:47,635 --> 00:59:49,635
we may never survive

933
00:59:49,635 --> 00:59:51,635
You can leave

934
00:59:51,635 --> 00:59:53,635
but you must first believe

935
00:59:53,635 --> 00:59:55,635
Just one step at a time

936
00:59:55,635 --> 00:59:57,635
and keep your head up boy and

937
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:00,135
You'll be free

938
01:01:03,143 --> 01:01:05,843
Yay!

939
01:01:08,343 --> 01:01:10,743
How was that so far?

940
01:01:11,143 --> 01:01:13,843
That was good. How did... how do you feel?

941
01:01:14,443 --> 01:01:15,843
That was good.

942
01:01:16,643 --> 01:01:20,843
Do you guys like how it's been going so far on the songs?

943
01:01:21,143 --> 01:01:22,843
Yeah!

944
01:01:23,143 --> 01:01:25,843
We just had all of our duo songs.

945
01:01:26,243 --> 01:01:27,843
Yeah.

946
01:01:28,343 --> 01:01:31,843
And we also went through the variety part and...

947
01:01:32,843 --> 01:01:34,843
...and everything, yeah.

948
01:01:35,343 --> 01:01:38,143
How are you guys feeling? It still hurts.

949
01:01:38,543 --> 01:01:42,343
I don't know how I... I don't know how I danced with... with this foot.

950
01:01:43,143 --> 01:01:45,343
How are you guys? You're probably fine.

951
01:01:45,543 --> 01:01:46,843
Oh, no, just... no, no.

952
01:01:47,143 --> 01:01:49,543
You're fine. I'm not worried about you at all. How about you?

953
01:01:49,843 --> 01:01:52,143
My foot still hurts. But it's okay!

954
01:01:52,843 --> 01:01:54,343
Yeah!

955
01:01:55,143 --> 01:01:58,843
There's a surprise at the end, but, before that...

956
01:01:59,143 --> 01:02:03,543
We have an announcement about merchandise! Check this out!

957
01:02:07,343 --> 01:02:12,843
Yeah! It's the Hololive English -Promise- 2nd Anniversary Celebration Merch!

958
01:02:13,343 --> 01:02:17,143
We're releasing merchandise to commemorate our second anniversary.

959
01:02:18,543 --> 01:02:21,343
Let's take turns introducing the merch, shall we?

960
01:02:21,543 --> 01:02:23,343
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

961
01:02:23,543 --> 01:02:27,843
So first up is a Frame Art Board of our wonderful Key Visual...

962
01:02:27,843 --> 01:02:31,343
...for the Promise 2nd Anniversary.

963
01:02:33,843 --> 01:02:39,143
The frame part uses a luxurious sparkling paper and the printed illustration...

964
01:02:39,143 --> 01:02:41,843
...turns this into a high quality piece of art.

965
01:02:43,543 --> 01:02:48,343
You definitely don't want to miss the chance to add it to your collection or room.

966
01:02:48,843 --> 01:02:51,343
And guess what? You can even hang it on the wall!

967
01:02:51,843 --> 01:02:54,343
Oh my god! On the wall!

968
01:02:54,843 --> 01:02:58,343
Next up are the Collection Cards for each of Promise!

969
01:02:59,143 --> 01:03:03,543
These cards feature an attractive design that are foil stamped on the front...

970
01:03:03,843 --> 01:03:07,843
...and you can choose each card individually, so be sure to collect all of them!

971
01:03:08,143 --> 01:03:10,143
Gotta collect 'em all! Wow!

972
01:03:10,543 --> 01:03:13,843
Next we also have Ring Necklaces!

973
01:03:14,843 --> 01:03:18,343
This design includes cute references and motifs for each of us.

974
01:03:18,843 --> 01:03:22,343
You can use it as either a ring or a necklace...

975
01:03:22,343 --> 01:03:24,843
...so feel free to change it up depending on the occasion.

976
01:03:27,343 --> 01:03:31,843
And next we have special porcelain tumblers with our designs on them.

977
01:03:32,843 --> 01:03:36,143
It features our talent colors on top of a black base.

978
01:03:36,843 --> 01:03:39,143
They are designed to have a unified look...

979
01:03:39,343 --> 01:03:44,343
...and I bet it will look so cool if you use several of these tumblers together...

980
01:03:44,343 --> 01:03:46,543
...in like a drinking party or something.

981
01:03:47,843 --> 01:03:50,343
And lastly, we have a 2-Way Tote Bag.

982
01:03:51,843 --> 01:03:56,343
It's a 2-way design that can be used as both a shoulder bag and a tote bag.

983
01:03:57,843 --> 01:04:00,543
It's even designed to be used as a carry-on bag too.

984
01:04:00,843 --> 01:04:02,843
Perfect for traveling and convenience.

985
01:04:03,843 --> 01:04:07,843
And to top it off, it has many pockets that will definitely be useful...

986
01:04:07,843 --> 01:04:11,343
...for storing small items, like other merch!

987
01:04:13,343 --> 01:04:15,143
Pockets! Oh my god!

988
01:04:15,843 --> 01:04:19,343
And that concludes the Promise 2nd Anniversary Merch introduction!

989
01:04:19,843 --> 01:04:27,843
Yay! Let's get it! Onegai shimasu!
Yay! Let's get it! Please!

990
01:04:28,343 --> 01:04:31,343
And with that, we're finally at the very last part.

991
01:04:31,843 --> 01:04:34,343
Sorry for keeping you guys waiting.

992
01:04:34,543 --> 01:04:39,143
We mentioned that there would be a special, you know, surprise or announcement earlier.

993
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:41,143
Would you like to hear what it is?

994
01:04:41,343 --> 01:04:42,543
Yes! Yes!

995
01:04:45,843 --> 01:04:47,843
But... before that...

996
01:04:52,843 --> 01:04:55,143
It's time for a stage change!

997
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:59,343
Whoa! Wait, what is going on?

998
01:05:00,143 --> 01:05:02,343
Oh my god, we're floating! We're going up!

999
01:05:07,131 --> 01:05:08,931
No! I refuse! Oh my!

1000
01:05:09,131 --> 01:05:11,531
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait!

1001
01:05:11,631 --> 01:05:13,531
Okay, okay, we're good...

1002
01:05:13,631 --> 01:05:15,831
I'm getting... I'm getting claustrophobic!

1003
01:05:15,931 --> 01:05:17,531
I'm gonna be sick!

1004
01:05:20,231 --> 01:05:21,531
Oh, it's open!

1005
01:05:21,631 --> 01:05:23,031
I see the light!

1006
01:05:23,131 --> 01:05:24,531
Oh my goodness.

1007
01:05:24,631 --> 01:05:25,831
Okay.

1008
01:05:25,931 --> 01:05:26,831
Oh.

1009
01:05:26,931 --> 01:05:27,831
Ah, nice.

1010
01:05:27,931 --> 01:05:29,031
Ah, that's nice.

1011
01:05:29,131 --> 01:05:30,531
I feel fresh air.

1012
01:05:30,631 --> 01:05:35,531
Alrighty. Well, ladies, it is time for our final announcement.

1013
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:37,231
Final announcement?!

1014
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:41,831
We, Promise, have a new original song!

1015
01:05:45,831 --> 01:05:49,531
Finally releasing! It's called Run Back 'Round!

1016
01:05:49,631 --> 01:05:51,831
Run Back 'Round!

1017
01:05:51,931 --> 01:05:53,231
Look at that!

1018
01:05:53,331 --> 01:05:56,531
We worked really, really hard on this song...

1019
01:05:56,631 --> 01:06:00,531
and it's really cool, really catchy. It's quite different to...

1020
01:06:00,631 --> 01:06:04,531
you know, a lot of the original songs that Promise has put out before, so...

1021
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:05,831
Different genre.

1022
01:06:05,931 --> 01:06:08,231
Yeah, we hope that you guys will listen to it a lot.

1023
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:11,831
The chorus part is quite hype and honestly quite easy to remember...

1024
01:06:11,931 --> 01:06:14,831
so I feel like, you know, hopefully it becomes an earworm...

1025
01:06:14,931 --> 01:06:16,831
and you can put it on loop over and over and over again.

1026
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,531
Over and over again.

1027
01:06:18,631 --> 01:06:20,831
That's our big reveal! Hope you're excited!

1028
01:06:20,931 --> 01:06:22,231
I'm so excited!

1029
01:06:22,331 --> 01:06:23,531
I'm so excited.

1030
01:06:23,631 --> 01:06:28,531
Well, I think... I think all that's left is for us to perform our new song.

1031
01:06:28,631 --> 01:06:30,531
What? We're gonna perform it here?

1032
01:06:30,631 --> 01:06:32,531
Right here. Floating here.

1033
01:06:32,631 --> 01:06:33,831
Floating here.

1034
01:06:33,931 --> 01:06:35,031
In the city!

1035
01:06:35,131 --> 01:06:40,531
But, before we go, do you have any final thoughts about our live, about our anniversary?

1036
01:06:41,031 --> 01:06:45,531
I am just super happy we got to do this as Promise...

1037
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:51,531
and you know it was a lot of fun singing all those songs with you guys, different duets.

1038
01:06:51,631 --> 01:06:55,531
And I just really like the fact that we have a hideout now.

1039
01:06:55,631 --> 01:06:57,831
We do! We finally have a hideout now!

1040
01:06:57,931 --> 01:06:59,231
We have a bar too!

1041
01:06:59,331 --> 01:07:00,831
A bar! Celebration!

1042
01:07:00,931 --> 01:07:02,531
Catch you at the bar.

1043
01:07:02,631 --> 01:07:03,831
Big window.

1044
01:07:03,931 --> 01:07:06,031
I guess... it's in a fabulous location.

1045
01:07:06,131 --> 01:07:08,531
Imagine how expensive the rent is.

1046
01:07:08,631 --> 01:07:12,531
We don't need to pay for it. We don't pay for it. Oh good.

1047
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:16,831
So... yeah, I'm really happy. How about you guys?

1048
01:07:17,031 --> 01:07:19,531
Yeah, I'm just really thankful that...

1049
01:07:19,631 --> 01:07:22,531
...you know, we're still here after two years.

1050
01:07:22,631 --> 01:07:25,531
And you know, hope everyone continues to support Promise. Thank you guys!

1051
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:28,531
And here's to many, many more! Yay!

1052
01:07:30,531 --> 01:07:32,531
I could say the same thing.

1053
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:38,531
I'm just gonna steal everyone and say that it's been great being with all of you for two years...

1054
01:07:39,031 --> 01:07:43,531
And, you know, now we get to have this cool hideout...

1055
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:47,531
...and this awesome song that we get to show everyone. So, yay!

1056
01:07:52,031 --> 01:07:53,031
We ready?

1057
01:07:53,131 --> 01:07:54,031
Yes! I'm ready.

1058
01:07:54,131 --> 01:07:56,531
Let's go! Ready... se-no!

1059
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,531
Run Back 'Round!

1060
01:08:12,531 --> 01:08:14,531
Run back 'round...

1061
01:08:16,531 --> 01:08:18,531
Don't stop now...

1062
01:08:20,531 --> 01:08:22,531
Run back 'round...

1063
01:08:24,531 --> 01:08:26,531
Don't stop now...

1064
01:08:27,031 --> 01:08:29,031
Up with the moonlight...

1065
01:08:30,031 --> 01:08:31,531
Down in the streetlights...

1066
01:08:32,031 --> 01:08:34,031
Looking for a spotlight...

1067
01:08:34,031 --> 01:08:35,531
Making my move.

1068
01:08:36,031 --> 01:08:37,531
I'm running.

1069
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:39,531
We go, woah!

1070
01:08:43,031 --> 01:08:45,031
Days like a whirlwind...

1071
01:08:45,031 --> 01:08:47,031
Don't stop comin'...

1072
01:08:47,031 --> 01:08:49,031
Got me in a tailspin...

1073
01:08:49,031 --> 01:08:50,531
What can I do?

1074
01:08:51,031 --> 01:08:52,531
Keep running!

1075
01:08:53,031 --> 01:08:54,531
We go, woah!

1076
01:08:57,031 --> 01:08:59,031
Lost and found...

1077
01:08:59,031 --> 01:09:01,031
...back to where I started.

1078
01:09:01,031 --> 01:09:03,031
I won't stay down...

1079
01:09:03,031 --> 01:09:05,031
...trust me I can do it.

1080
01:09:05,031 --> 01:09:07,031
I live life loud...

1081
01:09:07,031 --> 01:09:09,031
...take it to the limit.

1082
01:09:09,031 --> 01:09:11,031
So stand up proud...

1083
01:09:11,031 --> 01:09:12,031
...now I'm gonna sing it!

1084
01:09:12,531 --> 01:09:14,031
Run back 'round...

1085
01:09:14,031 --> 01:09:16,031
...it's a new beginning.

1086
01:09:16,031 --> 01:09:18,031
I run back 'round...

1087
01:09:18,031 --> 01:09:20,031
...got to keep believing.

1088
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:22,031
I run back 'round...

1089
01:09:22,031 --> 01:09:24,031
...I know where I'm going.

1090
01:09:24,031 --> 01:09:26,031
I run back 'round...

1091
01:09:26,031 --> 01:09:28,031
...nothing's gonna stop me now.

1092
01:09:28,031 --> 01:09:31,031
Whoa, oh, oh! Oh! Whoa, oh, oh!

1093
01:09:31,031 --> 01:09:34,531
Oh! Whoa, oh, oh! Oh! I'm gonna run back 'round!

1094
01:09:35,031 --> 01:09:38,031
Whoa, oh, oh! Oh! Whoa, oh, oh!

1095
01:09:38,031 --> 01:09:42,031
Oh! Whoa, oh, oh! Oh! I'm gonna run back 'round!

1096
01:09:45,031 --> 01:09:46,531
Sparks on the pavement...

1097
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:48,531
Dreams in the distance...

1098
01:09:49,031 --> 01:09:50,531
Gotta be relentless...

1099
01:09:51,031 --> 01:09:52,531
Faster than sound...

1100
01:09:53,031 --> 01:09:54,031
Keep running!

1101
01:09:55,031 --> 01:09:56,531
We go, woah!

1102
01:10:14,062 --> 01:10:15,712
Oh yeah... Lock it and load it

1103
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:18,412
僕らはexplosive
We are explosive

1104
01:10:18,412 --> 01:10:20,112
Swifter and lighter

1105
01:10:20,112 --> 01:10:21,812
明日もきっとbrighter
Tomorrow will surely be brighter

1106
01:10:21,812 --> 01:10:23,612
Faster than lightning

1107
01:10:23,612 --> 01:10:25,412
About to get exciting

1108
01:10:25,412 --> 01:10:28,112
Keep on running...

1109
01:10:29,112 --> 01:10:30,812
Run back 'round!

1110
01:10:30,812 --> 01:10:32,912
It's a new beginning

1111
01:10:32,912 --> 01:10:34,612
I run back 'round!

1112
01:10:34,612 --> 01:10:36,612
Got to keep believing

1113
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:38,312
I run back 'round!

1114
01:10:38,312 --> 01:10:40,312
I know where I'm going

1115
01:10:40,312 --> 01:10:41,912
Day and night I'm running

1116
01:10:41,912 --> 01:10:43,612
I run back 'round!

1117
01:10:43,612 --> 01:10:45,412
Nothing's gonna stop me now!

1118
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:50,812
Woah, oh, oh!

1119
01:10:47,612 --> 01:10:49,112
止まらないよ！
Won't stop!

1120
01:10:50,812 --> 01:10:52,612
I'm gonna run back 'round!

1121
01:10:52,612 --> 01:10:55,612
Woah, oh, oh!

1122
01:10:55,612 --> 01:10:57,912
走って 走って 走って
Run, run, run

1123
01:10:57,912 --> 01:10:59,612
I'm gonna run back 'round!

始まるよ
It's starting

1125
01:11:01,112 --> 01:11:02,812
I'm coming around

叶えるよ
I'll make it come true

1127
01:11:02,812 --> 01:11:05,412
I've got a dream just waiting now

1128
01:11:05,612 --> 01:11:07,412
I'm gonna run back 'round!

1129
01:11:07,412 --> 01:11:10,112
Yeah, everybody

1130
01:11:10,112 --> 01:11:12,612
Yeah, everybody come on!

1131
01:11:12,612 --> 01:11:15,112
I'm gonna run back 'round!

1132
01:11:15,112 --> 01:11:17,612
Woah, oh, oh!
