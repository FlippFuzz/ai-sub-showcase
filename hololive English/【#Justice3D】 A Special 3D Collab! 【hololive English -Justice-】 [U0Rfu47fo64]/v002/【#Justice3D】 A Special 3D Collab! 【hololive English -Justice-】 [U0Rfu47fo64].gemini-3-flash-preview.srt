00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:38,208
What's wrong, what's right with you?

64
00:05:38,808 --> 00:05:41,508
Run in the night of my brio

65
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,208
Come take a bite

66
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:46,108
Never ending ending star

00:05:46,308 --> 00:05:49,608
You'll never focus up, you'll never focus up

68
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,308
No one to just forget

69
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:57,608
We rise up! We rise up! Yes!

70
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:02,808
Standing on the edge of the unpredictable,

71
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:05,408
beautiful, physical, you got nowhere to go

72
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:09,108
Show you something real, high level,

00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:11,908
no you'll never know, out of control

74
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:14,908
The law you should know

75
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,308
Just a little unpredictable, beautiful,

76
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:19,408
just look at it, look at it baby, go

77
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:23,408
Next level, almost criminal, out of control

78
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:26,208
It goes below

79
00:06:38,508 --> 00:06:41,008

80
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:45,008
Yay!

81
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:48,408
Hello everyone!

82
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,108
Hello!

83
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,008
Hi everyone!

84
00:06:51,508 --> 00:06:52,008
Hello!

85
00:06:52,108 --> 00:06:55,208
At last, we are in 3D and we've gotten

86
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,808
to perform "Above Below"!

87
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,608
Yay! My god!

88
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:03,108
I feel like our performance was awesome!

89
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,108
Awesome!

90
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,408
If you really liked the show from it, remember we

91
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:11,408
have a hashtag, #Justice3D. Post it on social

92
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:12,708
media and we'd love to see that!

93
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:14,308
Huzzah!

94
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:17,008
Now that we're finally in 3D guys... you want to

95
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:18,908
do an introduction but full energy with a pose?

96
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,008
Full pose?

97
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,008
Full poses?

98
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,708
We have some full poses.

99
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:27,708
Alright, okay.

100
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,408
Roses are red, the fire of my heart is blue,

101
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:35,408
also known as the Scarlet Queen,

102
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:37,308

117
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:40,808
Big cat means BIG TROUBLE!

118
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:45,308
And everyone, take a look at where we are now!

119
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:48,308
Ta-da!

120
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:52,508
The Justice hideout!

121
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:55,408
It's finally done!

122
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:57,908
I guess I gotta take off my skirt.

123
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,008
What?!

124
00:08:59,108 --> 00:09:00,608
Whoa, what are you doing?

125
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,108
Look away! Look away!

126
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:04,508
Oh my god, Cecilia!

127
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,308
It's not naked!

128
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:12,408
This is some gotcha, very, very normal pants.

129
00:09:13,508 --> 00:09:15,508
Alright, that was wrong. That felt wrong.

130
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:17,508
Well maybe you shouldn't have done it.

131
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:20,508
Can we sit down though?

132
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:22,508
Yeah, let's sit down.

133
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:24,008
HR? HR?

134
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:26,008
Calling HR!

135
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:28,008
Please! Oh, please!

136
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:29,808
What's happening now?

137
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:31,908
They're fighting again.

138
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:40,008
Stop fighting! Get on your places and shut up!

139
00:09:41,008 --> 00:09:43,008
So guys, what's the plan for today?

140
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:45,008
How about we...

141
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:48,008
Ice cream!

142
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:49,908
How about we get some ice cream? Liz, ice cream?

143
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:52,508
Well, it's our 3D debut,

144
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:56,508
so I think it'd be nice to do something fun of course.

145
00:09:57,808 --> 00:09:59,508
Ice cream! Ice cream is fun!

146
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,816
Maybe we should play a game? Maybe a game?

147
00:10:01,816 --> 00:10:05,416
And then whoever wins gets ice cream! Treat!

148
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,516
ATTEEEEEEEENTION!

149
00:10:08,516 --> 00:10:13,116
Up and at 'em, maggots! It's time to get to work!

150
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:22,516
No slacking off while I, Sergeant Smokey, am busting my scales off for justice!

151
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:27,716
Heeey, long time no see you! How are you doing? Oh, it's nice to see you!

152
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:30,516
"Heeey"?! GET IT TOGETHER!!!

153
00:10:30,516 --> 00:10:35,416
Now line up and stand at attention, peabrains!!

154
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,616
Ah... okay, calm down, Dees.

155
00:10:38,616 --> 00:10:44,216
Let's just do as Smokey says. It's his first big appearance. He seems pretty fired up.

156
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:47,816
Okay, I will do it for you, Liz.

157
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:51,516
All right, let's go! Huddle up! All together!

158
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:54,516
All for Liz! Let's go!

159
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:57,316
Alright, Smokey!

160
00:10:57,316 --> 00:11:00,616
Enough talking! Do I make myself clear?!

161
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:03,916
SIR! YES! SIR!

162
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:07,116
I can't hear you!

163
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:11,316
SIR! YES! SIR!

164
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:13,716
Show me your war face!

165
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:23,216
(War face screaming)

166
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:29,616
Headquarters tells me you've been getting sloppy, so I'm here to set things straight!

167
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:34,516
I've got a few brutal challenges lined up to whip your sorry hides into shape!

168
00:11:34,516 --> 00:11:39,216
Whoa! Oh! What the freak?

169
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:42,316
Has that always been there?

170
00:11:42,316 --> 00:11:46,016
Whoa! Let's go look! Let's go look!

171
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:52,016
Oh, the freak! Whoa! Wow!

172
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:54,516
Alright, read the rules!

173
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:57,116
Here we are. Let's see what it says.

174
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,616

00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:40,524
I'm scared.

339
00:19:40,524 --> 00:19:42,524
You should be scared. I'm scared of really hard questions.

340
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:44,224
You've been doing great.

341
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,324
Okay, are you ready, Gigi? I'm ready!

342
00:19:46,324 --> 00:19:52,524
Okay, let's get started. Three! Two! One! Start!

343
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:57,024
Which flower best represents Elizabeth? / エリザベスを花に例えると？
Which flower best represents Elizabeth? / Which flower best represents Elizabeth?

344
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,224
Which flower best represents Elizabeth?

345
00:19:54,524 --> 00:19:56,524
Skip! Whoa!

346
00:19:57,024 --> 00:20:00,024
Cecilia's signature greeting is 'Spin to OOO!' / Ceciliaの挨拶といえば 'Spin to OOO!'
Cecilia's signature greeting is 'Spin to OOO!' / Cecilia's signature greeting is 'Spin to OOO!'

347
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:59,024
Cecilia's signature greeting is 'Spin to OOO!'

348
00:19:58,524 --> 00:20:00,024
Skip! What? Oh wait, wait, wait! Keep it!

349
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,332
Uh, no, it's got it.

350
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:02,132
W!

351
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:03,032
I!

352
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:04,232
N, Enter!

353
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:06,532
WIN! Enter! Yes!

354
00:20:07,532 --> 00:20:08,532
C!

355
00:20:08,532 --> 00:20:09,332
H!

356
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:10,232
A!

357
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:11,832
T-T!

358
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:12,732
I!

359
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:14,532
N-O! I! Enter!

360
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:18,432
Ahhh! Okay! Come on!

361
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:19,432
I!

362
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:20,332
S! A!

363
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:21,232
A! C!

364
00:20:21,232 --> 00:20:22,432
N! E!

365
00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:23,532
W! T!

366
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:25,032
O! N!

367
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:26,532
Enter!

368
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:27,732
Give it up! Okay, okay, okay.

369
00:20:27,732 --> 00:20:30,532
This feels way shorter than William Shakespeare.

370
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,232
Skip!

371
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,532
Skip! Only one point!

372
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:37,432
Skip! Only one point!

373
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:42,532
What the... Oh, you got this, you got this big one!

374
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,532
Skip! I don't care.

375
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:45,332
Skip! I don't care.

376
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:48,332
Skip! I don't care.

377
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:54,632
Think about it!

378
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:56,532
Think, Gigi, oh no!

379
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:01,032
Come on! Come on!

380
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:03,432
Is it gas or air?

381
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:05,432
Oxygen!

382
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,532
O-X-Y...

383
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:11,532
...G-E-N! Enter!

384
00:21:19,432 --> 00:21:23,032
Okay, okay. Isaac Newton versus William Shakespeare...

385
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,732
...and they gave the same amount of points?

386
00:21:25,732 --> 00:21:27,532
That's not... I think that's super unfair.

387
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:29,432
Smokey's doing Smokey's...

388
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:32,332
Yeah, I think it's unfair to play a game where we need to read.

389
00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:37,232
That's not... Well, anyways, do you want to know the winner? Do you want to know your score?

390
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:39,232
What's my score?

391
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:40,832
I want to know, CC! What is it?

392
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,832
What is it? It's 10 points!

393
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:52,532
Good job, Gigi! This is why you are a member of Justice!

394
00:21:53,532 --> 00:21:58,532
Smokey: Hmph... Looks like you maggots still need some serious training...

395
00:22:25,532 --> 00:22:29,032
Alright, time for the second trial, you knuckleheads.

396
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:32,532
I got some special training gear for you!

397
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:31,032
Gear?

398
00:22:31,032 --> 00:22:32,532
Alright.

399
00:22:32,532 --> 00:22:34,532
Alright. I was just chilling.

400
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:38,532
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

401
00:22:38,532 --> 00:22:40,032
Abuse!

402
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:41,532
What is this?

403
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:43,532
Ah, yes, we are going to have a duel.

404
00:22:43,532 --> 00:22:44,832
Gigi! Rules!!

405
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,532
Rules! Rule 1 of Dizzy Combat...

406
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,032
...split into 2 groups!

407
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:53,032
And then one member on each team is blindfolded.

408
00:22:53,032 --> 00:22:55,732
And we have to spin five times. To win.

409
00:22:56,032 --> 00:22:58,232
Oh, man, you're good at this, CC.

410
00:22:58,232 --> 00:23:01,032
And after you spin five times...

411
00:23:01,032 --> 00:23:03,532
...you will face off against each other in an epic sword battle!

412
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:06,532
To the death? Oh, my...

413
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:08,532
While being blindfolded! To the death? To the death!

414
00:23:08,532 --> 00:23:10,532
To the death! Me? Me?

415
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:13,532
To the death! To the death!

416
00:23:13,532 --> 00:23:16,532
And the remaining teammate can guide the blindfolded player...

417
00:23:16,532 --> 00:23:19,532
...using only their voice to help them locate the target.

418
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:22,032
It's like a co-op game.

419
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:23,532
It's like a co-op game. Okay, okay.

420
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:26,532
First, before you pick a team, the points for each target:

421
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:28,532
Head... 5 points.

422
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,032
Head, okay, okay.

423
00:23:31,032 --> 00:23:33,532
Each arm... 2 points. Each knee, 2 points each.

424
00:23:33,532 --> 00:23:36,532
Okay, that makes sense. Got it.

425
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:40,032
Elizabeth! Gigi! Time for you dirtbags to beat the snot out of each other!

426
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,032
Ah, yes! Huzzah! Alright, Gigi, let's put on our blindfold.

427
00:23:43,032 --> 00:23:45,032
For... alright.

428
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:47,032
Do it! Blindfold, blindfold!

429
00:23:47,032 --> 00:23:50,032
Okay, thank you.

430
00:23:50,032 --> 00:23:53,032
Hey, hey, hey, I got it, I got it, I got it.

431
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:56,532
Okay, you ready? Alright, okay, ready.

432
00:23:56,532 --> 00:23:58,532
Believe in yourself, believe in yourself.

433
00:23:58,532 --> 00:24:02,032
I believe in myself! Okay, no way, I'm gonna guide you.

434
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:05,532
I'll guide you, yeah, okay, okay. And be careful.

435
00:24:05,532 --> 00:24:09,032
I choose you, Gigi-mon! When do we spin?

436
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,532
When do we spin? We spin?

437
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:14,532
You can do it, you are the queen, you are the leader! Ready?

438
00:24:15,532 --> 00:24:18,032
Grab... ready? Set?

439
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:21,032
Spin to win! Okay, one!

440
00:24:21,032 --> 00:24:22,532
Two!

441
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:24,032
Three!

442
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:25,532
Four!

443
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:27,532
Five!

444
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,032
Okay, basta, okay, okay. That's it, that's it.

445
00:24:30,032 --> 00:24:33,032
Right in front of you, a little bit more!

446
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:36,532
Okay, well you have to walk like six steps.

447
00:24:36,532 --> 00:24:40,532
I have the power of anime on my side!

448
00:24:40,532 --> 00:24:43,032
No, that's me, wait, wait, wait.

449
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:45,532
Don't worry, left, left, turn to the left, turn to the left!

450
00:24:45,532 --> 00:24:48,032
Attack, attack, attack!

451
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:50,032
There she is, there she is! Yes, you got her!

452
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:52,532
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Roll away, roll away!

453
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,532
Yes, Liz, go! She's on the ground, she's on the ground!

454
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:58,032
On the ground! Get up! On your left, on your left, on your left!

455
00:24:58,032 --> 00:25:00,032
Okay, on your left! Okay, left!

456
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,340
Okay, okay!

457
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,240
Ready?

458
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,540
Go, go, go, go, go!

459
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,240
Got that! Gracias! Yeah!

460
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,540
You almost got it!

461
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,740
What am I hitting?!

462
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
What am I hitting?!

463
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,440
That's one!

464
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,140
That's two!

465
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,840
That's three!

466
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,340
You're doing really well!

467
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,840
What am I hitting?!

468
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,240
You're doing really well! Ow!

469
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,340
What am I hitting anymore?!

470
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,140
Okay, okay!

471
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,540
You did it!

472
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,740
I don't... I don't know...

473
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,440
You did it! You did it! You did it! Yeah!

474
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,740
I think you absolutely destroyed her!

475
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,240
Well well well, looks like you numbnuts managed to scrape up 15 points in round 1.

476
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,740
15 points!

477
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,540
Yeah!

478
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,840
15 points!

479
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,040
15 points! Definitely a win!

480
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,240
I'm a winner!

481
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,640
So good! Yeah!

482
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,240
15 points! Hey! Amazing!

483
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,040
Yeah, 15 points!

484
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,840
Yeah, 15, not 50!

485
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,040
Oh, alright! 15 points!

486
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,840
Alright, alright, gear up for Round 2!

487
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,540
Okay, okay, okay!

488
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,540
Give us...

489
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,040
...the blue!

490
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,040
Blue!

491
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,040
Wait, is Raora-chi cheating?

492
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,140
What?! No, I'm not!

493
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,240
Turn around, turn around!

494
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,840
Alright, let's put your...

495
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,440
...blindfolds on.

496
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,540
Okay, help me please!

497
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,240
Alright!

498
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,840
Oh, alright, let's put your...

499
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,340
...blindfolds on.

500
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,540
Keep looking at me. Perfect.

501
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
Is it on?

502
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,840
Yes, it's on! Okay!

503
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,940
Put your blindfold on.

504
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,140
Okay, can you see anything?

505
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
What? Okay, watch this!

506
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,340
I'm ready!

507
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,840
There you go.

508
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,240
Okay, I'm ready!

509
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,540
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

510
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,540
Took you buttercups long enough. Now square up!

511
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,740
Alright!

512
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,040
We're over here!

513
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,340
Gigi, count us down!

514
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,740
I'm gonna do a countdown!

515
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,240
Three!

516
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,340
Two!

517
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
One!

518
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,240
Spin!

519
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,640
One!

520
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,940
And two!

521
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,840
Faster!

522
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,540
Two!

523
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,340
Faster!

524
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,240
Three!

525
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,340
Faster, faster! And four!

526
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,740
Faster!

527
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,740
And five!

528
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Okay!

529
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,140
Go! Left Raora, left!

530
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,540
Left, left! To your left!

531
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,840
Left! Forward!

532
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,440
Straight! She's bent over, she's bent over!

533
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,740
Stop! On the ground!

534
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,240
Stop! Over that way!

535
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,740
Behind! Okay! Up!

536
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,340
Behind you! Behind you!

537
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,640
Where did she go?! Cecilia! Where did she go?!

538
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,040
Don't follow me!

539
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,540
Raora, straight ahead! Straight ahead! Straight ahead!

540
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,940
Going right! Straight! Straight!

541
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,840
Keep going straight! Straight! Keep going straight!

542
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,240
Get her! Get her!

543
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,840
Low, low, low! Go low! Go low!

544
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,640
Go lower! Go low!

545
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,440
Go low! Go low!

546
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,540
Forward! Forward! Stay where you are!

547
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,040
Okay, now, now, now, now!

548
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,540
Get her! Get her!

549
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,140
Oh gosh! Who am I hitting?! Who's hitting?!

550
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,940
I can't understand what you're saying!

551
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,840
Forward! Straight! Straight!

552
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,440
Go! Go! Okay, okay, okay!

553
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,340
Wait, wait! Don't hit me!

554
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,740
Raora, forward! Get her!

555
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,340
Raora, get her! Get her!

556
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,040
Oh, oh my gosh!

557
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,540
That was... that was something!

558
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,240
That was...

559
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,840
Gigi, score!

560
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,140
15 points!

561
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
Alright! That was very dizzy, I'm dizzy, I'm dizzy!

562
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,640
I am... I am scared of the darkness!

563
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,840
It is okay. You're still my pretty kitty. You did good, my pretty kitty. Mrow!

564
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:02,140
Your third trial is behind that door. What's the password?!

565
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,440
Oh really? Let's say it!

566
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,540
All together! All together!

567
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,440
Okay!

568
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,340
Alright!

569
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,040
8-8-0-0-8!

570
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,740
Open!

571
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,540
Fancy! It's very fancy!

572
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,340
Whoa!

573
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
Wow! So cool!

574
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,640
So cool! Yes!

575
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,940
So cool! Yeah!

576
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,040
Let's go, everyone! Huzzah!

577
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,540
At attention, you dogs! It's time for your third trial!

578
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,240
Uh oh.

579
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,540
What... what... what?

580
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,340
Oh no, no, no, no!

581
00:28:48,440 --> 00:29:02,140
Wait, wait, wait a second. No one said anything about a life-threat challenge!

582
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,240
Okay, so number one!

583
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:09,140
Balance the blocks while stacking them according to the color order on the instructions!

584
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:15,540
There are 5 levels, and you earn the same number of points as the level you clear!

585
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,340
But watch out! The higher the level, the tougher the challenge!

586
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,540
If you mess up the placement, the bomb explodes! It's game over!

587
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,040
So yeah, you lose. Game over.

588
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,440
Whoa!

589
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,140
Alright, who's ready to get SMOKED?

590
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,040
Well, Gigi, do you want to go first?

591
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,040
Die?

592
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,240
I will take the first bomb!

593
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,840
You ready to die?

594
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,040
I will die for Justice! For Justice!

595
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:10,040
Speed Block: Tick-Tock Takedown! 爆発回避！スピードブロック
Speed Block: Tick-Tock Takedown!

596
00:30:00,573 --> 00:30:02,548
Yeah! Justice for Justice!

597
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:04,548
Gigi! Justice for Justice!

598
00:30:04,548 --> 00:30:06,548
Let's go, Gigi!

599
00:30:06,548 --> 00:30:09,148
Gigi, you're amazing, look at you!

600
00:30:09,148 --> 00:30:14,648
You got 10 seconds to survive levels 1 and 2, then 30 seconds for levels 3 through 5.

601
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:12,548
Oh, she's gonna sacrifice for us.

602
00:30:12,548 --> 00:30:14,648
That's so incredible.

603
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:16,448
10 seconds. Can you count?

604
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:19,448
That's nine more than one.

605
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:21,448
You've got this, Gigi! You've got this!

606
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:23,748
We can count to ten for you, okay?

607
00:30:23,748 --> 00:30:26,548
Ten times one, guys.

608
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:29,048
Can you, can you count to ten?

609
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:33,848
You at home, can you count?

610
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:36,748
One, two...

611
00:30:36,748 --> 00:30:38,248
No, no, not yet! It's not time!

612
00:30:38,248 --> 00:30:40,548
Okay, okay, calm down, let's start.

613
00:30:40,848 --> 00:30:41,548
Gigi, ready?

614
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,548
I'm ready!

615
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:43,748
Okay, Gigi, go!

616
00:30:43,748 --> 00:30:47,348
Three, two, one, go!

617
00:30:48,048 --> 00:30:48,848
Level 1

618
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:52,548
Oh, look at... it's blue and you... it's red...

619
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:54,048
Raora thought she was purple!

620
00:30:54,048 --> 00:30:55,348
I am the purple!

621
00:30:55,348 --> 00:30:56,848
Okay, okay, okay!

622
00:30:56,848 --> 00:30:58,248
Okay, easy, easy.

623
00:30:58,248 --> 00:31:00,648
Ah, good job! Good job!

624
00:31:09,748 --> 00:31:11,848
Level 2

625
00:31:11,848 --> 00:31:13,548
Okay, yellow, blue, green, go!

626
00:31:13,548 --> 00:31:17,348
Oh, oh, oh, look at her go, all that gear!

627
00:31:17,348 --> 00:31:21,048
No way, it's impossible! Four seconds, four seconds!

628
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:24,748
Oh no! Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh!

629
00:31:24,748 --> 00:31:28,948
They're so far away from each other! What? But we always believed in you!

630
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:30,548
Level 3

631
00:31:30,548 --> 00:31:32,548
Go Gigi, go Gigi! Go Gigi!

632
00:31:32,548 --> 00:31:34,748
Red! Hey, this one you will have to do like a thingy at the end.

633
00:31:34,748 --> 00:31:36,548
Yellow, okay, okay, okay.

634
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:38,248
Purple, okay, okay, okay.

635
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:39,848
She's doing it!

636
00:31:39,848 --> 00:31:42,148
White! Wow!

637
00:31:42,148 --> 00:31:43,848
Now, pose to disarm the bomb!!

638
00:31:43,848 --> 00:31:46,048
Oh now pose! Oh! Wait!

639
00:31:46,048 --> 00:31:48,548
Hey, that's pretty good!

640
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:50,548
Oh! For ten seconds! You gotta keep it!

641
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:52,548
Keep it! Keep it!

642
00:31:52,548 --> 00:31:57,848
Six, five, four, three, two, one!

643
00:31:57,848 --> 00:32:03,548
Wow! Good job Gigi! That was really good! Beautiful!

644
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:06,448
Well, good job, good job!

645
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:07,548
Level 4

646
00:32:07,548 --> 00:32:09,548
Oh, that's a difficult one.

647
00:32:09,548 --> 00:32:11,348
Wait, you put purple on... why'd the ghost do that?

648
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:13,548
You're doing great, you're doing great.

649
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:15,548
This is not shape accuracy! Look at her doing it!

650
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:17,548
That's my Gigi. It's really good.

651
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:20,048
Disarm the bomb with a tongue twister!

652
00:32:19,848 --> 00:32:24,548
One-one was a race horse, two-two was one too, one-one won one race, two-two won one too.

653
00:32:24,548 --> 00:32:30,948
Oh! She did it! Good job Gigi! Nice one Gigi!

654
00:32:31,248 --> 00:32:32,348
Level 5

655
00:32:32,348 --> 00:32:34,148
Wait, what? Holy moly!

656
00:32:34,148 --> 00:32:36,848
Why'd they put this one so far?

657
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:38,548
20 seconds is a long time.

658
00:32:38,548 --> 00:32:41,048
You can do it! You can make it!

659
00:32:41,048 --> 00:32:43,348
Can I? What is this?

660
00:32:43,348 --> 00:32:45,348
The... oh, she's doing it, she's doing it.

661
00:32:45,348 --> 00:32:48,348
Oh, she's doing really well! Go Gigi, go!

662
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:50,548
10 seconds! One more color!

663
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:53,048
Wait, blue? Okay.

664
00:32:53,048 --> 00:32:57,648
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one...

665
00:32:57,848 --> 00:32:59,048
7 x 7 - 7 x 1 x 2 = ?

666
00:32:59,048 --> 00:33:00,648
Wait! Four...

667
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:06,048
Oh my god! Gigi! Are you okay?

668
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:10,048
Gigi! Gigi! Are you okay, Gigi?

669
00:33:10,048 --> 00:33:13,548
Yeah, she died for Justice! Gigi no! Gigi!

670
00:33:13,548 --> 00:33:17,548
Gigi? Gigi, are you okay? Gigi?

671
00:33:17,548 --> 00:33:22,548
Don't worry, she's just being mean to you. It's okay. You're gonna be fine.

672
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:26,548
Wah! Stop! Oh my god! Stop!

673
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:30,048
What happened to you? Unfair! That's unfair!

674
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:33,548
How do you do math in two seconds? That's unfair! Quick math! Quick math!

675
00:33:33,548 --> 00:33:35,848
Hey, you did amazing though. You did so well.

676
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:43,748
Justice for Justice! It's okay, you did... Gigi? Gigi, what are you doing?

677
00:33:44,248 --> 00:33:47,348
Smells like a barbecue in here. You got 10 points!

678
00:33:47,348 --> 00:33:50,548
Ten?! I didn't even count that high! Ten!

679
00:33:50,548 --> 00:33:55,348
Ten times one, that's ten. Wow, that's... Can you? Okay.

680
00:33:55,348 --> 00:33:59,848
Oh, who's next? Someone else is going to get blowed up, right?

681
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:03,548
That's enough, chatterboxes! You're up, Raora.

682
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:04,048
Raora! Okay, okay.

683
00:34:04,048 --> 00:34:07,548
I don't want to become a burn mess like Gigi! What? Whatever!

684
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:10,548
She's clean again! Yeah!

685
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:14,048
She licked herself clean! Oh, look at Gigi still licking. Look at that.

686
00:34:14,048 --> 00:34:18,548
You're back! So proud of you Gigi. I'm ready to defuse the bomb.

687
00:34:18,548 --> 00:34:24,048
You got this! We believe in you! You got this, Raora! Yay! Hahaha!

688
00:34:24,048 --> 00:34:30,048
First, Level 1! Okay, in three, two, one, go!

689
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:31,248
Level 1

690
00:34:32,048 --> 00:34:35,548
Light blue, easy, easy. Yellow, purple, got this.

691
00:34:35,548 --> 00:34:38,548
Tada! Ah, good job! Good job!

692
00:34:38,548 --> 00:34:40,148
Okay, easy.

693
00:34:40,448 --> 00:34:41,548
Level 2

694
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:42,548
Whoa! Whoa, that's a lot of colors.

695
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:45,348
This is a big one! Gosh! White, yellow, purple...

696
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:50,548
Oh, oh, blue! Green! Red! Almost there, green!

697
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:54,048
Yay! Good job Raora!

698
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:56,548
I knew Smokey was nice. Of course he is.

699
00:34:56,848 --> 00:34:57,848
Level 3

700
00:34:56,548 --> 00:35:00,048
All the colors! Whoa! Purple...

701
00:35:00,376 --> 00:35:02,056
Okay, put it on top, put it on top.

702
00:35:02,171 --> 00:35:03,556
You have a lot of time, don't worry.

703
00:35:04,306 --> 00:35:05,456
Raora, you have a lot of time.

704
00:35:05,706 --> 00:35:08,556
Got this, she got this! She got this, she got this!

705
00:35:10,056 --> 00:35:11,056
Now, pose to disarm the bomb!!!

706
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:12,556
If you had to do a full on...

707
00:35:13,576 --> 00:35:14,856
Way too many for my leg!

708
00:35:15,206 --> 00:35:16,456
You just do the pose.

709
00:35:16,606 --> 00:35:18,456
You can do whatever pose you want!

710
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:20,556
What? What? What?

711
00:35:20,876 --> 00:35:21,856
Okay!

712
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,556
I was trying to make her do those poses, huh?

713
00:35:27,276 --> 00:35:30,056
Yeah, was it you? Yeah, very cute.

714
00:35:30,876 --> 00:35:32,856
Oh, I'm in the way, I'm in the way.

715
00:35:33,606 --> 00:35:34,856
And time we can huddle.

716
00:35:38,976 --> 00:35:40,456
No! Wrong color.

717
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:42,556
Wait, that's the wrong color. Wrong color.

718
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:45,056
Oh, she got this, she got this!

719
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:46,256
She got this, she got this!

720
00:35:46,406 --> 00:35:48,556
Disarm the bomb with a tongue twister!

721
00:35:49,306 --> 00:35:51,256
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck,

722
00:35:52,576 --> 00:35:55,256
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

723
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:02,556
Pink. We don't need pink

724
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:03,856
when we're catching criminals.

725
00:36:04,176 --> 00:36:05,856
Oh yeah, that's so many colors.

726
00:36:07,176 --> 00:36:08,556
Okay, that's a lot of color.

727
00:36:10,176 --> 00:36:12,256
Yellow, yellow, black, blue.

728
00:36:12,376 --> 00:36:14,556
You're almost there! Almost did it!

729
00:36:15,176 --> 00:36:16,856
No, dark blue. Wait, dark blue.

730
00:36:18,606 --> 00:36:20,556
5 x 7 + 2 x 3 = ?

731
00:36:21,106 --> 00:36:22,856
35 plus 6 is 41!

732
00:36:23,606 --> 00:36:25,256
Whoa! She got that so quick!

733
00:36:25,606 --> 00:36:27,256
I'm so good at math.

734
00:36:27,606 --> 00:36:30,856
Whoa! My math question was so much shorter.

735
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,056
Big stamina means big brain!

736
00:36:37,606 --> 00:36:40,556
She did it! Ice cream for everyone!

737
00:36:40,706 --> 00:36:43,556
Pat-pat-pat-pat-pat-pat-pat...

738
00:36:44,306 --> 00:36:46,856
Raora scored 15 points. Not bad for a blockhead.

739
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:50,556
15! Whoo! 15 points!

740
00:36:51,606 --> 00:36:53,056
Good job, Ra-ba.

741
00:36:53,306 --> 00:36:56,556
Thanks. Yatta! Yatta!

742
00:36:57,306 --> 00:36:58,556
Who's ready to get lit up next?

743
00:36:59,106 --> 00:37:01,556
Okay, I'm all fired up, I'm ready!

744
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:03,456
Stop fighting, okay!

745
00:37:03,576 --> 00:37:05,456
Okay, okay! You know what, shut up!

746
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:07,056
I have to huddle down, please.

747
00:37:07,606 --> 00:37:10,556
Three, two, one, GO!

748
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,256
Wait, it's a traffic cone.

749
00:37:14,606 --> 00:37:16,856
Go, Cece, go! Go, go, go!

750
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:18,556
Whoa, she's so fast!

751
00:37:19,206 --> 00:37:20,556
It's like a candy.

752
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:23,556
That's hard to balance, it's hard to balance.

753
00:37:25,606 --> 00:37:27,456
Go, Cece, go! Okay, purple.

754
00:37:27,606 --> 00:37:29,556
Candy corn. That's too many.

755
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,556
That's okay. Purple, yellow.

756
00:37:32,606 --> 00:37:35,556
White! You got it! Okay!

757
00:37:39,606 --> 00:37:41,256
Oh, that looks so yummy.

758
00:37:42,606 --> 00:37:44,256
Yeah, this looks like a grave.

759
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:46,556
Green, yellow, red. Nice blue...

760
00:37:46,906 --> 00:37:48,256
I can't... I'm colorblind!

761
00:37:49,206 --> 00:37:51,256
Cece! You got this! Go!

762
00:37:53,306 --> 00:37:54,556
Now, pose to disarm the bomb!!!

763
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,256
Oh, what's your pose?

764
00:37:56,406 --> 00:37:57,856
Pose on the left or the right?

765
00:37:58,206 --> 00:37:59,256
Oh, I'm so relaxed.

766
00:37:59,406 --> 00:38:00,256
Namaste.

767
00:38:00,406 --> 00:38:02,556
Ten seconds! Now breathe in.

768
00:38:02,706 --> 00:38:04,556
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

769
00:38:04,706 --> 00:38:06,556
And now breathe in.

770
00:38:07,606 --> 00:38:11,556
Whoo! Whoo!

771
00:38:13,306 --> 00:38:14,556
Disarm the bomb with a tongue twister!

772
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:18,556
Red, pink, red, almost,

773
00:38:19,206 --> 00:38:20,556
yellow, I mean, black...

774
00:38:21,206 --> 00:38:23,556
Whoa, you're bringing over every single color!

775
00:38:24,206 --> 00:38:27,556
This strategy, this strategy. Balance, balance.

776
00:38:30,606 --> 00:38:33,256
The big black bug bit the big black bear,

777
00:38:33,406 --> 00:38:37,556
but the big black bear bit the big black bug back. YEAH!

778
00:38:40,606 --> 00:38:43,556
You're stuttering! Big... Go, go!

779
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:48,556
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

780
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:51,256
That was really fast! Go, Cece, go!

781
00:38:51,606 --> 00:38:54,556
She's doing it! White, white, blue...

782
00:38:55,206 --> 00:38:56,256
You win now!

783
00:38:57,206 --> 00:38:58,556
Whoa! It's crumbling down.

784
00:38:59,606 --> 00:39:01,856
Okay, okay, okay, she did it.

785
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,256
Oh, that's black. Oh my god.

786
00:39:04,606 --> 00:39:07,556
Oh my god, it's so over. Oh no!

787
00:39:08,206 --> 00:39:10,556
Colors! I'm colorblind!

788
00:39:11,206 --> 00:39:13,556
I'm colorblind! I'm colorblind!

789
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,556
Whoa! Whoa! Cece!

790
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:23,856
Wait, you can't see me, right?

791
00:39:24,206 --> 00:39:26,556
I love zombies. Cece!

792
00:39:26,706 --> 00:39:28,556
Did you look... Did you look?

793
00:39:29,206 --> 00:39:33,056
Open your eyes! You've got to face your fear!

794
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,856
Nice and smokey... 10 points!

795
00:39:37,606 --> 00:39:39,556
I got ten! Whoo!

796
00:39:41,606 --> 00:39:44,256
Can you count to ten?

797
00:39:45,606 --> 00:39:48,556
How many fingers am I holding up?

798
00:39:49,206 --> 00:39:53,056
At least four. At least. Twelve!

799
00:39:53,606 --> 00:39:54,856
Cool! Queen!

800
00:39:55,206 --> 00:39:57,256
Lead of Justice, lead of Justice.

801
00:39:57,606 --> 00:39:59,556
Okay, on this chance. Ha!

802
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,864
Justice! Justice!

803
00:40:01,997 --> 00:40:03,530
Show you what I'm made of!

804
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,064
Asazzz!

805
00:40:05,164 --> 00:40:06,897
All right, all right.

806
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,630
Fast. Okay.

807
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,864
I didn't get to the... All right.

808
00:40:10,864 --> 00:40:12,497
We're gonna make it even sooner.

809
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:14,697
Oh, these blocks are quite far away. Um...

810
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,897
All right, let's let us put them.

811
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:20,597
I'm ready! Ha! Bring it on! Bring it on!

812
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,097
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yes!

813
00:40:21,097 --> 00:40:23,297
Are you ready, Liz? We're gonna count down for you, okay?

814
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:24,797
I'm ready!

815
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,630
All right. Level 1.

816
00:40:26,897 --> 00:40:30,864
Yeah. 3... 2... 1... Go!

817
00:40:31,964 --> 00:40:34,330
Ooh, that's easy! Come on, come on! You got this!

818
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:37,530
Okay, she got it, she got it. She got it.

819
00:40:37,864 --> 00:40:39,797
Oh, the black one... That's so far away.

820
00:40:40,097 --> 00:40:44,097
She got it, she got it, she got it! Woo! All right! Yeah!

821
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:46,397
Aha! Level 2!

822
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,397
Ooh! Uh-oh.

823
00:40:48,497 --> 00:40:50,897
Okay, okay. No, no, that one's good!

824
00:40:50,897 --> 00:40:53,130
Fast! The blue's! Ahhh!

825
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:56,630
No, that one's there, that one's there. Oh! Yay!

826
00:40:57,164 --> 00:41:01,897
All right! Yes! Ah! Oh-ho-ho! Yeah!

827
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,330
Level 3! Ooh!

828
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:07,797
Oh, that... That's a pyramid! That pyramid scream!

829
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,197
You got this!

830
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:12,230
I'll tell you and then you sell it... Or she's almost got it.

831
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,397
Wait, wait, where? Go! Red! Where's red?

832
00:41:13,297 --> 00:41:15,597
There! There! There! She got it, she got it!

833
00:41:15,697 --> 00:41:18,464
Wait! What are we doing? What are we doing? Whoa, whoa, whoa!

834
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,597
Okay! Now pose to disarm!

835
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:22,197
Oh! Yeah!

836
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,830
This pose does not seem fair!

837
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,064
Yeah, this pose... Any cool pose.

838
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,864
Ooh! Ah! Show us your coolest pose.

839
00:41:29,997 --> 00:41:34,564
Oh wow, we get yoga and they just get to do whatever they want.
Yoga? They get photoshoot.

840
00:41:35,397 --> 00:41:38,330
Oh gosh! Why are they so far away? Yeah!

841
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:40,864
Got it! Okay, she got it, she got it.

842
00:41:41,297 --> 00:41:43,830
Nice, pink! Got it! Oh, she's got it!

843
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,464
Go fast! That's our queen! That's our queen!

844
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:48,464
Level 4. All right!

845
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,130
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.

846
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,430
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.

847
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,364
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?

848
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,497
Was he?

849
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,330
Whoa! Yay! I'm glad you won, we...!

850
00:41:57,864 --> 00:41:59,664
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.

851
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:01,364
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.

852
00:42:01,397 --> 00:42:04,330
Fuzzy Wuzzy... I can't remember the rest.

853
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:08,630
Boots and cats and boots and cats
And boots and cats and boots and cats...

854
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,497
Fuzzy Wuzzy, he was a bear, didn't see him anywhere.

855
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:15,597
Yeah, I'm the Queen of Justice and... uh, what rhymes with Justice?

856
00:42:15,597 --> 00:42:19,497
That's Just! You know what rhymes with Justice? Think about it.

857
00:42:19,497 --> 00:42:22,564
Just... ice. Out of here! Yeah, just ice.

858
00:42:22,797 --> 00:42:25,497
All right! Okay, okay, okay, okay. Difficult.

859
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,864
Ah! This light one!

860
00:42:30,864 --> 00:42:34,697
And then I need the pink one and the blue one...
Wait, no, I don't need this blue one! Get out of here!

861
00:42:34,797 --> 00:42:36,630
Purple! Light blue!

862
00:42:35,864 --> 00:42:38,330
Go, you got it, you got it!

863
00:42:36,764 --> 00:42:40,630
I need this one! I need this one! And I need purple!

864
00:42:41,397 --> 00:42:44,297
No! No! Everything's falling apart!

865
00:42:44,397 --> 00:42:47,530
No! No, it's not falling apart!
No, you can do it, you can still do it!

866
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,097
Did I get it?

867
00:42:49,197 --> 00:42:51,364
No! Get it on! I missed it! No!

868
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,797
Oh! No! Ahhh!

869
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,497
What the freak?

870
00:42:57,597 --> 00:43:00,730
No! Get out of here, get out of here. That's fine.

871
00:43:00,797 --> 00:43:03,530
I mean, yeah, that's fine. Well, whatever.

872
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,230
It's... I got to Level 5.

873
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,197
Kick them, kick them!

874
00:43:05,297 --> 00:43:06,630
Get out your anger! Kick them!

875
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:08,630
I didn't want to do math anyway. It's fine.

876
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,630
I didn't want to do math anyway, it's fine, it's fine. No.

877
00:43:10,764 --> 00:43:12,764
I got some math for you... 10 points!

878
00:43:12,864 --> 00:43:15,930
Really? 10 points! Yeah!

879
00:43:16,164 --> 00:43:18,564
Woo! Asazzz!

880
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,964
I think that was pretty good, I think that was pretty good.

881
00:43:24,064 --> 00:43:26,564
Simmer down, buttercups! You still got the final trial!

882
00:43:26,697 --> 00:43:30,230
Quizzes and tests? We don't want to do math anymore!

883
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,530
We just want to relax, Smokey.

884
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,264
Oh, I'm getting tired.

885
00:43:38,264 --> 00:43:41,430
Ice cream, ice cream. Let's go. I want ice cream now. Bye!

886
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,830
Wait, what the freak?

887
00:43:43,964 --> 00:43:46,397
Hey! Hey! Hey! I'm the only one still burnt up.

888
00:43:46,497 --> 00:43:49,930
Hey, can I go... can I go shower real quick before the next... next game?

889
00:43:50,764 --> 00:43:52,730
Uh... Hello?

890
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:54,497
Hello?

891
00:44:29,064 --> 00:44:32,464
Taking you up a load, taking you orby...

892
00:44:33,064 --> 00:44:34,264
Ha ha!

893
00:44:34,397 --> 00:44:36,530
All right, I'm all showered up.

894
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:40,464
I don't smell like a cheeky chicken... well, burnt cheeky chicken anymore.

895
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,397
Oh, maybe they're hiding. Hehe.

896
00:44:45,397 --> 00:44:47,397
All right, I know a way to bring them out.

897
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,364
Justice... Just... Like... That!

898
00:44:51,364 --> 00:44:54,697
Justice! Justice!

899
00:44:54,697 --> 00:44:57,497
You were hiding this whole time!

900
00:44:58,297 --> 00:45:00,064
Oh goodness. Hello, pretty kitties!

901
00:45:05,222 --> 00:45:07,197
It's time for the final trial, twerps!

902
00:45:07,197 --> 00:45:08,572
Cecilia, rules!

903
00:45:09,172 --> 00:45:10,572
Okay! Yes sir.

904
00:45:11,122 --> 00:45:13,272
The final trial is...

905
00:45:13,272 --> 00:45:15,572
Hammer of Justice! Whack-a-Gnome.

906
00:45:15,872 --> 00:45:17,872
Gnome? Whack-a-gnome.

907
00:45:18,222 --> 00:45:19,872
Okay, here are the rules.

908
00:45:20,172 --> 00:45:23,572
Number one. Defeat the evil gnomes emerging from the wall...

909
00:45:23,572 --> 00:45:27,272
...by striking them with a giant hammer!

910
00:45:28,222 --> 00:45:31,322
Number two. As we've all learned...

911
00:45:31,322 --> 00:45:33,472
...not all gnomes are bad!

912
00:45:33,472 --> 00:45:36,572
Some are friendly, some are nice.

913
00:45:36,572 --> 00:45:40,572
So be careful not to hit the good ones and only hit the bad ones!

914
00:45:40,922 --> 00:45:44,272
And then, if you smash the bad gnomes, you get three points.

915
00:45:44,272 --> 00:45:48,072
And if you hit the good gnomes, you get minus three points.

916
00:45:48,072 --> 00:45:52,572
Okay so we're supposed to hit the bad ones. Right, okay. I'll just know.

917
00:45:53,472 --> 00:45:57,072
Be careful to aim carefully. And then at the end...

918
00:45:57,072 --> 00:46:00,872
How many points can you score in thirty seconds?

919
00:46:02,872 --> 00:46:06,572
They come out of the holes and then you have to hit them.

920
00:46:06,572 --> 00:46:11,172
There's good gnomes and bad gnomes. Are you a bad gnome? I just can't tell.

921
00:46:12,172 --> 00:46:15,422
Here's the bad dude you gotta feed to the worms!

922
00:46:16,072 --> 00:46:18,572
Whoa! Sunglasses inside?

923
00:46:18,572 --> 00:46:21,072
Sunglasses means they're bad ones.

924
00:46:22,222 --> 00:46:25,422
And this is the good one. No friendly fire!

925
00:46:25,872 --> 00:46:29,572
Oh, that's a good one. Okay. So red hat, no sunglasses, good.

926
00:46:29,572 --> 00:46:33,472
Not to be gnomed. That's a good one. Not the sunglasses!

927
00:46:33,472 --> 00:46:37,072
Don't hit this one. Okay, okay, okay.

928
00:46:38,322 --> 00:46:41,072
Alright, put those muscles to work, big cat.

929
00:46:41,222 --> 00:46:43,572
I got this one guys, I got you, I got you.

930
00:46:50,072 --> 00:46:53,072
Oh, come on, pretty kitty, you can't weigh that much.

931
00:46:53,072 --> 00:46:56,072
It's gonna escalate to get you far. Come on, you can do it!

932
00:46:56,572 --> 00:46:58,572
Believe in me who believes in thee!

933
00:46:58,572 --> 00:47:03,072
Let my voice be your strength, pretty kitty! Use your God eyes! You've got this!

934
00:47:07,572 --> 00:47:10,572
I can do it! Raargh!

935
00:47:16,222 --> 00:47:17,872
Ready to roll?

936
00:47:18,072 --> 00:47:20,072
I am ready.

937
00:47:20,072 --> 00:47:23,072
I have the power of justice and cute girls.

938
00:47:23,072 --> 00:47:26,072
I can do it! You got this!

939
00:47:26,572 --> 00:47:30,272
Alright, it's time to Whack-a-Gnome! Are you ready? Yes, I'm ready!

940
00:47:30,872 --> 00:47:35,072
Three! Two! One! Go!

941
00:47:44,272 --> 00:47:46,072
Kill the gnome! Kill the gnome!

942
00:47:59,272 --> 00:48:01,072
Why is there a cucumber?!

943
00:48:01,072 --> 00:48:04,272
Why is there a cucumber? What is the cucumber?!

944
00:48:09,172 --> 00:48:12,572
Oh geez... What was that? That was not a gnome!

945
00:48:12,572 --> 00:48:16,872
Ew. It was a weird green gnome, huh? Disgusting.

946
00:48:18,172 --> 00:48:21,872
Oopsie daisy... I forgot to mention hitting cucumbers give you 5 points per hit.

947
00:48:22,072 --> 00:48:25,572
What?! I feel like you should have said that earlier!

948
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:28,872
You got so many points then, probably. I hit it a bunch of times!

949
00:48:29,272 --> 00:48:33,072
Total scores will be tallied at the end of the game. Which one of you meatheads is next!? Move out!

950
00:48:33,272 --> 00:48:36,572
Who's next? Who's next? Who's next? Liz, I think it's your turn now.

951
00:48:36,572 --> 00:48:41,072
Oh, well, okay then. Let me just take off my jacket.

952
00:48:41,072 --> 00:48:46,572
Alright. Flame on! Let's go!

953
00:48:47,572 --> 00:48:49,872
Alright, let me go get the hammer over here.

954
00:48:50,322 --> 00:48:52,872
Time to earn your title, "leader"!

955
00:48:53,072 --> 00:48:55,372
Alright, are you ready Liz? I am ready.

956
00:48:56,572 --> 00:48:58,572
Okay. Countdown!

957
00:48:59,072 --> 00:49:02,072
Three, two, one, go!

958
00:49:37,372 --> 00:49:41,372
I feel bad about hitting those gnomes. My grandad has gnomes in his garden.

959
00:49:41,372 --> 00:49:45,072
You did amazing! Destroy them all. No, they're usually quite nice.

960
00:49:45,422 --> 00:49:48,872
Sympathy ain't gonna help you catch Advent! Gigi! Show no mercy.

961
00:49:48,872 --> 00:49:51,572
Okay, Gigi, are you ready? Okay.

962
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:54,072
Are you ready for this...? Kill all of the gnomes.

963
00:49:54,072 --> 00:50:00,072
Come over here and get the hammer. I left it... I'm gonna do it. There we go.

964
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,080
Man, she was heavy.

965
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,080
She's built for this.

966
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,080
She does this every day.

967
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,580
Oh, uh, I mean it's, you know, not as heavy as Thor's, so...

968
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,580
You can do this! Go!

969
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,580
Come on Gigi! Come on!

970
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,580
Alright, just lift with your legs. Lift with your legs.

971
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Let's go! Use your claws! Use your legs!

972
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,580
Well done, well done.

973
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,580
Oh my god, you're stronger than this.

974
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,580
Alright Gigi, good luck! Break a leg, or break a gnome in this case.

975
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:32,080
Alright, here we go. Three, two, one, start!

976
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,080
Whoa! Oh! No!

977
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:38,080
Gigi, Gigi, you're doing it wrong! Uh, Gigi...

978
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,580
Gigi, I don't think that's how it works.

979
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,580
Oh no, that's the wrong color! Gigi!

980
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,580
Just the- Just the purple ones! Take out the- The purple ones! Purple one! Just the purple one!

981
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,080
Oh well, she got the cucumber.

982
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,080
Oh, yeah, maybe that evens out.

983
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:02,080
Eh? Eh? Oh, what? What? Is it talking to her?

984
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:06,080
I know what I must do. I know what I must do.

985
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,580
Gigi? What are you doing? Why are you looking at me like this?

986
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:15,080
Gigi? No! Gigi! No, no, no, no, no! Hey, hey, hey! Gigi! No, no, no, no! What are you doing? No, no, no!

987
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,580
Hey! Someone help!

988
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,080
Why can't I hit her?

989
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,080
No! She's so good!

990
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,580
I should learn that. That seems like a good dodge move.

991
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,080
Ew!

992
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,580
Hey, what's wrong with the cucumber?

993
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,580
Disgusting! You must teach me that move sometime.

994
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,580
I will do that. Hey, when it jumps like that, it's- I don't know what happened.

995
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,580
I just lost consciousness.

996
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,580
That cucumber has consciousness. That was really impressive.

997
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,580
Thanks.

998
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:49,080
Button those lips! Cecilia! Get in there!

999
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,080
Okay, I'm ready!

1000
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,080
Avenge me.

1001
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,580
Oh wait, I need the hammer.

1002
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,580
Let's cheer for Ceci, okay?

1003
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:07,580
Okay, here we go! It's time to whack a gnome! All right! Three, two, one, go!

1004
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:16,080
You know what, Smokey? You know what you are doing to us the entire time? Yeah, you're trying to make us play games.

1005
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:23,080
But I'm not gonna play your games! I'm not gonna hammer up your gnomes! Because I do not discriminate! Bring it all on!

1006
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:28,080
You know what? I don't discriminate! Cucumber! He's on a period! He's on a period!

1007
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,080
Oh, he's on a period?

1008
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:37,080
Die! Got it! You got it!

1009
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,080
Go, go, go, go!

1010
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,580
Sorry, sorry.

1011
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:51,080
I've had enough. I've had enough, Smokey! You're pitting us against each other, but we will not play your games any longer!

1012
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:56,580
We'll happily play your games. No, no it's just- it's just a joke, you know. How funny, you know.

1013
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:03,080
We have humor too, not just strength. But uh... are you okay?

1014
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:09,580
Goin' AWOL, huh? 0 points, you slug!

1015
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:15,580
Oh, I don't want any more! You make us so sport the entire time! I'm sick of this!

1016
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,580
Enough of you!

1017
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,580
It's okay.

1018
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,080
I rock you. It's okay.

1019
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,080
Why do you keep bullying us, Smokey?

1020
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,080
Silence somehow! Can we escalate this?

1021
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,580
Wait, we need to stop this! Stop! Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop!

1022
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,080
She hit me!

1023
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,580
I'm sorry Smokey! We'll make sure that this is not gonna happen again!

1024
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:47,080
We're sorry! We're sorry! We're sorry! We're sorry!

1025
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:52,580
I'm sorry! Don't work the highest score! Please!

1026
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:58,580
Just tell us! Tell us, Smokey! Come on! Come on, end this pain!

1027
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,580
After four trials, one of you clowns came out on top...

1028
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:08,080
The winner is... Raora Panthera! You win, cupcake!

1029
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:14,580
Yay! This is great! I'm a pretty kitty!

RENEGADE
Lyrics: monii / Music: Gimgigam, monii / Arrangement: Gimgigam

1043
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:09,988
Paint the picture and fall before my justice,

1044
00:55:09,988 --> 00:55:12,488
final warning you know my rage is limitless,

1045
00:55:14,088 --> 00:55:16,488
on the advent of a new genesis

1046
00:55:16,488 --> 00:55:19,488
I'm infamous, yeah I get a little villainous.

1047
00:55:20,388 --> 00:55:23,188
Look into my eyes, I'll seek you out

1048
00:55:23,188 --> 00:55:26,388
reveal the true from lies that you just can't hide.

1049
00:55:27,288 --> 00:55:29,988
Flying at the walls, I feel these sick temptations

1050
00:55:29,988 --> 00:55:32,888
what do I have to sacrifice?

1051
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:36,288
Bound by your chains, desiring to do it my way

1052
00:55:36,288 --> 00:55:39,288
this hurricane of a devastating force is coming

1053
00:55:39,788 --> 00:55:43,088
out of the maze, feel my voltage rising and igniting

1054
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:45,388
fire, snuff it out.

1055
00:55:46,588 --> 00:55:48,588
Walking the line

1056
00:55:48,588 --> 00:55:52,488
on the edge of becoming what I never thought I'd be,

1057
00:55:52,488 --> 00:55:55,888
better, this stand is gonna take 'em all out,

1058
00:55:55,888 --> 00:55:57,488
renegade.

1059
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,388
Walking the line

1060
00:56:00,388 --> 00:56:04,088
fell so far into poison and I'm seeing me anew,

1061
00:56:05,688 --> 00:56:08,788
gotcha, locked and I'm loaded, take 'em all out,

1062
00:56:08,788 --> 00:56:10,388
renegade.

1063
00:56:10,388 --> 00:56:13,988
Just, just, just like that, I don't care at all,

1064
00:56:13,988 --> 00:56:17,288
up so deep though I can't quit, never gonna stop

1065
00:56:17,288 --> 00:56:18,788
cause I don't have a limit.

1066
00:56:18,788 --> 00:56:21,588
My moral compass is out of focus,

1067
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:24,288
renegade, I'll make it a little wicked.

1068
00:56:24,588 --> 00:56:26,488
The light goes out! Ha!

1069
00:56:26,488 --> 00:56:29,288
The light goes out! Ow!

1070
00:56:29,288 --> 00:56:33,188
The light goes out! Ha!

1071
00:56:33,788 --> 00:56:36,788
The light goes out! Ha!

1072
00:56:36,788 --> 00:56:38,488
The light goes out!

1073
00:56:44,188 --> 00:56:48,888
Make 'em fall down, make your last wish, make 'em make 'em fall down then they crack.

1074
00:56:48,888 --> 00:56:50,288
Renegade, I'll make 'em...

1075
00:56:50,288 --> 00:56:54,888
Make 'em fall down, make your last wish, make 'em make 'em fall down then they crack.

1076
00:56:54,888 --> 00:56:56,688
Renegade, I'll make 'em...

1077
00:56:56,688 --> 00:57:00,088
Fall by fall, and through the waters flooding,

1078
00:57:00,088 --> 00:57:03,088
never blinking, some of the sea go light up the way,

1079
00:57:03,088 --> 00:57:06,588
spinning move in the fallout, standing in the ashes,

1080
00:57:06,588 --> 00:57:08,588
far from you, snuff it out.

1081
00:57:09,788 --> 00:57:11,888
Walking the line

1082
00:57:11,888 --> 00:57:15,788
on the edge of becoming what I never thought I'd be,

1083
00:57:15,788 --> 00:57:19,288

1084
00:57:19,288 --> 00:57:21,088
renegade.

1085
00:57:22,288 --> 00:57:23,988
Walking the line

1086
00:57:23,988 --> 00:57:27,488

1087

Just, just, just like that, I don't care at all,

1090
00:57:37,588 --> 00:57:40,788
up so deep though I can't quit, never gonna stop

I hate this noise! It's an alarm! Oh no!

Huh? Is that FuwaMoco? Advent?

Oh! Ha! Ha!

1126
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:54,088
What do you think? If we go to the stage,

1127
00:59:54,088 --> 00:59:56,288
can we catch them?

1128
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:58,288
Mococo! Mococo!

1129
00:59:58,288 --> 01:00:00,088

Go, get out of my face! And make sure you catch Advent!

We'll give them a taste of their own medicine! Right, guys?

I've been here for five hours! Huzzah!

1141
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:35,096

We're here!

1143
01:00:36,596 --> 01:00:38,096

You're so quick!

1145
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:42,596
I thought you were here, I had to take a shower, you know.

1146
01:00:43,596 --> 01:00:45,096

I got here on time!

1150
01:00:51,096 --> 01:00:52,596

1151
01:00:52,596 --> 01:00:54,096
What? You see them?

1152
01:00:54,096 --> 01:00:55,096

01:00:56,296 --> 01:00:59,296
Aha! I see how it is. Well, you know...

Silly.

1155
01:01:00,596 --> 01:01:04,596

Lyrics: Steph Music: Carlos Okabe, Masaki Tomiyama

1237
01:05:35,504 --> 01:05:38,304
Just, sis, just like that

1238
01:05:38,304 --> 01:05:41,104
Just, sis, get, get the!

1239
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:44,604
Look at the horizon together as one

1240
01:05:44,604 --> 01:05:47,504
A star is on the rise and it's only begun

1241
01:05:48,104 --> 01:05:50,904
Capture the moment that we're clamoring for

1242
01:05:50,904 --> 01:05:54,104
An infinite future's right out the door

1243
01:05:54,604 --> 01:05:58,304
It's a timeless story with a new feel
Not just algorithm, it's real

1244
01:05:58,304 --> 01:06:01,304
Wake up, big dreams about to come true
That means it's time to break through

1245
01:06:01,904 --> 01:06:04,704
Never knew we could make it so far
Always striving, thriving, higher

1246
01:06:04,704 --> 01:06:08,104
Achieving the impossible
We're virtually unstoppable

1247
01:06:08,404 --> 01:06:10,904
Because through it all we just keep moving

1248
01:06:10,904 --> 01:06:14,104
Now everybody sing

1249
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:17,504
We're making our way to the next dimension

1250
01:06:17,504 --> 01:06:21,104
We'll reinvent the world that we live in

1251
01:06:21,104 --> 01:06:24,104
We'll greet every day with good intention

1252
01:06:24,104 --> 01:06:27,504
Break conventions, run right through

1253
01:06:27,704 --> 01:06:30,604
We're smashing barriers left and right

1254
01:06:30,604 --> 01:06:33,904
Soar past the other ways, stay in flight

1255
01:06:34,104 --> 01:06:37,104
So get together let's reunite

1256
01:06:37,104 --> 01:06:40,504
Reach out, reach out the future's bright

1257
01:06:40,904 --> 01:06:43,704
Even though together for it feels like eternity

1258
01:06:43,704 --> 01:06:46,904
The times are changing but we're ready for infinity

1259
01:06:47,104 --> 01:06:50,304
As far as I think I could go, far with me combined

1260
01:06:52,304 --> 01:06:54,904
So look at the horizon and then look beyond

1261
01:06:54,904 --> 01:06:58,304
We'll marvel at the sky and the strength of our bond

1262
01:06:58,504 --> 01:07:01,504
We're making a vow to the smiling stars

1263
01:07:01,504 --> 01:07:04,904
A powerful moment that's all of ours

1264
01:07:06,104 --> 01:07:08,604
The seasons change but we keep shining

1265
01:07:08,604 --> 01:07:11,304
Now everybody sing

1266
01:07:11,304 --> 01:07:12,504
Keep it going!

1267
01:07:12,504 --> 01:07:15,604
We're making our way to the next dimension

1268
01:07:15,604 --> 01:07:18,904
A million flows in every direction

1269
01:07:19,104 --> 01:07:22,104
We'll give every mile our full attention

1270
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:25,304
Breaking tension, breaking through

1271
01:07:25,504 --> 01:07:28,504
With endless energy, strong attire

1272
01:07:28,504 --> 01:07:31,504
A perfect harmony, reach even higher

1273
01:07:31,704 --> 01:07:34,704
So clap along with me, time to rise

1274
01:07:34,704 --> 01:07:38,104
The future's bright before our eyes

1275
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:41,604
A new dimension of freedom that we've found

1276
01:07:41,604 --> 01:07:44,304
Yeah, we've made it

1277
01:07:44,304 --> 01:07:47,504
We're breaking out of the monochrome bound

1278
01:07:47,504 --> 01:07:50,304
We're unlimited

1279
01:07:50,304 --> 01:07:53,504
We're gonna spring to life and break the chains

1280
01:07:53,504 --> 01:07:56,704
Turn up the hype, can't be contained

1281
01:07:56,904 --> 01:08:00,104
We're shaking up the status quo

1282
01:08:00,104 --> 01:08:03,304
No time to stop, we're good to go

1283
01:08:03,504 --> 01:08:06,104
The whole wide world is listening

1284
01:08:06,104 --> 01:08:09,104
So everybody sing!

1285
01:08:09,104 --> 01:08:12,504
We're making our way to the next dimension

1286
01:08:12,504 --> 01:08:15,704
We're living out the dreams we've believed in

1287
01:08:15,904 --> 01:08:18,904
Excitement beyond our comprehension

1288
01:08:18,904 --> 01:08:22,304
There's no question, we'll break through

1289
01:08:22,504 --> 01:08:25,504
For deep aspiring to excel

1290
01:08:25,504 --> 01:08:28,504
It's awe-inspiring, going well

1291
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:31,504
So light the fire and let's rebel

1292
01:08:31,504 --> 01:08:34,904
The future's bright as we can tell

1293
01:08:45,404 --> 01:08:48,404
Breaking Dimensions

1294
01:08:51,304 --> 01:08:53,104
Yeah!

1295
01:08:53,104 --> 01:08:55,504
And that's amazing job today!

1296
01:08:55,504 --> 01:08:58,604
You’ve conquered all the trials and performed at full force!

1297
01:08:58,604 --> 01:09:00,104
Yeah!

1298
01:09:00,104 --> 01:09:02,104
And what’s more, for the 3D!

1299
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:05,504
Justice! Just, sis! Just like that!

1300
01:09:05,504 --> 01:09:08,604
Just, sis! Get, get the!

1301
01:09:08,604 --> 01:09:10,104
Yeah!

1302
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:14,104
But we’re not done yet! We have not one, but two big announcements! Yeah!

1303
01:09:14,104 --> 01:09:16,604
First up, drumroll please...

1304
01:09:16,604 --> 01:09:21,104
Introducing the official Justice 3D Showcase Celebration merch!

1305
01:09:21,104 --> 01:09:24,104
Alright everyone, get into your merch positions!

1306
01:09:24,104 --> 01:09:26,604
Oh, merch positions, right!

1307
01:09:26,604 --> 01:09:28,604
Okay! First we have Sergeant Smokey’s design multi-case!

1308
01:09:28,604 --> 01:09:31,104
There it is! Here!

1309
01:09:31,104 --> 01:09:33,604
It’s a multi-case!

1310
01:09:33,604 --> 01:09:37,104
And if you also want to be Sergeant Smokey and boss us around...

1311
01:09:53,104 --> 01:09:59,104
Sergeant Smokey
Multi Case

1312
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:01,912
And then this is for you.

1313
01:10:01,913 --> 01:10:04,012
A handy item to store your favorite goodies.

1314
01:10:04,112 --> 01:10:06,012
On the left side, you can keep button badges and keychains.

1315
01:10:06,312 --> 01:10:08,912
The right side fits small acrylic stands or postcards.

1316
01:10:09,112 --> 01:10:12,612
Yay!

1317
01:10:13,312 --> 01:10:15,612
There's also a hook on the back to attach even more keychains.

1318
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:18,612
And we'd be so happy if you show off our merch at events, please.

1319
01:10:19,112 --> 01:10:20,612
Thank you so much!

1320
01:10:20,712 --> 01:10:23,112
Yay! Yay!

1321
01:10:23,212 --> 01:10:25,112
Alright, Raora, your turn. Next.

1322
01:10:25,612 --> 01:10:26,612
My turn? Hmm.

1323
01:10:27,612 --> 01:10:29,612
Alright everyone, next star, next one is...

1324
01:10:29,712 --> 01:10:33,312
...the large-size 3D acrylic stand!

1325
01:10:33,612 --> 01:10:36,612
Life-size! Whoo! Life-size, baby!

1326
01:10:37,112 --> 01:10:40,112
I don't even know if I'm life-size.

1327
01:10:40,212 --> 01:10:42,612
Justice's life-size! I was like whoa.

1328
01:10:43,112 --> 01:10:46,612
I don't even know if after I repeated it and I was like, "Wait, life-size?"

1329
01:10:47,112 --> 01:10:50,112
Big card means big acrylic!

1330
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:53,112
Oh yeah! Big acrylic! Life-size!

1331
01:10:54,112 --> 01:10:57,612
In fact, Justice is coming to life as 3D acrylic stands.

1332
01:10:58,112 --> 01:10:59,612
Everyone loves acrylic stands, right?

1333
01:11:00,112 --> 01:11:02,612
Yeah, I love them. I love them.

1334
01:11:03,112 --> 01:11:05,612
So whether you have a room dedicated to acrylic stands...

1335
01:11:05,712 --> 01:11:08,112
...or just starting your collection...

1336
01:11:08,212 --> 01:11:10,112
...you are going to need all of Justice, okay?

1337
01:11:10,212 --> 01:11:12,612
Get them all!

1338
01:11:12,712 --> 01:11:15,112
All of them! All of them! Oh!

1339
01:11:15,612 --> 01:11:17,112
Goon! Next one!

1340
01:11:17,212 --> 01:11:20,112
Oh, it's me! Okay.

1341
01:11:21,112 --> 01:11:25,112
And as we all mentioned during our 3D showcases,

1342
01:11:25,212 --> 01:11:27,612
we each have our own merch too. Oh-la-la!

1343
01:11:28,112 --> 01:11:31,612
Alright then, I will start.

1344
01:11:32,112 --> 01:11:35,612
This right here is the paper knife and acrylic stand.

1345
01:11:35,712 --> 01:11:39,112
It's a lovely set inspired by the design of my sword, Thorn.

1346
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:44,112
Yay!

1347
01:11:45,112 --> 01:11:49,112
This paper knife can actually be displayed by resting it on the acrylic stand.

1348
01:11:49,212 --> 01:11:54,612
It's so cool! You all, you all get your own Thorn!

1349
01:11:55,112 --> 01:11:57,612
No, baby Thorn! So cute!

1350
01:11:58,112 --> 01:12:01,112
Oh gosh, I can't, I can't!

1351
01:12:01,212 --> 01:12:07,612
Oh, it's so cool! Gigi, you go, you go, you go!

1352
01:12:08,612 --> 01:12:13,112
And now, a hand-in cushion for Graham!

1353
01:12:14,112 --> 01:12:16,612
Do you remember seeing it? Sadly, there is no ojisan...

1354
01:12:16,712 --> 01:12:19,612
...to show you how soft and fluffy it is, but it is very fluffy...

1355
01:12:20,112 --> 01:12:23,112
...and it's made from a very squishy material...

1356
01:12:23,212 --> 01:12:25,612
...and you'll never want to stop squeezing it!

1357
01:12:26,112 --> 01:12:29,112
You'll never want to stop squeezing it! I'm gonna squeeze it!

1358
01:12:29,212 --> 01:12:32,112
It's so cute! And it's Graham!

1359
01:12:34,112 --> 01:12:40,112
Cece!

1360
01:12:40,212 --> 01:12:42,612
Check this out! It's Otomo pouch and socks set!

1361
01:12:43,112 --> 01:12:47,112
And do you want the socks? Monday, Tuesday, every day of the week,

1362
01:12:47,212 --> 01:12:52,112
seven pairs of socks! And then you have your little pouch,

1363
01:12:53,112 --> 01:12:55,612
the little Otomo pouch to put in your stuff. Yeah,

1364
01:12:55,712 --> 01:13:00,612
oh it's really cute, you can put anything in it of course, not only socks,

1365
01:13:01,112 --> 01:13:05,112
but yeah, I really like it. It's little Otomo

1366
01:13:05,212 --> 01:13:09,112
and it reminds me of the Otomo pouch I made once. I like it a lot! Yay!

1367
01:13:05,612 --> 01:13:08,612
You could put your toes in the Otomo socks!

1368
01:13:10,112 --> 01:13:13,612
It's my turn! Ah, and this is Raora's pencil case and keychain set!

1369
01:13:14,112 --> 01:13:17,112
It's me wearing a Chattino costume! And I'll be so happy if you fill it...

1370
01:13:17,212 --> 01:13:22,112
...so cute! You like it? Yay!

1371
01:13:23,112 --> 01:13:27,612
I'll be so happy if you fill it with lots of stationery and use it at school

1372
01:13:27,712 --> 01:13:34,112
or in the office or really anywhere you want! And the keychain can be attached

1373
01:13:34,212 --> 01:13:41,112
to the pencil case, so you clip it to your bag or anything you like!

1374
01:13:41,612 --> 01:13:44,612
Super cute! Yay!

1375
01:13:45,112 --> 01:13:47,612
Raora Chattino!

1376
01:13:48,112 --> 01:13:52,112
Everything is really cute. I'm super excited to see you guys with it.

1377
01:13:52,212 --> 01:13:56,612
I'm very excited to see all of Justice's merch! And if you want to know,

1378
01:13:56,712 --> 01:14:00,612
when can we purchase them? Well, they will all be available to purchase

1379
01:14:00,712 --> 01:14:04,112
right after this stream! So make sure to get them ASAP! ASAP!

1380
01:14:04,212 --> 01:14:07,612
And that's our merch announcement. Yeah!

1381
01:14:08,212 --> 01:14:10,112
That was the first one, and...

1382
01:14:11,112 --> 01:14:16,612
And as Cece just mentioned, there is one more announcement.

1383
01:14:16,712 --> 01:14:23,612
And you all know Justice will be performing live for the very first time at hololive English 3rd Concert!

1384
01:14:24,112 --> 01:14:27,612
Whoo!

1385
01:14:28,112 --> 01:14:30,612
It'll be taking place at the Radio City Music Hall in New York

1386
01:14:30,712 --> 01:14:34,612
on August 23rd and 24th PDT.

1387
01:14:35,112 --> 01:14:41,612
And right after this stream, we'll be redirecting you into the music video for All For One!

1388
01:14:41,712 --> 01:14:42,612
What? Music video!

1389
01:14:42,712 --> 01:14:46,612
Justice also is in there, and of course, and maybe,

1390
01:14:46,712 --> 01:14:52,112
maybe you'll see us doing some stuff. Who knows, you'll have to wait!

1391
01:14:53,112 --> 01:14:56,612
We'll be moving and grooving, maybe!

1392
01:14:56,712 --> 01:15:00,112
So make sure to stay tuned, it's gonna be very, very soon!

1393
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:02,220
It's getting a little sad...

1394
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,220
...but it's almost time to say goodbye.

1395
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:08,620
But before we go, let's each share our thoughts

1396
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,120
and thank all our fans for their support.

1397
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:11,520
Gigi, you go first.

1398
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:13,320
Me? Me? Okay!

1399
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:17,920
Grems, thank you so much for supporting us all this time!

1400
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:20,920
And can you believe it's been a little over a year now?

I can't... I can't believe it. Oh my gosh, we're 3D now!
