Welcome to Breaking Dimensions Day 1!

261
01:32:12,151 --> 01:32:13,851
First off, isn't it...

262
01:32:17,151 --> 01:32:18,851
Showtime baby, I would say

263
01:32:18,851 --> 01:32:20,351
Today's broadcast holds no delay

264
01:32:20,351 --> 01:32:21,551
Pulling out the stops isn't really enough

265
01:32:21,551 --> 01:32:22,851
So we're buffering endlessly... why?!

266
01:32:22,851 --> 01:32:24,351
Take it easy! What have we learned?

267
01:32:24,351 --> 01:32:25,551
Start a fire in their hearts when the PC burns up

268
01:32:25,551 --> 01:32:26,851
Optimistic, focus on the quick fit

269
01:32:26,851 --> 01:32:27,851
Teach new dogs all of our old tricks

270
01:32:27,851 --> 01:32:30,851
Still going stronger than ever, never saying die

271
01:32:30,851 --> 01:32:33,351
And I'm aware it's ironic but where's the freaking lie?

272
01:32:33,351 --> 01:32:34,351
Dreamers to dreamers

273
01:32:34,351 --> 01:32:35,351
Together we survive

274
01:32:35,351 --> 01:32:36,851
Must seem to you people

275
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:38,351
Like a mid-day crisis

276
01:32:39,551 --> 01:32:41,851
Searching new dimensions

277
01:32:41,851 --> 01:32:44,351
We can bring another mystery to light

278
01:32:44,551 --> 01:32:46,851
Planning our ascension

279
01:32:46,851 --> 01:32:48,351

280
01:32:48,351 --> 01:32:50,651

Join us while we're celebrating

282
01:32:53,351 --> 01:32:55,351
In the myth that we're creating

283
01:32:55,351 --> 01:32:57,851
There's another story waiting

284
01:32:57,851 --> 01:32:59,351
Through this world and beyond

285
01:32:59,351 --> 01:33:01,851
A distant dreams of prophecy

286
01:33:01,851 --> 01:33:03,851
Our strong and moving bond

287
01:33:03,851 --> 01:33:05,851
Guiding us endlessly

288
01:33:05,851 --> 01:33:07,351
Will bring us moments that we hold dear

289
01:33:07,351 --> 01:33:08,851
Time rushes on

290
01:33:08,851 --> 01:33:11,851
And though these winds may scatter us

291
01:33:11,851 --> 01:33:13,851
We'll keep this promise

292
01:33:13,851 --> 01:33:16,351
When the moment's finally right

293
01:33:16,351 --> 01:33:21,351
We'll always find a way to reunite!

294
01:33:21,851 --> 01:33:23,851
Hello, New York!

295
01:33:27,851 --> 01:33:32,851
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

296
01:33:32,851 --> 01:33:34,651
I'm diving in again now

297
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:35,851
It's time to sink or swim

298
01:33:35,851 --> 01:33:37,351
I'll pledge to try the deeper end

299
01:33:37,351 --> 01:33:38,551
But could you hold my fin?

300
01:33:38,551 --> 01:33:40,151
Vibing with every end

301
01:33:40,151 --> 01:33:41,351
Let's kick back and ponder, ponder

302
01:33:41,351 --> 01:33:42,551
Tacos primarily

303
01:33:42,551 --> 01:33:43,851
Then let's get cozy and have fun

304
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:45,351
Nobody escapes death

305
01:33:45,351 --> 01:33:46,551
And I know that it's morbid

306
01:33:46,551 --> 01:33:47,851
Years come and go, I still pretend

307
01:33:47,851 --> 01:33:49,151
That God is killing things sorted

308
01:33:49,151 --> 01:33:50,551
Listen I wanna look cool

309
01:33:50,551 --> 01:33:52,151
But I keep on tripping and falling

310
01:33:52,151 --> 01:33:53,351
Guess I'll stay playing the fool

311
01:33:53,351 --> 01:33:55,351
To hold up the combat calling you back

312
01:33:55,351 --> 01:33:57,851
Countless moments

313
01:33:57,851 --> 01:34:00,851
Led us to this day

314
01:34:00,851 --> 01:34:03,351
Triumph and sorrow, hope for tomorrow

315
01:34:03,351 --> 01:34:05,351
We'll always find our way

316
01:34:05,351 --> 01:34:08,851
Come what may

317
01:34:09,851 --> 01:34:12,851
New York! Make some noise!

318
01:34:30,851 --> 01:34:33,351
In every universe

319
01:34:33,351 --> 01:34:36,351
We were always meant to meet

320
01:34:36,551 --> 01:34:39,351
Our little boundless search

321
01:34:39,351 --> 01:34:41,851
We will never know defeat

322
01:34:41,851 --> 01:34:44,351
My wings will guide your hands

323
01:34:44,351 --> 01:34:46,851
As the fateful days go by

324
01:34:46,851 --> 01:34:50,151
We will catch the path

325
01:34:50,151 --> 01:34:53,351
Through a never ending sky

326
01:34:53,551 --> 01:34:55,351
Drawing us together

327
01:34:55,351 --> 01:34:57,851
I can sense another wish is coming true

328
01:34:57,851 --> 01:34:59,351
Each typhoon we'll...

329
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:03,899
Where strengths are true, me and you.

330
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:10,899
Sing out again, the cloudless skies give way to clear.

331
01:35:12,199 --> 01:35:15,899
We'll start this new refrain, brimming with memories.

332
01:35:16,599 --> 01:35:18,799
Another story starting right here.

333
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:21,199
We'll keep forging ahead

334
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:23,399
to make a saga all our own.

335
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:27,799
Whichever paths we tread, steadily journeying,

336
01:35:28,399 --> 01:35:31,199
We know we're never really alone.

337
01:35:31,699 --> 01:35:35,199
If we believe, wherever fate may find us,

338
01:35:35,799 --> 01:35:37,399
Our love will find us,

339
01:35:37,399 --> 01:35:39,199
every after-chapter we write

340
01:35:39,899 --> 01:35:43,999
Will set us on the path to reunite.

341
01:36:31,399 --> 01:36:32,799
Are you ready?!

342
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:48,199
A certain love I thought I'd never understand,

343
01:36:48,199 --> 01:36:51,199
couldn't help it when you took my hand.

344
01:36:51,599 --> 01:36:54,399
Bright side never before, you left me wanting more,

345
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:57,199
destroyed everything just to get a bit ahead.

346
01:36:57,599 --> 01:37:00,999
Life flies by in zip-code reality,

347
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:03,599
Not sure of much but I know I'm ready,

348
01:37:03,599 --> 01:37:05,799
soaring these streets make me complete,

349
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:09,899
Full throttle, come give me your all.

350
01:37:11,399 --> 01:37:14,399
Engines on, keeping up with the beat of my heart,

351
01:37:14,399 --> 01:37:16,799
just can't get enough.

352
01:37:17,399 --> 01:37:20,399
Revving up make it fast, only us make it last

353
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:22,899
'til the sun's up.

354
01:37:23,599 --> 01:37:26,899
A shot in the dark, take me away,

355
01:37:27,399 --> 01:37:30,399
Fizzing up in my heart, it's okay.

356
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:33,399
Accelerate me until I'm there,

357
01:37:33,399 --> 01:37:35,399
you and I reach the line, marking a view.

358
01:37:36,199 --> 01:37:39,399
Keep it going until the bubbles fade,

359
01:37:39,799 --> 01:37:42,899
I don't care if I don't see another day.

360
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:45,899
Shocking in my heart, give me all that you got,

361
01:37:45,899 --> 01:37:47,799
wheeling down, don't hesitate a minute more.

362
01:37:48,399 --> 01:37:51,899
Time is not enough, fill it up, and don't look back again.

363
01:37:52,599 --> 01:37:54,999
Carbonated love.

364
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:10,799
A settled love is better than I could have dreamed,

365
01:38:10,799 --> 01:38:12,999
look at what we've done, we're too extreme.

366
01:38:13,799 --> 01:38:16,799
Pour me your favorite drink, so much until we sink,

367
01:38:16,799 --> 01:38:18,999
down to the bottom, don't want to miss a thing.

368
01:38:19,799 --> 01:38:22,899
The track we're on might crash, oh what am I to do?

369
01:38:22,899 --> 01:38:25,599
Rushing in, ignoring all avenues.

370
01:38:26,399 --> 01:38:31,899
Race to the night, my guiding light, sparkling I'm right here with you.

371
01:38:32,799 --> 01:38:35,899
Engines on, keeping up with the beat of my heart,

372
01:38:35,899 --> 01:38:37,999
just can't get enough.

373
01:38:38,799 --> 01:38:41,899
Revving up make it fast, only us make it last

374
01:38:41,899 --> 01:38:44,599
'til the sun's up.

375
01:38:45,399 --> 01:38:48,799
A shot in the dark, take me away,

376
01:38:49,399 --> 01:38:52,599
Fizzing up in my heart, it's okay.

377
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:55,599
Accelerate me until I'm there,

378
01:38:55,599 --> 01:38:57,599
you and I reach the line, marking a view.

379
01:38:58,199 --> 01:39:01,799
Keep it going until the bubbles fade,

380
01:39:02,199 --> 01:39:05,199
I don't care if I don't see another day.

381
01:39:05,799 --> 01:39:08,399
Shocking in my heart, give me all that you got,

382
01:39:08,399 --> 01:39:10,399
wheeling down, don't hesitate a minute more.

383
01:39:10,799 --> 01:39:14,399
Time is not enough, fill it up, and don't look back again.

384
01:39:14,899 --> 01:39:17,399
Carbonated love.

385
01:39:30,399 --> 01:39:32,799
A glass of empty company without you,

386
01:39:32,799 --> 01:39:34,899
make such a mess of me, don't care if I'm a fool.

387
01:39:35,599 --> 01:39:39,399
Another night let's speed up, let's make it new,

388
01:39:39,399 --> 01:39:42,899
love me despite the way I'm crazy just for you.

389
01:39:55,399 --> 01:39:58,599
A shot in the dark, take me away,

390
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:02,399
Fizzing up in my heart, it's okay.

391
01:40:02,999 --> 01:40:05,599
Accelerate me until I'm there,

392
01:40:05,599 --> 01:40:07,799
you and I reach the line, marking a view.

393
01:40:05,479 --> 01:40:06,679
...feel alive and be what we will

394
01:40:06,679 --> 01:40:09,279
Keep on going until the bubbles fade

395
01:40:09,479 --> 01:40:13,879
I don't care if I don't see another day

396
01:40:13,979 --> 01:40:16,779
Shocking in my heart, give me all that you got

397
01:40:16,879 --> 01:40:19,679
Bring us down, don't hesitate a minute more

398
01:40:19,779 --> 01:40:23,779
Love the rush we shouldn't, don't give up and never again

399
01:40:23,879 --> 01:40:27,179
Our time is up, not enough, fill it up then begin

400
01:40:27,179 --> 01:40:30,379

BAU BAU! Thank you!

510
01:45:42,928 --> 01:45:45,728
But just in case, Mococo-chan, let's introduce ourselves.

511
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:48,228
Okay! Hmm...

512
01:45:49,428 --> 01:45:51,428
I'm not a chihuahua...

513
01:45:51,428 --> 01:45:52,928
...I'm Fuwawa!

514
01:45:52,928 --> 01:45:55,628
BAU BAU! Thank you!

515
01:45:56,228 --> 01:45:57,628
And me now! Oh, oh!

516
01:45:58,428 --> 01:46:00,228
I'm not Fuwawa...

517
01:46:00,228 --> 01:46:01,728
...I'm Mococo!

518
01:46:02,228 --> 01:46:04,628
BAU BAU!

519
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:07,828
Together we're hololive English -Advent-'s twin demon guard dogs...

520
01:46:07,828 --> 01:46:11,828
...we are FUWAMOCO! BAU BAU!

521
01:46:11,828 --> 01:46:16,428

Thank you for all your BAU BAUs!

523
01:46:19,828 --> 01:46:22,928
BAU BAU! BAU BAU!

524
01:46:24,228 --> 01:46:26,728
Wow! That song that was just performed...

525
01:46:26,728 --> 01:46:28,728
...is our original song...

526
01:46:28,728 --> 01:46:31,428
..."Born to Be"!

527
01:46:31,428 --> 01:46:34,728
BAU BAU! Thank you so much! Did you have fun?

528
01:46:34,728 --> 01:46:36,828

529
01:46:36,828 --> 01:46:38,628
Mococo-chan, did you hear that?

01:46:38,628 --> 01:46:40,628
Right, I know! BAU BAU!

531
01:46:40,628 --> 01:46:43,728
Thank you! Thank you!

532
01:46:44,628 --> 01:46:47,628
Well, today a big dream of ours came true.

533
01:46:47,628 --> 01:46:50,828
Yeah! And that was being here together with you...

534
01:46:50,828 --> 01:46:53,828
...at our first-ever 3D concert!

535
01:46:53,828 --> 01:46:56,828
BAU BAU! You know, I...

536
01:46:56,828 --> 01:46:59,228
...if it's okay...

537
01:46:59,228 --> 01:47:01,628
...I'd like to be a bit selfish.

538
01:47:01,628 --> 01:47:02,828
Selfish?

539
01:47:02,828 --> 01:47:04,828
Yeah, is that okay? I have another dream.

540
01:47:05,828 --> 01:47:08,828
Can we grant it all together?

541
01:47:08,828 --> 01:47:11,828
Hmm? Mococo-chan, what kind of dream?

542
01:47:11,828 --> 01:47:14,228
Well, I would like to hear you BAU BAU...
