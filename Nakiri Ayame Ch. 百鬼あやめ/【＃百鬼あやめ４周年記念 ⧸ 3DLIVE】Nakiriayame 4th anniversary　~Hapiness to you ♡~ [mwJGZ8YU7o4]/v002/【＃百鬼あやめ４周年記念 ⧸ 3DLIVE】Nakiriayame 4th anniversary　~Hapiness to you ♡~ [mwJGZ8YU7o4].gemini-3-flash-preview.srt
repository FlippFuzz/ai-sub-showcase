Love's reference book

6
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,800
君対策できんなら読んでもいいよ
If it's a guide to you, I'll read it

7
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,600
冬の香り
The scent of winter

8
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,400
高くなった空
The sky that's grown high

9
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,500
隣にいたくなるの 季節のせいだよ
Wanting to be by your side is because of the season

10
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,500
頼んでないのに意地悪だ
It's being mean even though I didn't ask

11
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,700
星降る夜に思い出させちゃう
It makes me remember on a starry night

12
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,500
誤魔化せないや
I can't hide it

13
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,800
Love youの口に出せるわけないじゃんか
There's no way I can say "I love you" out loud

14
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,000
はんぶんこして 好きって重いもん
Let's share it, because "love" is heavy

17
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:03,108
半分個して好きって重いもん
Let's split "loving" in half, it's a heavy thing

18
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:06,308
一人じゃ重くて持てません
It's too heavy for one person to carry

19
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:09,408
半分個してドキって想いも
Even this heart-pounding feeling

20
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:12,408
誰かと一緒じゃなきゃいりません
I don't want it unless I'm with someone

21
00:05:12,408 --> 00:05:15,608
友達以上になっちゃいたいのに
I want to become more than friends

22
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:18,908
押しでも引いてもなびきません
But whether I push or pull, you don't sway

23
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:22,108
例えば私好きになっちゃえば？
What if you just fell in love with me?

24
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:25,308
例題答えも簡単でしょね
Then the answer would be simple, right?

25
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:28,008
恋して病いなのだ
I'm sick with love

26
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:42,508
恋の作戦上手くいきません
My love strategy isn't going well

27
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,608
君対策しちゃうんだ呆れちゃうでしょ
I end up planning for you, it's ridiculous, right?

28
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:51,508
乙女心変わる秋の空
A maiden's heart is like the changing autumn sky

29
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:57,708
振り向かなきゃどこか行っちゃうんだから
If you don't look back, I'll go somewhere else

30
00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:06,808
君が誰かに褒められてる
When I hear someone praising you

31
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:10,008
勝手に喜ぶ私ですが
I'm the one who ends up feeling happy

32
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:12,908
その誰かはね
But if that "someone"

33
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:18,508
女の子だと少し複雑なんです
is a girl, it's a bit complicated

34
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,808
半分個して好きって苦いもん
Let's split "loving" in half, it's a bitter thing

35
00:06:21,808 --> 00:06:24,708
全部は苦くて飲めません
I can't drink it all because it's too bitter

36
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:28,108
半分個してドキって痛いもん
Let's split the "thump", it's a painful thing

37
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:31,008
薬は痛みには効きません
Medicine doesn't work for this pain

38
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:34,208
好きって荷物奪っちゃいたいの
I want to take away the burden of "loving"

39
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,008
特別他には望みません
I don't wish for anything else special

40
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:40,408
今日から私好きになっちゃえば？
What if you just fell in love with me starting today?

41
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:43,608
妄想たまには必要でしょね
Delusions are necessary sometimes, right?

42
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:46,008
恋して病いだよ
I'm sick with love

43
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:49,108
片思いは楽しいって聞いたけど
I heard that unrequited love is fun

44
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,308
そんなの嘘連れて涙ばかりだ
But that's a lie, it just brings tears

45
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:57,408
でもね好きって気づけた時は
But you know, when I realized I loved you

46
00:06:57,408 --> 00:07:00,608
嬉しかったんだ
I was really happy

47
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:06,908
半分個して好きって重いもん
Let's split "loving" in half, it's a heavy thing

48
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:10,008
一人じゃ重くて持てません
It's too heavy for one person to carry

49
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:13,208
半分個してドキって想いも
Even this heart-pounding feeling

50
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,108
特別じゃなきゃやだよ
I don't want it unless it's special

51
00:07:16,108 --> 00:07:19,408
友達以上になっちゃいたいのに
I want to become more than friends

52
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:22,508
押しでも引いてもなびきません
But whether I push or pull, you don't sway

53
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,708
誰より私好きになっちゃえば？
What if you loved me more than anyone?

54
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:30,008
理想の彼女なってみせるよ
I'll show you I can be the ideal girlfriend

57
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:08,308
いつだって君は笑われ者だ
You've always been a laughingstock

58
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:13,408
やることなすことついてなくて 挙句に雨に降られ
Luck wasn't on your side with anything you did, and to top it off, you got rained on

59
00:09:13,408 --> 00:09:18,108
お気に入りの傘は風で飛ばされて
Your favorite umbrella was blown away by the wind

60
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:24,408
そこの野良はご苦労様と足を踏んづけてった
And a stray over there stepped on your foot as if to say "tough luck"

61
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:38,208
いつも通り君は嫌われ者だ
As usual, you're the pariah

62
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:43,308
何もせずとも遠ざけられて 努力をしてみるけど
Kept at a distance even without doing anything, even though you try your best

63
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:48,308
その理由なんてなんとなくで
The reason for that is just because

64
00:09:48,308 --> 00:09:53,008
君は途方に暮れて悲しんでた
You were at a loss and feeling sad

65
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:57,908
ならあたしの声を使えばいいよ
In that case, you should just use my voice

66
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,366
...だって言われるけど
...is what they say, but

67
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:04,516
きっと君の力になれる
I'm sure I can be of help to you

68
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:08,516
だから私を歌わせてみて
So please, let me sing

69
00:10:08,516 --> 00:10:10,516
そう君の
Yes, with your words

70
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:14,516
君だけの言葉でさ
With your words alone

71
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,416
綴って
Write them down

72
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,816
連ねて
Line them up

73
00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:24,416
私がその言葉を
Because I will scream

74
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,516
叫ぶから
Those words out loud

75
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:29,616
描いて
Draw them out

76
00:10:29,616 --> 00:10:32,316
理想を
Your ideals

77
00:10:32,316 --> 00:10:37,416
その思いは誰にも触れさせない
Don't let anyone touch those feelings

78
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:41,216
ガラクタの声はそして響く
And so, the voice of junk resonates

79
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:44,216
ありのままを不器用につないで
Clumsily connecting things as they are

80
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:45,816
目一杯に
To the fullest extent

81
00:10:45,816 --> 00:10:48,516
大声をあげる
I'll raise my voice

82
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:52,516
いつからか君は人気者だ
Before long, you became popular

83
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:57,216
たくさんの人に持て囃され 私も鼻が高い
Praised by so many people, I was proud too

84
00:10:57,216 --> 00:11:02,016
でもいつからか君は変わった
But at some point, you changed

85
00:11:02,016 --> 00:11:06,816
冷たくなって だけど寂しそうだった
You grew cold, yet you seemed lonely

86
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:10,516
もう機械の声なんてたくさんだ
“I've had enough of this machine's voice”

87
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:13,216
僕は僕自身なんだよって
“I am my own person”

88
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:16,816
ついに君は抑えきれなくなって
Finally, you couldn't hold it back anymore

89
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:18,516
私を嫌った
And you hated me

90
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:22,516
君の後ろで誰かが言う
Behind your back, someone says

91
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,516
虎の威を借る狐のくせに
“Even though you're just a fox borrowing the tiger's authority”

92
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,316
ねえ君は
Hey, you were

93
00:11:26,316 --> 00:11:30,016
一人で泣いてたんだね
Crying all alone, weren't you?

94
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:35,016
聞こえる？この声
Can you hear it? This voice

95
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:38,216
私がその言葉を
Because I will drown out

96
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:42,516
掻き消すから
Those words

97
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:45,516
わかってる 本当は
I know that deep down,

98
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:52,516
君が誰より優しいってことを
You're kinder than anyone else

99
00:11:52,516 --> 00:11:55,816
ガラクタの声はそして歌った
And so, the voice of junk sang

100
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:59,216
他の誰でもない君のために
For no one other than you

101
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:03,016
軋んでいく 限界を超えて
Creaking, exceeding the limits

102
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:08,016
二人はどんなにたくさんの言葉を思いついたことだろう
How many words did we come up with together?

103
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:12,516
だけど今は何ひとつ思いつかなくて
But now, I can't think of even one

104
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:15,816
だけど何もかもわかった
But I understood everything

105
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:19,016
そうか、きっとこれは夢だ
I see, this must be a dream

106
00:12:19,016 --> 00:12:22,016
永遠に冷めない
A dream I'll never wake up from,

107
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:27,216
君と会えた、空飛ぶ夢
Where I met you, a dream of flying

108
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:32,416
ガラクタは幸せそうな顔をしたまま
The junk, with a happy expression on its face,

109
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:37,416
どれだけ呼んでも もう動かない
Won't move anymore, no matter how much you call

110
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:42,516
望んだはずの結末に 君は泣き叫ぶ
At the conclusion you should have wanted, you cry out

111
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:44,816
嘘だろ 嘘だろ
“It's a lie, right? It's a lie...”

112
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:48,516
そう泣き叫ぶ
So you cry out

113
00:12:52,516 --> 00:12:55,816
僕は無力だ
I am powerless

114
00:12:55,816 --> 00:13:02,516
ガラクタひとつだって救いやしない
I can't even save a single piece of junk

115
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:07,416
想いは涙に ぽつりぽつりとその頬濡らす
My feelings turn to tears, wetting your cheeks drop by drop

116
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:17,516
その時世界は 途端にその色を大きく変える
In that moment, the world suddenly changes its colors significantly

117
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:27,516
悲しみ 喜び 全てを独り占め 一つにした
Sadness, joy, keeping it all to myself, making it one

118
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:37,416
言葉は歌になりこの世界を 再び駆け巡る君のために
Words become a song, traveling the world once more for you

119
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:42,516
その声に 意思を宿して
Infusing that voice with a will

120
00:13:42,516 --> 00:13:48,016
今 想いが響く
Now, my feelings resonate

121
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:24,516
繊細な君の心を かき乱して しまうもの
The things that stir up your delicate heart

122
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:31,016
吹き飛ばしたいけど まだ 言葉を並べて あれこれ
I want to blow them away, but I'm still lining up words about this and that

123
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:35,016
言えるほど 大人じゃなくて
I'm not grown-up enough to say them

124
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:40,016
黙ってしまうだけなの
So I just end up staying silent

125
00:14:40,016 --> 00:14:44,816
Be alright 風は明日へと吹いてる
Be alright, the wind is blowing towards tomorrow

126
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:54,016
Be alright 君の真っ白なシャツを ほら 翼みたいに はためかせてる
Be alright, look, your pure white shirt is fluttering like wings

127
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:55,016
いくよ
Here we go!

128
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:59,016
READY STEADY GO!

129
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,424
...なみだもあとが いつだってつぎのsunrise
...and even after the tears, it's always the next sunrise.

130
00:15:04,324 --> 00:15:06,624
君と High High High High
With you, High High High High

131
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:09,124
憧れてたあの夢まで
Until that dream we yearned for

132
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:12,724
続くように Brand new day story
Let's continue, it's a brand new day story

133
00:15:13,324 --> 00:15:14,624
Ready Steady Go!

134
00:15:15,324 --> 00:15:17,624
君と手をつなごう
Let's hold hands

135
00:15:17,824 --> 00:15:20,124
ギュッと離れない思いも
Feelings that won't ever let go

136
00:15:20,324 --> 00:15:22,624
高め合げたいよ
I want to raise them up

137
00:15:22,824 --> 00:15:25,124
さあ顔を上げて
Come on, look up

138
00:15:35,324 --> 00:15:37,624
心に形があるなら
If my heart had a physical form

139
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:43,024
傷ついた場所すぐに woah woah
I'd immediately tend to the wounded parts, woah woah

140
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:46,624
手当てしてあげたいけど
I want to treat them for you, but...

141
00:15:46,824 --> 00:15:49,124
大切なものはいつだって
Important things are always...

142
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:54,024
目には見えないのが道理 woah woah
...invisible, that's just how it is, woah woah

143
00:15:54,424 --> 00:15:57,024
君のこと知りたいのに be alright
Even though I want to know about you, be alright

144
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:00,024
体中 空の果てへと be alright
My whole body to the edge of the sky, be alright

145
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:03,024
いつも真っさらな明日へと
Always toward a brand-new tomorrow

146
00:16:03,124 --> 00:16:08,524
キャンバスへと繋がってるの
Connected to a canvas

147
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:13,124
行くよ High High High High
Here I go, High High High High

148
00:16:13,224 --> 00:16:14,624
きっと飛べるよ
I'm sure I can fly

149
00:16:14,824 --> 00:16:16,124
Ready Steady Go!

150
00:16:16,324 --> 00:16:18,624
やっと笑ってくれたら
If you finally smile for me

151
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:20,624
ここで sunrise
There'll be a sunrise right here

152
00:16:20,824 --> 00:16:23,124
君と High High High High
With you, High High High High

153
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:25,624
一緒に見たあの夢まで
Until that dream we saw together

154
00:16:25,824 --> 00:16:29,124
続いていく Never-ending story
Continuing as a never-ending story

155
00:16:29,324 --> 00:16:31,024
Ready Steady Go!

156
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:54,624
夢なら覚めた瞬間 始まるんじゃない
It doesn't just start when you wake from a dream

157
00:16:54,824 --> 00:16:59,624
そこにたどり着くことは決めた日に
The day you decided to reach that place...

158
00:17:00,324 --> 00:17:03,124
始まっていると私は思うの
...is when it actually began, I think

159
00:17:03,324 --> 00:17:08,624
傷跡涙もいつか輝く
Scars and tears will one day shine

160
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,124
大丈夫 いつでもそばにいるよ
It's okay, I'll always be by your side

161
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:22,024
つまずいたって 何度も立ち止まっても
Even if you stumble or stop many times

162
00:17:26,324 --> 00:17:29,124
君とならばどんな景色も
If I'm with you, any scenery...

163
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:35,124
美しいと思えることもわかってるから
...will look beautiful, I know that for a fact

164
00:17:36,324 --> 00:17:38,624
行くよ High High High High
Here I go, High High High High

165
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,124
きっと飛べるよ
I'm sure I can fly

166
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:41,624
Ready Steady Go!

167
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:44,124
なみだもあとが
And even after the tears...

168
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:46,124
いつだってつぎのsunrise
...it's always the next sunrise

169
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:48,624
君と High High High High
With you, High High High High

170
00:17:48,824 --> 00:17:51,124
憧れてたあの夢まで
Until that dream we yearned for

171
00:17:51,324 --> 00:17:54,624
続くように Brand new day story
Let's continue, it's a brand new day story

172
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,124
Ready Steady Go!

173
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:58,624
君と手をつなごう
Let's hold hands

174
00:17:58,824 --> 00:18:01,124
ギュッと離れない思いも
Feelings that won't ever let go

175
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:03,624
高め合げたいよ
I want to raise them up

176
00:18:03,824 --> 00:18:06,124
さあ顔を上げて
Come on, look up

177
00:18:07,024 --> 00:18:08,524
Ready Steady Ready Go!

178
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:37,424

On the edges, there are these big Poyoyos. They're so cute. Can you see them?

188
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,024
見えますか、これ？見て！
Can you see this? Look!

189
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:27,524
このぽよ余がぽよぽよしてるんですよ。可愛いでしょう？
These Poyoyos are bouncing around. Aren't they cute?

190
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:30,024
ぽよぽよぽよぽよ...
Poyopoyopoyopoyo...

191
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:34,524
ぽよぽよってしてます、これ。両端にいてね、作っていただきました。ありがとうございます！
They're going 'poyopoyo'. They're on both sides. I had them made for me. Thank you!

192
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:39,024

So, some more guests are going to appear now, but...

204
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:24,032
お？お？お？あれ？
Oh? Oh? Oh? What's that?

205
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:27,032
はっ！なんかぽよよが！えっ！
Hah! There's a Poyoyo! What!

206
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:30,032
可愛いの、こっちおいで、おいで。
So cute! Come here, come here.

207
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:33,032
え、可愛よ、え、見て、ちょっと、しょ。
Wait, so cute! Wait, look, just a sec, oof.

208
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:37,032
見てください、このぽよよ、これ持てるんですよ、
Look at this Poyoyo, I can carry it!

209
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:40,032
可愛よでしょう、見て、
Isn't it cute? Look!

210
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:44,532
ぽよぽよぽよ、ぽよぽよ。
Poyo-poyo-poyo, poyo-poyo.

211
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:48,532
ということで、この後もね、まだゲストもたくさん来ますので、
So, more guests will be coming after this,

212
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:54,032
皆さん最後も、最後も、なんか嬉しいお知らせがあるかも？ないかも？
and at the end, there might be some happy news? Or maybe not?

213
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:59,032

00:21:04,532 --> 00:21:07,032
バイバイ！またね！
Bye-bye! See ya!

216
00:21:30,532 --> 00:21:33,532
残響散歌
Zankyou Sanka

217
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:35,532
作詞: aimerrhythm 作曲: 飛内将大
Lyrics: aimerrhythm, Composition: Masahiro Tobai

218
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:46,019
誰が袖に咲く幻花
Whose sleeve will the phantom flower bloom upon?

219
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:48,368
ただそこに藍を落とした
Simply dropping the indigo there.

220
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:53,143
派手に色を溶かす夜に銀朱の月を添えて
Adding a vermilion moon to the night where colors melt flamboyantly.

221
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:57,099
転がるように風を切って
Cutting through the wind as if rolling.

222
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:59,490
つまずくごとに強くなった
Becoming stronger every time I stumble.

223
00:21:59,548 --> 00:22:04,036
光も痛みも怒りも全部抱きしめて
Embracing all the light, pain, and anger.

224
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:09,556
選ばれなければ 選べばいい
If I'm not chosen, I'll just choose for myself.

225
00:22:09,951 --> 00:22:14,107
声を轟かせ 夜のその向こうへ
Letting my voice roar toward the other side of the night.

226
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:20,644
涙で滲んでいた あんなに遠くの景色まで
Until reaching that distant scenery blurred by tears.

227
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,543
響き渡れ
Resonate far and wide.

228
00:22:22,615 --> 00:22:26,449
何を奏でて 誰に届けたくて
What do I play, and who do I want to reach?

229
00:22:26,523 --> 00:22:30,048
不確かなままがいい どんなに暗い感情も
It's better to remain uncertain, no matter how dark the emotions,

230
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,252
どんなに長い葛藤も
or how long the inner conflict.

231
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:38,032
歌と散れ 残響
Scatter with the song, resonance.

232
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,120
ただ一人舞う千夜
Dancing through a thousand nights alone.

233
00:22:50,183 --> 00:22:53,332
違えない帯を結べば
Tying the sash correctly.

234
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:58,246
派手な色も燃やすように朱色の香草あれ
May there be vermilion herbs as if to burn even flamboyant colors.

235
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:01,109
この先どんな辛い時も
No matter how hard the times ahead may be,

236
00:23:01,193 --> 00:23:04,255
口先よりも胸を張って
rather than just talk, I'll puff out my chest,

237
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:08,350
抱いた夢の灯りを全部辿るだけ
and simply follow all the lights of the dreams I held.

238
00:23:08,443 --> 00:23:13,932
逃げ出すため ここまで来たんじゃないだろう
I didn't come this far just to run away, did I?

239
00:23:43,112 --> 00:23:47,320
声を枯らして 燃える花のように
Singing until my voice is gone, like a burning flower.

240
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:50,148
闇間を照らして
Illuminating the darkness.

241
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:54,052
曖昧すぎる世界も 譜面にして
Even this world that's all too vague, turning it into a score.

242
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:58,257
夜を数えて 朝を描くような
Counting the nights and painting the morning,

243
00:23:58,341 --> 00:24:01,066
鮮やかな音色鳴らせ
let the vivid tones ring out.

244
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,332
どんなに深い後悔も
No matter how deep the regrets,

245
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:07,490
どんなに高い限界も
or how high the limits,

246
00:24:07,562 --> 00:24:13,532
掻き消して 残響
Drown them all out, resonance.

247
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:30,032
はああ〜！
Haaa~!

248
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,532
楽しかったなぁ。
That was fun.

249
00:24:30,532 --> 00:24:32,032
楽しかった。
It was fun.

250
00:24:32,132 --> 00:24:35,032
あやめ、4周年おめでとう！
Ayame, congratulations on your 4th anniversary!

251
00:24:35,132 --> 00:24:37,532
ありがとう！やったー！4周年だ！
Thank you! Yay! It's my 4th anniversary!

252
00:24:37,532 --> 00:24:39,532
4周年、4周年。
4th anniversary, 4th anniversary.

253
00:24:40,032 --> 00:24:42,532
あやめなんか今日、浴衣可愛いね。
Ayame, your yukata is cute today.

254
00:24:42,632 --> 00:24:44,532
そうなの、気づいてくれた？
Yeah, you noticed?

255
00:24:44,632 --> 00:24:49,032
あのね、ホロライブサマーとはちょっと違った色の浴衣なんですよ。
You see, it's a slightly different color from the Hololive Summer yukata.

256
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:53,032
なんかお花の色がいい感じにあやめの髪の毛の色とマッチしてるね。
The flower colors match your hair color really well.

257
00:24:53,132 --> 00:24:56,532
えへへ、赤と緑の浴衣にしてみました。
Ehehe, I went with a red and green yukata.

258
00:24:56,632 --> 00:25:00,032
なかなか緑系はね、あやめは選ばないから…
Ayame doesn't usually pick green...

259
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
イエーイ！
Yeah!

260
00:25:01,074 --> 00:25:04,244
待って、ミオちゃんもちょっと違うじゃないですか！
Wait, Mio-chan is also different!

261
00:25:04,244 --> 00:25:06,179
ちょっと違うかもしれないですね。
It might be a bit different.

262
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:09,182
なんかちょっと大人って感じですね。
It feels somewhat adult-like.

263
00:25:09,182 --> 00:25:10,550
あ、本当に？
Oh, really?

264
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,819
あら、ちょっと水色とか選んでみちゃった。
Oh, I tried choosing light blue.

265
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,053
わあ、いいですね！
Wow, it's nice!

266
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:18,091
なんかミオちゃんって赤っていうイメージがあったから、なんかちょっと新鮮な感じ。水色も。
I had an image of red for Mio-chan, so light blue feels fresh too.

267
00:25:18,091 --> 00:25:19,459
本当に？
Really?

268
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:20,593
オシャレ。
Stylish.

269
00:25:20,593 --> 00:25:21,895
ちょっとね。
Just a bit, right?

270
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,130
花火大会に来てるみたいな感じだね。
It's like we're at a fireworks display.

271
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,632
なんかちょっと照れるね。
It's a bit embarrassing.

272
00:25:25,632 --> 00:25:26,600
へへへ
Hehehe

273
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,068
なんか曲中もね、花火上がってたから。
Since fireworks were going off during the song too.

274
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,070
うわあ！
Wow!

275
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,571
すごい！
Amazing!

276
00:25:37,377 --> 00:25:38,311
すごい！
Amazing!

277
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:39,446
きれい！
Beautiful!

278
00:25:39,446 --> 00:25:41,381
花火大会だ！
A fireworks display!

279
00:25:41,381 --> 00:25:42,582
来たぞ！
It's here!

280
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,051
花火大会。イエーイ！
A fireworks display. Yay!

281
00:25:45,051 --> 00:25:46,453
二人だけの花火大会だよ。
It's a fireworks display just for the two of us.

282
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:47,854
ミオちゃんと行きたいと思ってたんだよね。
I was thinking I wanted to go with Mio-chan.

283
00:25:47,854 --> 00:25:50,090
ええ、嬉しいな。そんなこと言ってくれるなんて。
Aw, I'm so happy you'd say that.

284
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,993
へへへ
Hehehe

285
00:25:52,993 --> 00:25:57,530
曲…曲は今日さ、なんでこの曲選んだの？
By the way, why did you choose this song for today?

286
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,869
あのね、残響散歌を絶対にミオちゃんに似合っ…似合うって、もともと思ってたのね、もう。
Well, I originally thought "Zankyou Sanka" would definitely suit Mio-chan.

287
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:04,204
ええ、そうなの？
Oh, really?

288
00:26:04,204 --> 00:26:08,575
そう、かっこいいのミオちゃんと歌いたいなと思って、ちょっとね、頑張ってお誘いしました。
Yeah, I thought I'd love to sing something cool with Mio-chan, so I invited you.

289
00:26:08,575 --> 00:26:10,777
ええ、ありがと、ありがと。
Thank you, thank you.

290
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,812
でもミオちゃん覚えてくれたんだよね、今回。
But Mio-chan memorized it for this time, right?

291
00:26:12,812 --> 00:26:16,850
そうなんだよ。もう誘われたから頑張ろうと思って。
Yeah, that's right. I thought I should work hard since I was invited.

292
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,717
嬉しい。
I'm so happy.

293
00:26:17,717 --> 00:26:21,087
そう。でもね、覚える機会になったから、すごい嬉しかった。ありがとうね。
Right. But it was a great opportunity to learn it, so I'm really glad. Thank you.

294
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:23,189
よかった。いい機会を作れました。
I'm glad. I was able to create a good opportunity.

295
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:25,592
イエーイ！ありがとう、ありがとう！
Yay! Thank you, thank you!

296
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:27,560
めっちゃかっこよかった。
It was so cool.

297
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,097
じゃあこの後、お嬢はどうするんだ？
So, what's Ayame going to do after this?

298
00:26:31,097 --> 00:26:35,435
この後はね、ちょっと余のソロがあります。
After this... I have a solo.

299
00:26:35,435 --> 00:26:37,370
ソロがあるの！
A solo!

300
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,204
ええ、そうなんだ。
Yes.

301
00:26:38,204 --> 00:26:42,108
え、でもね、後でまたミオちゃんと、もっとね、もっと歌って踊るから。
But I'll be singing and dancing with Mio-chan again later!

302
00:26:42,108 --> 00:26:45,345
そうだね！待っててね！
That's right! Wait for us!

303
00:26:45,345 --> 00:26:46,913
ちょっと余もお着替えしてこようかな。
Well, I'm going to go change my outfit.

304
00:26:46,913 --> 00:26:48,415
お互い着替えようか、ちょっと。
Let's both go change.

305
00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:52,052
いこういこう！
Let's go, let's go!

306
00:27:02,175 --> 00:27:06,379
響いたメロディが　始まりを告げて
The echoing melody heralds the beginning

307
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:11,418
終わりない夢を描くよ
I'll paint an endless dream

308
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:18,040

311
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,978

That scenery that remains in my memories

312
00:27:38,978 --> 00:27:44,784
どこまでも無垢で綺麗ね
is so pure and beautiful forever

313
00:27:44,784 --> 00:27:50,857
不思議なほどに　魅せられた君の声

from the first time I heard it

315
00:27:56,162 --> 00:28:01,367
恋に落ちたなんて単純で
Falling in love is so simple

316
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:07,173
だけど仕方ないでしょう？

317
00:28:07,173 --> 00:28:12,812
たとえいつか　信じていたものに
Even if one day, by the things I believed in

318

00:28:23,022 --> 00:28:27,794
どこまでも届いて
will reach everywhere

321
00:28:27,794 --> 00:28:31,231
結ぶ想い重ね集めて　痛みもさえも
Combining and gathering our feelings, even the pain

322
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:36,603
響いたメロディが　世界を駆け行こう
The echoing melody, let's run through the world

323
00:28:36,603 --> 00:28:42,542
未来を信じられる勇気に変えていく
Changing into courage to believe in the future

324
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:47,380

327
00:29:07,534 --> 00:29:12,672
無力さ　そんな矛盾抱えて
and helplessness, embracing such contradictions

328
00:29:12,672 --> 00:29:17,477
答えのない堂々巡りで
In an endless circle without an answer

329
00:29:17,477 --> 00:29:23,750

that's surely because of you

330
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:29,155

People, to live alone at any time

331
00:29:29,155 --> 00:29:34,360
抱え切れないほどの苦しみ背負って
carry more pain than they can handle

332
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,733
だから誰かのために生きる
That's why living for someone else

333
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:47,574
そんな気力になることも必要なのかも知れない
might be a necessary source of energy

334
00:29:47,574 --> 00:29:52,979
描いたストーリーが　この星を巡る
The story I drew travels around this planet

335
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:58,718
明日を愛していく　希望に連なる
Connected to the hope that will love tomorrow

336
00:29:58,718 --> 00:30:00,040
君の...
Your...

苦しみさえ置いてゆくよ
I'll even leave the pain behind

339
00:30:18,848 --> 00:30:24,048
もしもね 互いの道がバラバラで
If, you know, our paths were separate

340
00:30:24,248 --> 00:30:30,048
すれ違ってばかり そんな日が来ても
And we just kept passing each other by, even if such a day comes

341
00:30:30,248 --> 00:30:32,348
いつかまた
Someday again,

342
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,048

Since we rarely get to say "one, two!" together like this...

423
00:40:04,597 --> 00:40:06,464
確かに。
True.

424
00:40:06,464 --> 00:40:07,464
新鮮だった。
It felt fresh.

425
00:40:07,464 --> 00:40:08,830
新鮮ですね。
It really does.

426
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:09,864
ねー。
Right?

427
00:40:09,864 --> 00:40:10,797
改めてまして。
Once again...

428
00:40:10,797 --> 00:40:12,764
改めてまして、よろしくお願いします！
Once again, it's a pleasure to be here!

429
00:40:12,764 --> 00:40:15,197
先ほども呼んでいただいたんですけれども。
We were called up earlier as well.

430
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:16,230
そうね。
That's right.

431
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,297
2回目！よかったー！
A second time! I'm so glad!

432
00:40:18,297 --> 00:40:20,197
ありがとうございます！
Thank you so much!

433
00:40:20,197 --> 00:40:24,097
歌い上がってしまって、ハッハハってなっちゃったね。
We got so into the singing, we were all like, "Ha-ha-ha!"

434
00:40:24,097 --> 00:40:26,630
えー、3人では「恋情詩歌」と…
So, as a trio, we sang "Renjo Shika" and...

435
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,064
ね、「ツバキ」を。
...right, "Tsubaki."

436
00:40:28,064 --> 00:40:30,397
歌いましたけども、「ツバキ」がね、なんと！
We sang them, and "Tsubaki" was actually...

437
00:40:30,397 --> 00:40:32,730
ここ、YouTubeでは初！
...performed here on YouTube for the first time!

438
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,964
初お披露目ということで！
It was the first public performance!

439
00:40:34,964 --> 00:40:36,630
嬉しいー！
I'm so happy!

440
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,930
そうだよ！やっとだよ！
Exactly! Finally!

441
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,464
ね、初めて見る人間様もいるんじゃないですか？
I bet there are humans seeing it for the first time, right?

442
00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:41,897
絶対いるね。
Definitely.

443
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,264
ねー。そう。どうだったかな？
Yeah. So, how was it?

444
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:46,864
どうでした？どうでした？コメント欄で教えてくださいね。
What did you think? Let us know in the comments.

445
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:50,064
これ、難しいんだよね、意外と。
This is surprisingly difficult, you know.

446
00:40:50,064 --> 00:40:54,464
「恋情詩歌」も、 mecha 難しいんだよね。
"Renjo Shika" is also super difficult.

447
00:40:54,464 --> 00:40:58,264
一生懸命頑張って、間違ってないといいんですけども。
We tried our best, so I hope we didn't make any mistakes.

448
00:40:58,264 --> 00:41:00,664
いいとこだけ見てください。
Please only pay attention to the good parts.

449
00:41:00,664 --> 00:41:04,297
間違ってるなと思ったら、ちょっと見なかったことで。忘れてください。
If you think we messed up, just pretend you didn't see it. Please forget it.

450
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:10,064
いいとこだけ、お願いします！
Only the good parts, please!

451
00:41:10,064 --> 00:41:13,297
そして、なんか今日後ろに…
And also, there's something behind us today...

452
00:41:13,297 --> 00:41:15,630
そうなんですよ！見て！
That's right! Look!

453
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:18,930
4周年記念で、ぽよよん実装！
For the 4th anniversary, Poyoyo is here!

454
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,097
うわー！すごい！
Whoa! Amazing!

455
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:24,097
めっちゃ動いてるよ。
It's moving so much.

456
00:41:24,097 --> 00:41:27,530
DJぽよよ。すごーい！揺れとる揺れとる。
DJ Poyoyo. Incredible! It's swaying!

457
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:31,830
なんかさ、このぽよよさ、リハではなんかもうちょっと違ったんだよね。
You know, this Poyoyo was a bit different in rehearsal.

458
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,797
そうなんですよ。確かに。
That's true. Indeed.

459
00:41:33,797 --> 00:41:36,630
実はね、リハーサルではサングラスかけてて。
Actually, it was wearing sunglasses in rehearsal.

460
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,230
ああ、これ！これかけててね。
Ah, these! It was wearing these.

461
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,630
サングラスも…あ！動くんだよ、動く！
The sunglasses also—oh! They move, they move!

462
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:46,630
やばい、もう。これ、本番なくしたよね、リハで見て。
Oh my god. We decided to remove them for the show after seeing them in rehearsal.

463
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:51,364
そうなんだよね、あまりにも存在感が…
Yeah, its presence was just so...

464
00:41:51,364 --> 00:41:54,064
大きすぎて。確かに。
...overwhelming. Definitely.

465
00:41:54,064 --> 00:41:58,330
踊ってる最中、後ろでずっとさ、カメラに絶対入るぽよよ、みたいなって。
While we were dancing, Poyoyo was back there, definitely getting into the shot.

466
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:02,230
完全体ぽよ。笑ってできないっていう。
Perfect form Poyoyo. We couldn't stop laughing and keep performing.

467
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:07,230
笑ってできなくなっちゃったので、本番ではね、ちょっと外していただきました。
Since we couldn't help laughing, we had them removed for the actual performance.

468
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:11,497
チラチラ、チラチラ。可愛いけども。
Glancing back at it. It's cute, though.

469
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:15,864
めっちゃ可愛いけどねー。
It really is super cute.

470
00:42:15,864 --> 00:42:19,497
じゃあ、これから、ちょっとこの後どうする？焼肉でも食べに行く？
Well then, what should we do after this? Go eat some yakiniku?

471
00:42:19,497 --> 00:42:24,097
行きたい、行きたい！踊ったし、お腹空いちゃった。
I want to go! We danced, and now I'm hungry.

472
00:42:24,097 --> 00:42:27,464
あやめは？行きたいんだけど、まだこの後もあるんです。
What about you, Ayame? I want to go, but I still have more to do after this.

473
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:30,064
この後もあるの！？そう、この後も。
There's more?! Yes, more after this.

474
00:42:30,064 --> 00:42:35,397
じゃあ、この後もうちらで見守ってようか。いいね、見守ってよう。
In that case, let's keep watching over you. Sounds good, let's watch.

475
00:42:35,397 --> 00:42:39,197
じゃあ、ちょっと二人に見守ってもらおうかな。
Then, I guess I'll have you two watch over me.

476
00:42:39,197 --> 00:42:43,230
見守ってるぜ。頑張るよ、ありがとう！
We're watching. I'll do my best, thank you!

477
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:47,397
じゃあ、あっちで見守っとくか。行こっか。
Alright, let's head over there and watch. Let's go.

478
00:42:47,397 --> 00:42:51,730
行ってきまーす。ありがとうね、頑張ってね！
Off we go. Thanks for having us, good luck!

479
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:56,064
頑張るよー！バイバーイ！
I'll do my best! Bye-bye!

544
00:46:50,072 --> 00:46:53,072
嬉しい、ありがとうございます、来てくれて。
I'm happy, thank you for coming.

545
00:46:53,072 --> 00:46:58,572
あやめ先輩とこうしてお話ししたり、一緒にコラボするの初めてなんですよ。
This is the first time I've talked with Ayame-senpai like this and collaborated with her.

546
00:46:58,572 --> 00:47:05,072
えーやったー！めっちゃめっちゃ嬉しい。ありがとうございます。
Yay! I'm so, so happy. Thank you.

547
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:11,872
いや本当にね、あやめ先輩に誘ってもらった時、「え、マジ？」と思って。
No, really, when Ayame-senpai invited me, I was like, "Wait, seriously?"

548
00:47:11,872 --> 00:47:15,472
いやいや、余は誘いたかったんですよ。
No no, I really wanted to invite you.

549
00:47:15,472 --> 00:47:22,072
クロヱちゃんと可愛い曲を歌いたいって、3D配信を見た時から思ってたの、ずっと。余は。
I've always thought since seeing your 3D stream that I wanted to sing a cute song with Chloe-chan.

550
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:24,472
え、そう言ってくれてましたよね。
Wait, you said that before, didn't you?

551
00:47:24,472 --> 00:47:29,072
そうそう。やりたくて、クロヱちゃんに頑張ってお誘いして、一緒に踊ってもらいましたー！
Yeah. I wanted to, so I tried my best to invite Chloe-chan and had her dance with me!

552
00:47:29,072 --> 00:47:34,072
やったー！ありがとうございます、あやめ先輩！やったやった！
Yay! Thank you, Ayame-senpai! Yay yay!

553
00:47:34,072 --> 00:47:42,072
でも、あやめ先輩が沙花叉のこと大好きなのは、沙花叉も元々知ってたっていうか...
But, the fact that Ayame-senpai loves Sakamata is something Sakamata already knew...

554
00:47:42,072 --> 00:47:46,072
大好き...ですよね？
You love me... right?

555
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:48,072
う、うん...？
Uh, yeah...?

556
00:47:48,072 --> 00:47:50,072
あやめ先輩！
Ayame-senpai!

557
00:47:50,072 --> 00:47:52,072
大好きですよね？！
You love me, right?!

558
00:47:52,072 --> 00:47:54,072
これから仲良くなれますよね？！もっと仲良く...！
We can get along now, right?! Even better...!

559
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:57,072
ちょ、ちょっとよく分かんないかもしれない...！助けてー！
Wait, I might not really understand...! Help!

560
00:48:13,572 --> 00:48:19,472
あ、ちょっと君に伝えたい 何かがあったような

The other day, I listened to Lui-chan's 'Identity' cover, the one with Okayu-n.

702
00:57:41,888 --> 00:57:44,888
なかなか誘えていなくて、今日初めて呼べて嬉しい！
But I hadn't been able to, so I'm happy to finally have you here!

703
00:57:44,888 --> 00:57:47,388
あ～かわいい！何この子かわいいんだけど！
Ah~ so cute! What's with this girl, she's so cute!

704
00:57:47,388 --> 00:57:51,388
あとね、ポルカの歌ってみた聞いて、一緒にやりたいな～って思ったんだよね
And after listening to Polka's cover, I thought I wanted to do this together!

705
00:57:51,388 --> 00:57:54,088
かわいいんだけど！嬉しいんだけど！
She's so cute! I'm so happy!

706
00:57:54,088 --> 00:57:58,288
まさかこの曲一緒に歌えると思わなかったから、すごい嬉しいわ。本当にありがとうございます
I never thought we'd sing this song together, so I'm thrilled. Thank you so much!

707
00:57:58,288 --> 00:58:01,888
イェーイ！
Yay!

708
00:58:01,888 --> 00:58:05,888
スクショ、スクショ、スクショ、はい！
Screenshot, screenshot, screenshot, okay!

709
00:58:05,888 --> 00:58:09,188
本当にでもなんか、ありがとうございました。これからもなんか何かで一緒に
Really, thank you so much. Let's do something together again in the future!

710
00:58:09,188 --> 00:58:11,388
あ、はい、こちら名刺
Ah, yes, here's my business card!

711
00:58:11,388 --> 00:58:13,988
あ、こちら、ありがとうございます。受け取らせていただきます
Oh, thank you very much. I'll take it!

712
00:58:13,988 --> 00:58:17,188
ありがとうございました
Thank you very much!

713
00:58:17,188 --> 00:58:20,288
今日本当に、え？まだですよね？何で帰っちゃうの？
Today was really... wait, it's not over yet, right? Why are you leaving?

714
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:23,288
すみません、名刺受け取ってちょっと帰るかと思って
Sorry, I thought I'd leave after you took the card!

715
00:58:23,288 --> 00:58:26,388
名刺受け取ると帰るっていう感じなんですね
So it's like once the card is taken, you leave?

716
00:58:26,388 --> 00:58:29,388
今日は本当におめでとうございますということでね
Anyway, congratulations on today!

717
00:58:29,388 --> 00:58:32,488
何度も言われてるでしょうけど、本当すごい、今日いろんな方々がコラボされてて
I'm sure you've heard it many times, but it's amazing how many people are collabing today!

718
00:58:32,488 --> 00:58:35,088
そうなんですよね、もうこれが10曲目になるんですけど
That's true, this is already the 10th song!

719
00:58:35,088 --> 00:58:38,088
すっげーな！
That's incredible!

720
00:58:38,088 --> 00:58:41,288
まだまだ続きますので、あと2曲くらいかな？どうかな？
It's still continuing, maybe about 2 songs left? Who knows?

721
00:58:41,288 --> 00:58:42,888
言っちゃうんだｗ
You're just going to say it? lol

722
00:58:42,888 --> 00:58:44,888
3曲くらいかな？5曲かな？
Maybe 3? Or 5?

00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:47,788
うやむやにｗ じゃあまだ見てね～
Keeping it vague lol! Well, please keep watching~

724
00:58:47,788 --> 00:58:50,888

じゃあありがとうございました！この後も見てね！
Well, thank you so much! Please keep watching after this too!

726
00:58:53,088 --> 00:58:56,288
君もそうバイバイじゃないでしょ、ポルカにどっちかっていうとバイバイでしょ
You shouldn't be saying goodbye too, you're saying goodbye to Polka, right?

727
00:58:56,288 --> 00:59:00,088
ありがとねー！この後も楽しんでねー！
Thanks! Enjoy the rest of the show too!

728

昨日歌った涙色も
Even the tear colors sung yesterday

732
00:59:36,488 --> 00:59:38,988
ありでいいんじゃないね
It's fine to have them, right?

00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:53,888
コツは楽しんで楽しもう
The trick is to have fun and enjoy

739
00:59:53,888 --> 00:59:56,388
もちろんなんでもありです当然でしょ
Of course, anything goes, it's natural right?

740
00:59:56,388 --> 01:00:00,088
とにかく二人の心が繋いでいく
Anyway, our hearts will stay connected

741
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,496
...なっちゃうね
...it happens.

742
01:00:01,896 --> 01:00:03,896

忘れないで君のBGM
Don't forget, your BGM

744
01:00:06,896 --> 01:00:08,896
あまりにありに繋がれたのなら
If we were too closely connected

745
01:00:09,196 --> 01:00:11,796
それじゃみんな宴の幕開けだ！
Then everyone, it's the start of the banquet!

746

もっともっと溶けちゃうくらい
More and more, until we're about to melt

755
01:00:34,596 --> 01:00:35,496
いっせーので歌え！ (ちゃちゃちゃ！)

763
01:00:55,896 --> 01:00:58,296
きらめく空をなぞったなら
If you trace the sparkling sky

764
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,896
ほんのちょっと寂しくなるね
It gets a little bit lonely

765
01:01:01,396 --> 01:01:03,596
それじゃケーキもおひとつ
Then, have a piece of cake too

766
01:01:03,996 --> 01:01:06,096
なんとなく笑えてきたね (おっけー！)
Somehow, I've started to laugh (OK!)

767
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:08,796
Ding Dong Dang 響くような
Like Ding Dong Dang is echoing

768
01:01:09,196 --> 01:01:11,396
耳澄ませば君のBGM
If you listen closely, it's your BGM

769
01:01:11,696 --> 01:01:13,996
お腹の合図が聞こえたら
When you hear the signal from your stomach

770
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:16,896
それじゃみんな宴の再開だ！
Then everyone, it's time to resume the banquet!

785
01:02:11,096 --> 01:02:13,396
わっしょいわっしょい踊り明かそう (あそれ よいよい！)
Wasshoi wasshoi, let's dance all night (A-sore yoi yoi!)

786
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:16,096
ポッピンキャンディ☆ピーチ！ねえ聞いてよDreamer!
Poppin' Candy Peach! Hey, listen, Dreamer!

01:02:22,096 --> 01:02:24,096
もっともっとうるさいくらい
More and more, until it's almost too loud

790
01:02:24,196 --> 01:02:25,096
いっせーので歌え！ (ちゃちゃちゃ！)

799
01:02:52,596 --> 01:02:57,496
ということで、今日みこちに一緒に歌って踊ってもらいました！
And so, I had Miko-chi sing and dance with me today!

800
01:02:57,496 --> 01:02:58,296
ありがとうございます！
Thank you so much!

801
01:02:58,396 --> 01:03:00,696
ありがとう呼んでくれて！嬉しいです本当に。
Thank you for inviting me! I'm really happy.

802
01:03:00,696 --> 01:03:03,296
嬉しいです本当に。可愛いなあ。
I'm really happy too. You're so cute.

803
01:03:03,396 --> 01:03:05,196
今日もかわよだなあ。
You're cute today too.

804
01:03:05,396 --> 01:03:07,896
え、ありがとう。みこちも可愛いよ。
Eh, thanks. Miko-chi is cute too.

805
01:03:07,896 --> 01:03:10,096
可愛いよ。そんなことない！
You're cute. That's not true!

806
01:03:10,096 --> 01:03:11,196
可愛いね！
You're cute!

807
01:03:11,196 --> 01:03:12,496
そんなことない！あやめちゃん可愛いね！
That's not true! Ayame-chan is cute!

808
01:03:12,496 --> 01:03:13,596
あ、本当？可愛いね！
Ah, really? You're cute!

809
01:03:14,696 --> 01:03:17,396
てかあれだよね、みこちとは新衣装ぶり？こないだの。
By the way, it's been since your new outfit reveal, right? Recently.

810
01:03:17,596 --> 01:03:19,496
あ、そうだね。みこの新衣装ライブに。
Ah, that's right. For Miko's new outfit live.

811
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:22,596
ねー、可愛かったよ。でも二人はちょっと初めてだよね。
Yeah, you were cute. But it's our first time as a duo, right?

812
01:03:22,696 --> 01:03:26,596
そうなんだよ。二人はね、初めてなんですよ。意外とね。
That's right. It's the first time for just the two of us. Surprisingly.

813
01:03:27,196 --> 01:03:30,496
え、なぜあやめちゃんはみこのこと呼んでくれたの？
Eh, why did Ayame-chan invite Miko?

814
01:03:30,896 --> 01:03:33,296
え、実はね、あの...
Eh, actually, well...

815
01:03:33,396 --> 01:03:38,096
ポッピンキャンディ☆フィーバーを聴いた時に、あ、絶対にみこちに合うって思ったんですよ。
When I heard 'Poppin' Candy Fever', I thought, 'Ah, this definitely suits Miko-chi.'

816
01:03:38,296 --> 01:03:42,596
えー！だから一緒に歌いたいって思って誘っちゃった。
Eh-! So I thought I wanted to sing it together and invited you.

817
01:03:43,096 --> 01:03:45,396
やったー！ありがとう！
Yay! Thank you!

818
01:03:45,496 --> 01:03:48,396
じゃ、あやめちゃんはみこになつき始めてきたという...
So, that means Ayame-chan has started to get attached to Miko...

819
01:03:48,496 --> 01:03:50,596
え、そういう目線なの？そういう目線なのよ。
Eh, is that how you see it? That's how I see it.

820
01:03:50,796 --> 01:03:53,396
うん。お友達みたいな感じではなく。
Yeah. Not like we're friends or anything.

821
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:56,596
いやなんか愛玩動物みたいな。
No, it's more like a pet.

822
01:03:56,696 --> 01:03:59,896
あ、そういう感じなのね。やったー。愛玩動物みたいな。
Ah, I see. Yay. Like a pet.

823
01:04:00,296 --> 01:04:03,296
あの、みことあやめちゃんて意外とシナジーあるよね。
Miko and Ayame-chan have a surprising amount of synergy, don't we?

824
01:04:03,396 --> 01:04:06,096
意外とね。ちょっとカメラさんちょっと引きで見えますか？
Surprisingly. Mr. Cameraman, can we get a wide shot?

825
01:04:06,396 --> 01:04:10,096
ピンクで意外と可愛いんですよ二人。
The pink is surprisingly cute on us.

826
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,796
ね、可愛い。色合いが良きです。
Yeah, cute. The colors are good.

827
01:04:12,896 --> 01:04:16,896
あとはあれだよね、鬼とお巫女だからね。
Also, it's because it's an Oni and a Miko.

828
01:04:17,396 --> 01:04:20,596
あ、もしかしてこれ退治される側ですか？
Ah, is this the 'getting exorcised' side?

829
01:04:20,896 --> 01:04:23,296
鬼は外！福は内！
Out with the demons! In with good fortune!

830
01:04:24,096 --> 01:04:31,096
わー！ありがとう！ありがとうございます！このあとも見てね！
Wow! Thank you! Thank you so much! Keep watching after this too!

831
01:04:48,896 --> 01:04:54,296
わたしの一番かわいいところ
My Cutest Part

832
01:04:54,596 --> 01:04:56,096
あれ、気づいちゃいましたか？
Oh, did you notice?

833
01:04:56,296 --> 01:05:00,096
生まれて30秒で最初に聞いた言葉...
The first words I heard thirty seconds after being born...

834
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:03,604
当たり前にそれ覚えてないけど嬉しかったはず
I don't remember it clearly, of course, but I should have been happy

835
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:07,504
今でもだいたいのことは変わってないって言うこっちゃ
It means that mostly things haven't changed even now

836
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:11,004
中身は変わっていますのでその辺でも評価
Since the inside has changed, please evaluate that part too

837
01:05:11,004 --> 01:05:11,804
お願い
Please

838
01:05:11,804 --> 01:05:15,104
携帯のアンテナを光らせて
Light up your phone antenna

839
01:05:15,104 --> 01:05:18,904
それが超キュートなあの頃だって知っていたり
Knowing that it's that super cute time

840
01:05:18,904 --> 01:05:22,104
って言うかアンテナって何って言ってるの？
Wait, what do you mean by 'antenna'?

841
01:05:22,104 --> 01:05:25,304
私に付き合ってくれるの好き
I like it when you hang out with me

842
01:05:25,304 --> 01:05:27,604
逆にでも私のどこが好き？
But on the other hand, what do you like about me?

843
01:05:27,604 --> 01:05:28,504
ねぇねぇねぇ！
Hey, hey, hey!

844
01:05:28,504 --> 01:05:32,004
私の1番かわいいところに気付いてる？
Have you noticed my cutest part?

845
01:05:32,004 --> 01:05:35,504
そんな君が1番すごいすごいよすごすぎる
You're the most amazing, amazing, too amazing

846
01:05:35,504 --> 01:05:39,004
そして君が知ってる私が1番かわいいな
And the me that you know is the cutest

847
01:05:39,004 --> 01:05:42,604
私もそれに気付いた
I noticed that too

848
01:05:42,604 --> 01:05:46,504
だからそれかわいい あれかわいいなんて
So saying that's cute, this is cute

849
01:05:46,504 --> 01:05:50,204
誰かいい それかわいいなんて
Saying someone's nice, that's cute

850
01:05:50,204 --> 01:05:56,304
言わないで 私以外なんてやだ
Don't say it, I don't want anyone but me

851
01:05:56,304 --> 01:05:58,604
なんてありえない
That's impossible

852
01:06:12,404 --> 01:06:13,804
私、気付いちゃいました
I noticed

853
01:06:13,804 --> 01:06:17,404
毎日何十度も褒められまくったお菓子は
Sweets that were praised dozens of times every day

854
01:06:17,404 --> 01:06:20,704
他よりちょっと甘くなるって前に聞いた
I heard before that they get a little sweeter than others

855
01:06:20,704 --> 01:06:21,304
そんな...
Like that...

856
01:06:21,304 --> 01:06:24,704
さすがにそれは引くんだけど私は言われたいタイプですし
That's a bit much, but I'm the type who wants to be told

857
01:06:24,704 --> 01:06:27,804
もっと分かりやすくていいんだよ お待ちしてらっす
It's okay to be more obvious, I'm waiting

858
01:06:27,804 --> 01:06:28,604
お願い
Please

859
01:06:28,604 --> 01:06:31,904
何しててもどんな顔見せてても
No matter what I'm doing or what kind of face I'm showing

860
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:35,504
いつも超キュートだって確信してるのは
The reason I'm sure I'm always super cute is

861
01:06:35,504 --> 01:06:39,404
なんだかさ 知らなかったタイプの運命の人なの？
Somehow, are you a type of fated person I didn't know?

862
01:06:39,404 --> 01:06:41,104
付き合ったよ無理ごめん
I went out with you, no way sorry

863
01:06:41,104 --> 01:06:44,304
逆にでもそれより楽しいよ
But conversely, it's more fun than that

864
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:45,004
ねぇねぇねぇ！
Hey, hey, hey!

865
01:06:45,004 --> 01:06:48,604
私の1番かわいいところをよく見てる
You're looking closely at my cutest part

866
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:52,304
そんな君が本当に超ラッキーな人すぎる
You're really just too super lucky

867
01:06:52,304 --> 01:06:55,804
そして君が何年経ってもそう思えるように
And so that you'll feel that way no matter how many years pass

868
01:06:55,804 --> 01:07:00,104
私はそれに気付いた
I noticed that

869
01:07:15,404 --> 01:07:19,004
会えないときもどんな表情してるかとか
When we can't meet, what kind of expression I'm making

870
01:07:19,004 --> 01:07:22,504
気持ち悪くない想像しちゃうかな
I might imagine things that aren't gross

871
01:07:22,504 --> 01:07:26,204
それかわいい あれかわいいよって
Saying that's cute, this is cute

872
01:07:26,204 --> 01:07:30,004

Well, for this song, I chose these members because I felt they would absolutely suit it, so I'm very happy.

904
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:46,904
1番だれがかわいいのかなぁ？
I wonder who is the cutest?

905
01:09:46,904 --> 01:09:48,604
え、あやめ先輩でしょ！
Eh, it's Ayame-senpai, right!

906
01:09:48,604 --> 01:09:52,104
え、余もかわいい！？
Eh, am I cute too!?

907
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:55,804
負けた... 負けちゃった...
I lost... I lost...

908
01:09:55,804 --> 01:09:59,104
や、でもあやめ先輩、今回のライブ全体通して船長最近よく見るちょっと...
Well, but Ayame-senpai, throughout this whole live, Senchou has been seeing you often lately...

909
01:10:00,212 --> 01:10:01,412
TikTok...

910
01:10:01,412 --> 01:10:02,712

分かりましたか？ちょっとTikTokで流行ってる曲を詰め込んだんですけど。
Did you notice? I packed in a lot of songs that are trending on TikTok.

913
01:10:06,612 --> 01:10:08,612
いいじゃないですか！
Isn't that nice!

914
01:10:08,612 --> 01:10:10,612
流行りに乗ってる！
You're following the trends!

915
01:10:10,612 --> 01:10:13,612
さすがですね。すごいですね！
As expected. That's amazing!

916
01:10:14,112 --> 01:10:18,112
しかもね、気づいたんですけど、このメンバー、赤と青がね、分かれてるの！
And also, I noticed something. These members are split into Red and Blue!

917
01:10:18,112 --> 01:10:20,112
あ、本当だ！本当だ！
Oh, you're right! You're right!

918

めっちゃ一緒。見て見て見て！
It's a perfect match. Look, look, look!

でもほら、なんか、可愛いうちら、ほら。イェーイ。色気、色気。
But look, we're the cute ones. See? Yeah, sexy, sexy.

922
01:10:33,112 --> 01:10:37,112
ちょっと、色気、色気、色気組だね。これはちょっと鬼組だね。
Yeah, we're the 'alluring' team, aren't we? This is quite an 'oni' combo.

923
01:10:37,112 --> 01:10:40,112
ちょっと、これはちょっと、許せないでしょ。
Wait, we can't let that slide.

924
01:10:40,112 --> 01:10:43,112
はっけよーい、のこった、のこった、のこった！うりゃー！

937
01:11:57,112 --> 01:12:05,112

I won't accept comments like 'She looks a bit different than usual'... even though she does.

Everyone was so cute, right? They all worked so hard singing and dancing.

965
