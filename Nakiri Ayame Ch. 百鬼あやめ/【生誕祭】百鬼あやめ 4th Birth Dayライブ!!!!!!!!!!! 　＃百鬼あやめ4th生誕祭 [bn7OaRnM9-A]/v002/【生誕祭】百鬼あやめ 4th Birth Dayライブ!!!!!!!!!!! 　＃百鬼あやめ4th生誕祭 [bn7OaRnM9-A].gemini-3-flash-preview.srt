4
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,300
私のこと知ってますか？
Do you know about me?

5
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,800
可愛く見えてますか？
Do I look cute to you?

6
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
私の歌どうだろうな
I wonder how my singing is.

7
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,300
うまく歌えてますか？
Am I singing it well?

8
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,600
衣装だとかメイクだとか
The outfit, the makeup...

9
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,300
可愛く見えてますか？
...do I look cute to you?

10
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,200
振り付けとかファンサだとか
The choreography, the fan service...

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
喜んでもらえますか？
...do you enjoy them?

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,300
手は冷たくなって
My hands are getting cold...

13
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,200
足は震える
...and my legs are trembling.

14
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,300
それでも戦いたい
Even so, I want to fight.

15
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,800
アイドルだから
Because I'm an idol.

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,800
バカにする奴は嫌いだ
I hate those who make fun of us.

17
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,800
見下されるのも嫌いだ
I hate being looked down upon too.

18
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,800
アイドルなんかって言葉を
Words like "it's just an idol"...

19
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,800
見てもいないくせに言うな
...don't say them if you haven't even looked.

20
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,800
頑張りも当然と言うな
Don't say hard work is a given.

21
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,800
イメージとか強制するな
Don't force your image on me.

22
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,700
アイドルなんかって言葉を
The phrase "it's just an idol"...

23
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,800
この世で一番大嫌いだ
...I hate it more than anything in this world.

24
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,800
プライベート見えないから
Since you can't see my private life,

25
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,400
分からないと思います
I don't think you'd understand.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,400
性格とか悪い方です
My personality is on the bad side.

27
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,200
騙しちゃっていますか？
Am I deceiving you?

28
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,200
でも本気です 本気なんです
But I'm serious, I'm really serious.

29
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,400
ありのままの私を
Please like me just as I am,

30
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,400
好きになって推してください
and support me.

31
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,400
それってワガママですか？
Is that being selfish?

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,300
きっと可愛くない
I'm sure it's not cute,

33
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,000
ぜんぶわかってる
I understand everything.

34
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,800
それでも好かれていたい
Even so, I want to be liked.

35
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,800
アイドルだから
Because I'm an idol.

36
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,800
皮肉言う奴は嫌いだ
I hate those who are cynical.

37
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,800
言い訳ばかりも嫌いだ
I also hate making excuses.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,500
こんなもんかって言葉を
Words like "is this it?"...

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,500
軽々しく口にするな
...don't say them so lightly.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,500
勝手に限界決めるな
Don't decide my limits for me.

41
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,400
笑いものになんてするな
Don't make me a laughingstock.

42
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,100
アイドルなんかって言葉を
The phrase "it's just an idol"...

43
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,100
この世で一番大嫌いだ
...I hate it more than anything in this world.

44
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,800
向かい風を切り裂け
Cut through the headwind.

45
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,300
誇り高きアイドル
A proud idol.

46
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,800
目指そうぜ
Let's aim for it.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,300
応援がなければ活動できない
I can't do this without your support.

48
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,400
好きなことばかりじゃ生きてはいけない
I can't live just by doing what I like.

49
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,300
元気あげるはずが もらってばかりだし
I'm supposed to give energy, but I'm always receiving it.

50
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,300
恩返しできる日まで
Until the day I can repay you,

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,800
待ってて
please wait.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,300
完璧だと思っても
Even if I think it's perfect,

53
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,000
飽きられちゃっても
or if people get tired of me,

54
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,800
それでも笑っていたい
Even so, I want to keep smiling.

55
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,800
アイドルだから
Because I'm an idol.

56
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,333
...愛があって
...with love,

57
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,033
スタッフさんの愛があって
with the staff's love,

58
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:05,133
いつも家族の愛があって
with my family's love always,

59
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:07,433
生きてる
I live as an

60
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,133
アイドル
idol.

61
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:12,733
馬鹿にする奴は嫌いだ
I hate those who make fun of us.

62
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:15,933
見下されるのも嫌いだ
I hate being looked down upon too.

63
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:19,433
アイドルなんかという言葉を
Don't say things like "just an idol"

64
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:21,033
見てもいないくせに言うな
when you haven't even seen us.

65
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,433
頑張りは当然と言うな
Don't say hard work is to be expected.

66
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:27,133
イメージとか強要するな
Don't force images on us.

67
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:30,233
アイドルなんかという言葉は
The words "just an idol" are

68
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:33,433
この世で一番大嫌いな
what I hate most in this world...

69
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:56,433
君にBaby Sweet Berry Love
To you, Baby Sweet Berry Love.

70
00:05:54,133 --> 00:06:05,033
Baby Sweet Berry Love
作詞：山崎寛子 作曲・編曲：俊龍
Baby Sweet Berry Love
Lyrics: Hiroko Yamazaki, Composition/Arrangement: Shunryu

71
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:59,233
本当の気持ちだけ
If only we could

72
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:02,133
分け合えたらいいのにな
share our true feelings.

73
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:05,233
願いを叶えてよ
Please grant my wish.

74
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:19,433
大好きのハートも
Even the "I love you" hearts,

75
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:22,533
ごめんねの涙も
even the "I'm sorry" tears,

76
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:25,533
本当は素直に
I actually wanted to

77
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,533
見せたくて
show them honestly.

78
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:30,533
伝えたい思いと
The feelings I want to convey

79
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:33,733
裏腹の態度
and my contradictory attitude.

80
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:36,533
上手になれない
A state of mind

81
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:39,533
心模様
that I can't get right.

82
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,133
どうして 空回りに
Why does my heart

83
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:44,733
胸がギュッとなる
tighten in vain?

84
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:48,333
近い距離がもどかしいよね
This close distance is frustrating, isn't it?

85
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:52,233
届けたいの
I want to reach you.

86
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:55,733
君とBaby Sweet Berry Love
With you, Baby Sweet Berry Love.

87
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:58,733
きっとぎこちなくて
It's a bit awkward,

88
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:01,433
でもまっすぐに見つめて
but look straight at me.

89
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:04,433
素顔写したい
I want to show my true face.

90
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:07,733
もっとBaby Sweet Berry Love
More Baby Sweet Berry Love.

91
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:10,533
せめて君の前では
At least in front of you,

92
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:13,233
笑っておこうぜ溢れた
let's keep smiling, it's overflowing.

93
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:16,133
ありのままでいたい
I want to stay as I am.

94
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:19,033
だからBaby Sweet Berry Love
So Baby Sweet Berry Love,

95
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:22,333
一緒に始めよう
let's start together.

96
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:35,433
散らばれたハートを
I try to look for

97
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:38,633
探してみるけれど
the scattered hearts,

98
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:41,533
本当は自分の
but they're actually

99
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:44,333
奥にある
deep inside myself.

100
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,333
まるで寂しいのに
Like a lost cat

101
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,333
すました迷い猫
acting cool despite being lonely.

102
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,033
こぼれた夕日に
I get emotional

103
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:55,833
ジーンとしちゃう
at the spilling sunset.

104
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,533
不意な優しさに
The sound of my heart

105
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:01,233
はしゃぐ胸の音
frolicking at unexpected kindness.

106
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:04,633
ドタバタとかカラフルでキュンと
It's noisy and colorful and my heart throbs,

107
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:08,833
満ちてゆくの
and it fills up.

108
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,033
君とBaby Sweet Berry Love
With you, Baby Sweet Berry Love.

109
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,133
感情のままだけ
The more I cherish just

110
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:17,833
大事にすればするほど
the emotions as they are,

111
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,833
ごまかしてしまうの
the more I end up hiding them.

112
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,033
だけどBaby Sweet Berry Love
But Baby Sweet Berry Love,

113
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:27,133
自分の心まで
when I don't even know

114
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:29,833
分からない時は君と
my own heart, I want to

115
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,633
確かめ合いたいの
confirm it with you.

116
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:35,633
だからBaby Sweet Berry Love
So Baby Sweet Berry Love,

117
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:38,833
同じ場所にいたい
I want to be in the same place.

118
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:52,733
君にBaby Sweet Berry Love
To you, Baby Sweet Berry Love.

119
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,733
自分を守るより
There's something more important

120
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:58,633
大切なことがあるの
than protecting myself,

121
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:02,333
こんなに近くに
right here so close.

122
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,733
君とBaby Sweet Berry Love
With you, Baby Sweet Berry Love.

123
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:08,733
きっとぎこちなくて
It's a bit awkward,

124
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:11,433
でもまっすぐに見つめて
but look straight at me.

125
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:14,433
素顔写したい
I want to show my true face.

126
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:17,633
もっとBaby Sweet Berry Love
More Baby Sweet Berry Love.

127
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:20,333
せめて君の前では
At least in front of you,

128
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,033
笑っておこうぜ溢れた
let's keep smiling, it's overflowing.

129
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:25,833
ありのままでいたい
I want to stay as I am.

130
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,833
だからBaby Sweet Berry Love
So Baby Sweet Berry Love,

131
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,733
こんなに好きだよ
I love you this much.

132
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:51,333
ずっとBaby Sweet Berry Love
Always Baby Sweet Berry Love.

133
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:18,245
伝え合った 心の温度を
The warmth of our hearts we shared,

134
00:10:18,845 --> 00:10:23,845
そっと 大事そうに 抱え歩いていた
I walked, gently clutching it as if it were precious

135
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:29,545
答えのない 願いの中で
Within a wish that has no answer,

136
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:34,545
言葉は 未来 変えて
words change the future

137
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:39,545
幼い頃 ずっと 夢に見ていた
Something I’d dreamed of since I was a child

138
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:43,045
私には まだ 遠いけど
It’s still out of reach for me, but...

139
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:46,345
君がいれば
...if you are here,

140
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:51,245
少しは強くなれる気がして
I feel like I can become a little stronger

141
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:56,545
明日の色を重ねる歌
A song that layers the colors of tomorrow

142
00:10:57,145 --> 00:11:02,145
呼んだ希望辿って 止めた世界を超えた
Following the hope I called for, I surpassed the frozen world

143
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:07,445
諦めない想い いつしか心繋げた
Feelings that won't give up eventually connected our hearts

144
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:13,345
泣いていたって笑って 明日迎えに行こう
Even if we were crying, let's smile and go greet tomorrow

145
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:17,845
決めた誓い辛くて 倒れても
Even if the oath I made is painful and I fall...

146
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:25,045
君のココロを守るため
...it's all to protect your heart

147
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:41,545
記憶のない 時の流れに
In the flow of time where memories are absent,

148
00:11:41,845 --> 00:11:47,445
きっと 求めていた 暖かさはあって
the warmth I was seeking must surely be there

149
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:52,545
包まれた 瞬間すべての
At the moment I was enveloped, all my...

150
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:57,545
想いは 君へ巡る
...feelings came circling back to you

151
00:11:57,945 --> 00:12:03,245
空に向かって 走り手にした
I ran toward the sky and grasped

152
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:08,545
幾つもの 尊い光 胸にしまって
many precious lights, tucking them into my chest

153
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:13,845
私の中の 輝きに変え
Turning them into a radiance within me,

154
00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:19,445
迷いを 全部払って飛ぼう
I'll cast away all hesitation and fly

155
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:25,445
正解の見えない 入り組んだ迷路を抜け
Escaping the intricate maze where the right answer is hidden

156
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:31,045
君が流した涙で 心目覚めた
My heart was awakened by the tears you shed

157
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:36,745
そして知った世界は こんなにもまだ綺麗で
And the world I came to know is still so beautiful

158
00:12:36,945 --> 00:12:40,845
新しい可能性を 生むだろう
It will surely give birth to new possibilities

159
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:49,045
時のカケラの 願いから
From a wish born of a fragment of time

160
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:03,445
救い信じて 溢れた想い
Believing in salvation, these overflowing feelings

161
00:13:03,745 --> 00:13:08,545
確かな 始まりに立って
Stand at a certain beginning

162
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:14,245
君の笑顔 取り戻すよ
I will take back your smile,

163
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:20,045
真実の 奇跡になって
becoming a true miracle

164
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:27,445
呼んだ希望辿って 止めた世界を超えた
Following the hope I called for, I surpassed the frozen world

165
00:13:27,645 --> 00:13:32,745
諦めない想い いつしか心繋げた
Feelings that won't give up eventually connected our hearts

166
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:38,645
泣いていたって笑って 明日迎えに行こう
Even if we were crying, let's smile and go greet tomorrow

167
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:43,145
決めた誓い辛くて 倒れても
Even if the oath I made is painful and I fall...

168
00:13:43,245 --> 00:13:48,545
君のココロを守るため
...it's all to protect your heart

169
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,545
君の
To your...

170
00:13:54,445 --> 00:14:02,045
そばにいよう
...side, I will stay

171
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:26,545
いつの間にか見つけてた 遠い夢
A distant dream I found before I knew it

172
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:31,545
一人じゃ見えなかった景色
A scenery I couldn't have seen alone

173
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:37,045
波打つ風の音 加速していく想いに
To the sound of the surging wind and accelerating feelings,

174
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:41,545
戸惑いを覚えた
I felt a sense of bewilderment

175
00:14:42,545 --> 00:14:46,845
ずっと追いかけた 理想の姿は
The ideal self I've always chased

176
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:52,045
まだ届かなくて 遠いけど
is still out of reach and far away, but...

177
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:57,345
きっとこの瞬間を かけがえないみんなで
Surely, this moment, with everyone who is irreplaceable...

178
00:14:57,545 --> 00:14:59,045
共に行こう
...let's go together

179
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:02,157
手を繋いで 3, 2, 1
Hands held together, 3, 2, 1

180
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:05,207
輝き宿して
With a glow dwelling within

181
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:10,857
夢の場所へ 駆け抜けていく
We'll run through to the place of our dreams

182
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:15,707
僕たちの青春の光は
The light of our youth

183
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:19,507
誰にも止められないよ
Cannot be stopped by anyone

184
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:22,507
笑い合う分だけ 優しく
As much as we laugh together, gently

185
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:25,007
こぼれる涙さえ
Even the falling tears

186
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,257
ほら 輝かせ
Look, I'll make them shine

187
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:29,507
明日へ運ぶから
And carry them to tomorrow

188
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:32,457
君の隣へ
To your side

189
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:37,357
僕たちは世界を超えていく
We will cross over the world

190
00:15:37,507 --> 00:15:39,457
迎えに行くよ
I'm coming to get you

191
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:43,107

Even the yet unseen tomorrow

00:15:43,107 --> 00:15:46,007
キラめきに変えてきっと
I'll surely turn it into a sparkle

193
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:49,182
僕たちが 未来へと
Because we toward the future

194
00:15:50,107 --> 00:15:52,507
連れて行くから！
Will take you there!

195
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:04,307
背伸びして手を伸ばす 憧れの
Stretching out my hand to reach my aspiration

196
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:09,357
行先示す星になろう
I'll become the star that shows the way

197
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:14,407
躓くその度に 手を差し伸べ合えたら
If we can lend a hand every time we stumble

198
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:19,507
すぐに届くはずさ
It should reach us soon

199
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:24,457
そっと踏み出した 小さな勇気が
The small courage I softly stepped out with

200
00:16:25,157 --> 00:16:29,907
もう 消えないように 繋げよう
Let's connect it so it never fades away

201
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:35,457
不安も愛しさも 大切に抱きしめて
Embracing both anxiety and love dearly

202
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:37,507
共にいくよ
Let's go together

203
00:16:37,507 --> 00:16:39,457
目を合わせて 3, 2, 1
Eyes meeting, 3, 2, 1

204
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:43,157
晴れ渡る希望へ
Toward a clear, bright hope

205
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:47,907
飛び出せるよ 突き抜けていく
We can leap out, we'll break through

206
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:53,182
僕たちの透き通る決意は
Our transparent determination

207
00:16:53,707 --> 00:16:57,007
まだまだ止められないよ
Still cannot be stopped

208
00:16:57,507 --> 00:17:00,207
ありきたりな今日こそ
Precisely because it's an ordinary today

209
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:03,007
ドキドキに変えてもっと
Let's turn it into more excitement

210
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:06,207
僕たちが いつまでも
Because we will always

211
00:17:07,182 --> 00:17:09,507
背中を押すから！
Push you from behind!

212
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:33,757
ずっと一人で描いてた キャンバス
The canvas I've been drawing on alone all this time

213
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:37,507
いつからか 色彩(ライト)になって
At some point, it became colors of light

214
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:40,457
また少しずつ 芽生えた
Again, little by little, what blossomed

215
00:17:40,457 --> 00:17:43,757
「大好き」を紡ぎ
Spinning these 'loves' together

216
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:48,857
どこまでも高く
Soaring ever higher

217
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:54,707
あすいろの空へ 駆け抜けていく
Toward the azure sky, we'll run through

218

ほら 輝かせ
Look, I'll make them shine

223

明日へ運ぶから
And carry them to tomorrow

224
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:16,907
君の隣へ
To your side

00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:04,357
よしよしよし...
There, there, there...

242
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:06,207
幸せ...
I'm so happy...

243
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:09,357
ありがとね、二人とも集まってくれて、ありがとうございます。
Thank you both for gathering here, thank you so much.

244
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,557
いやいやいや...
No, no, no...

245
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:11,507
本当にね。
Really.

246
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:12,407
可愛いねぇ。
So cute.

247
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:13,407
幸せ...
So happy...

248
00:19:14,107 --> 00:19:16,907
よしよしよしよしよし...

幸せ...
So happy...

250
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:21,107
というわけで今回は、あすいろClearSkyだったんだ。
So this time, it was Asuiro Clear Sky.

251
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:22,457
え、なんかさ、
Well, you see,

252
00:19:22,907 --> 00:19:24,007
ちょっと、君たちさ、
Listen, you guys,

253
00:19:24,107 --> 00:19:24,507
お？
Oh?

254
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:27,207
だいぶ「百花繚乱花吹雪」をやってきたじゃない？
We've done 'Hyakka Ryouran Hanafubuki' quite a lot, right?

255
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,707
やりましたー！踊りまくりました！
We did! We danced like crazy!

256
00:19:29,707 --> 00:19:30,607
踊りまくりましたよねー。
We really did, didn't we?

257
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:31,107
そうですね。
That's true.

258
00:19:31,107 --> 00:19:33,757
だったので、ちょっと、新しい歌を3人で歌ったことない、
So, I thought I'd like for the three of us

259
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:37,507
3人でね、歌いたいなと思って、
To sing a new song we haven't done together before.

260
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:40,507
おおー！なるほどねー！
Oh! I see!

261
00:19:41,907 --> 00:19:44,807
で、ちょっとお家でね、あすいろClearSkyを聴いていた時に、
And when I was listening to Asuiro Clear Sky at home,

262
00:19:45,357 --> 00:19:45,907
ほう。
Hmm.

263
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:47,407
「あれ？」
'Wait a minute?'

264
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:48,807
お？
Oh?

265
00:19:48,907 --> 00:19:51,107
「百花繚乱チームで歌ったら...」
'If the Hyakka Ryouran team sang this...'

266
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:51,807
お？
Oh?

267
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,057
「エモいんじゃねーか？」と思って！
'Wouldn't it be really touching?' I thought!

268
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:55,907
おおー、エモい！エモいよ！
Oh, it is! It's so touching!

269
00:19:56,307 --> 00:19:58,807
あとさ、声のバランスがすごい3人は...
Also, the vocal balance between the three of us...

270
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:02,069
いい感じにね、合わさるので、
They go together nicely, so...

271
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:04,569
おお〜
Ooh~

272
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,569
とても良いのではないのでしょうか、と思って選びました。
I thought it would be very good, so I chose it.

273
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:09,069
イエーイ！
Yay!

274
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:11,869
わざわざありがとうございます。歌ってくれて。
Thank you for taking the time to sing with me.

275
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:13,869
いやいや。ありがとう。
No, no. Thank you.

276
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:15,069
ありがとうね。誘ってくれて。
Thank you. For inviting us.

277
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:16,869
誕生日おめでとう！
Happy birthday!

278
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:18,069
ありがとうございます！
Thank you very much!

279
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:20,569
またなんかね、こんな感じのまた後でわちゃわちゃ...
Maybe we can have another chaotic time like this later...

280
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:22,569
そうだね。3人で。
Right. The three of us.

281
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:24,069
どこに...
Where...

282
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:27,569
なんか、え？3人いる、え？
Wait, huh? There are three of us? Huh?

283
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:29,569
なんかね、百花繚乱みたいなね。
Like "Hyakkaryouran," you know?

284
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:31,569
なんかね、覚えがあるよね。
Yeah, it feels familiar.

285
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:33,069
こういう...
This kind of...

286
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:35,069
こういう踊り、あれ？あれれ？
This dance... wait? Huh?

287
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:37,569
あれ？なんか...
Wait? Something...

288
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,069
なんか、またあったらいいよね。
It would be nice to do it again.

289
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:41,569
またあったらね。
If we can.

290
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:43,069
体が勝手に...
My body's moving on its own...

291
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:45,569
あれ？あれ？
Wait? Huh?

292
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:47,569
踊り始めちゃう。あれ？あれ？
I'm starting to dance. Wait? Huh?

293
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:50,069
(笑い声)
(Laughter)

294
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:53,069
何かしらで、また3人でね、楽曲がまた出せたら...
Hopefully we can release another song together again...

295
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:54,569
いいですね。
That would be nice.

296
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:57,069
いいですね。
That would be nice.

297
00:20:57,069 --> 00:21:00,069
まぁ、乞うご期待ということで。
Well, please look forward to it.

298
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:01,269
ということで。
And with that...

299
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:03,569
皆さん、お楽しみくださいませ。
Everyone, please enjoy.

300
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:05,569
お楽しみくださいませ。
Please enjoy.

301

お楽しみにだの！
Look forward to it!

302
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:09,069
お楽しみにしてください。
Please look forward to it.

303
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,069
日本語難しい！
Japanese is hard!

304
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,069
難しいね。
It's hard.

305
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:15,569
さぁ、我々と、あやめ殿とね。
Now, we and Ayame-dono...

306
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:17,569
おん。
Yeah.

307
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:20,069
フブちゃんも、おん。この後も見届けようじゃないか。
Fubuchan too, yeah. Let's watch this through to the end.

308
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:21,869
じゃあ、ちょっとステージのね...
Well, we'll go over to...

309
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:23,569
その辺にちょっと...
Somewhere around there...

310
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:25,569
サイリウムを持って行きたいと思います！
And bring our penlights!

311
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:27,269
ありがとうございます！
Thank you very much!

312
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:30,069
頑張ってね！バイバイ！
Good luck! Bye-bye!

313
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:32,069
バイバイ！頑張ります！
Bye-bye! I'll do my best!

314
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,749
仮面越し 今日も見えている
I can see even through the mask today

315
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:58,279
いつもと変わりない笑顔
The same smile as always

316
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:02,469
纏う それは仮面か
Is that which you wear a mask?

317
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:06,719
本当の自分を教えて
Tell me your true self

318
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:10,289
着飾り澄ました顔じゃなく
Not your dressed-up, composed face

319
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:14,469
呆れるほど 臆病な
So cowardly it's appalling

320
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:16,879
偽りは it's all nothing
Falsehoods, it's all nothing

321
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:18,319
it's all nothing

322
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:20,569
真実は open my heart
The truth, open my heart

323
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:21,569
open my heart

324
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:27,269
君に 全てを 受け止めてほしい
I want you to accept everything

325
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:30,289
加速していく世界で
In this accelerating world

326
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:33,219
生きていく僕ら
Living on, we

327
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:39,069
聞き飽きたよ 比べたがりの声
I'm tired of hearing voices that want to compare

328
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:42,169
1か0かで
By 1 or 0

329
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:45,269
決められた
Decided

330
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:46,569
運命ならば
If it is fate

331
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:49,069
抗うよ 見つけるよ
I will resist, I will find

332
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:51,869
僕である理由
The reason for being me

333
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:54,869
カワイイだけじゃもういられない
I can't just be "cute" anymore

334
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:57,269
声をあげていくんだ
I'm going to raise my voice

335
00:22:57,269 --> 00:23:00,069
スターダストソング
Stardust Song

336
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:03,569
憧れの自分へ 目一杯
To my idealized self, with all my might

337
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:06,269
足元見るだけで 精一杯
Just looking at my feet is all I can do

338
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:09,269
案じているような僕には
To me who seems to be worrying

339
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:12,569
君に触れることはできるのか
Can I even reach you?

340
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:14,569
Please me answer
Please answer me

341
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:18,069
鑑定不能な myself
Inestimable myself

342
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:25,069
君と 灯す 心のまま
Just as my heart glows with you

343
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:26,569
飛び出せ！
Leap out!

344
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:30,069
加速していく世界で
In this accelerating world

345
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:32,869
生きていく僕ら
Living on, we

346
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:38,869
未知の方へ 歩むことはやめない
We won't stop walking toward the unknown

347
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:41,869
1か8かの
An all or nothing

348
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:45,569
賭けだとしても構わない
Gamble, I don't care if it is

349
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:48,869
立ち向かい 戦うよ
I will stand up and fight

350
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:51,569
頂点を目指す
Aiming for the top

351
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:55,069
そのために
For that purpose

352
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:03,569
それは 全力のなかに
That is within one's best effort

353
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:18,069
声は 力に 変わる
Voices turn into power

354
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:25,069
Up for star もう迷うことはない
Up for star, there's no more hesitation

355
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:27,269
僕だけの
Only mine

356
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:29,069
道しるべ
Signpost

357
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:32,569
胸に刻んで
Carved into my chest

358
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:35,569
加速していく世界で
In this accelerating world

359
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:38,569
生きていく僕ら

僕である理由
The reason for being me

365
00:24:56,569 --> 00:25:00,069
いつまでも 僕らしくありたい
I want to be myself forever

366
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,081
今も輝くんだスターダストソング
Even now, it shines, Stardust Song

367
00:25:03,481 --> 00:25:06,281
カワイイだけじゃもういられない
I can't just be cute anymore

368
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:10,081
声をあげていくんだスターダストソング
I'll raise my voice, Stardust Song

369
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:28,481
はい！はい！いかがでしたでしょうか
Yes! Yes! How was it?

370
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:31,781
なんかちょっと可愛い可愛い
It was kinda cute, cute

371
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:33,881
そんな盛り方するの？
You're hyping it up like that?

372
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:37,381
ねえ、あやめちゃんのこと好きってよ！
Hey, I'm saying I like Ayame-chan!

373
00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:41,481
あ、すみませんすみませんということで、ありがとうございます
Ah, excuse me, excuse me, so, thank you very much

今日はね、いやありがとうございました。すいちゃんとトワちゃんに来ていただけました！
Today, well, thank you so much. Suisei-chan and Towa-chan could come!

375
00:25:46,981 --> 00:25:49,681

We came! Yay!

376
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,081

Thank you! Thank you very much!

378
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:58,581
今日はですね、あの最近ヨガずっと
Today, well, recently I've been doing yoga...

379
00:25:58,781 --> 00:26:03,881
トワちゃんとすいちゃんとおかゆでスターダストソング踊ってたやつをね
The one where Towa-chan, Suisei-chan, and Okayu were dancing to Stardust Song...

380
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:06,381
はい、はいはい
Yes, yes yes

381
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,281
一生聴いてて
I've been listening to it non-stop

382
00:26:08,381 --> 00:26:13,581
めっちゃかっこいいと思って、おかゆはちょっと別の曲で歌ってもらおうと思って
Thinking it's so cool, I thought I'd have Okayu sing a different song

383
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,081
はい
Yes

384
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:20,381
この二人とね、乗っかってスターダストソング一緒に踊りたい、歌いたいと思って
I thought I wanted to join these two and dance and sing Stardust Song together

385
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:22,081
やったー！
Yay!

386
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,281

今日来ていただきました！
They came today!

388
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:27,581
やったー！
Yay!

389
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:31,281
いやでも本当に、あやめちゃんから声かけてもらえるとは思わなくて
No, but seriously, I didn't think I'd get a call from Ayame-chan

390
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,381
思わなくて！
Didn't think so!

391
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:33,481
トワさん？
Towa-san?

392
00:26:33,581 --> 00:26:34,981
トワさん？同じこと思った
Towa-san? I thought the same thing

393
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:38,281
あやめちゃんが誘ってくれると思ってなくて
I didn't expect Ayame-chan to invite me

394
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:39,981
え、うそー！
Eh, no way!

395
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:43,681
今日はね、心臓バクバクだったの。だって初めてじゃん
Today, my heart was pounding. Because it's the first time, right?

396
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:44,381
あ、そうそう
Ah, right, right

397
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:46,481
すいちゃんとはマジで初めて、こう3Dライブでね
With Suisei-chan, it's really the first time in a 3D live like this

398
00:26:46,581 --> 00:26:47,881
そうそうそう
Right, right, right

399
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,881
一緒にこう3人でやるみたいな
Doing it together as three like this

400
00:26:50,081 --> 00:26:51,581
そうそうないない
Yeah, there hasn't been

401
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:54,081
トワちゃんは、あの、何だっけ、丸山？
Towa-chan, well, what was it, Maruyama?

402
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:55,381
丸山、うん
Maruyama, yeah

403
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:58,781
あったけど、でもこうやって歌うのは初めてじゃない？
We had that, but it's the first time singing like this, right?

404
00:26:58,881 --> 00:27:03,081
ねえ、めっちゃ緊張したの。誘って大丈夫？って
Hey, I was so nervous. Like, 'is it okay to invite them?'

405
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:06,081
ありがとう、あやめちゃんみたいなレアキャラに
Thank you, to a rare character like Ayame-chan

406
00:27:06,281 --> 00:27:07,881
ねえ、レアキャラにね
Yeah, a rare character

407
00:27:08,081 --> 00:27:11,081
やめてよ！えー、いいじゃん可愛い
Stop it! Eh, it's fine, you're cute

408
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:14,381
どうしたの
What's wrong?

409
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:16,481
うわー
Uwaa

410
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:19,481
うわーって何
What do you mean 'Uwaa'?

411
00:27:19,581 --> 00:27:25,881
え、違うの。もうなんか、本当は断られるかもってちょっとめちゃ胃がキリキリしながら言ったの
Eh, no. I was like, actually, they might refuse, so my stomach was churning while I said it

412
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:27,481
いやいやいや
No, no, no

413
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:28,981
ちょっと悩んだけどね
I hesitated a bit, though

414
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,481
悩んだ？
You hesitated?

415
00:27:30,681 --> 00:27:33,081
いやー！って言ったでしょ
I said 'No way!', didn't I?

416
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:37,381
いやいやいや、もう普通に、でもめっちゃ早くなかった？返事
No, no, it was normal, but wasn't the reply super fast?

417
00:27:37,581 --> 00:27:38,281
乗る！って
I'm in!

418
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:40,481
二人ともね、めっちゃ早かったの
Both of them were super fast

419
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:41,381
ほら！
See!

420
00:27:41,481 --> 00:27:45,081
トワちゃん何か2日3日ぐらい寝かされるかなと思ったんだけど
I thought Towa-chan might let it sit for 2 or 3 days

421
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:49,881
いやもう即答だった、朝起きて、お、あやめちゃんから来てると思って
No, it was an instant reply, I woke up in the morning and saw 'Oh, it's from Ayame-chan'

422
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:53,081
そうそう、即答で「いいよ」って言ってくれて
Right, right, she replied instantly saying 'Okay'

423
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:54,681
感動したの
I was moved

424
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,581
ほらやりたがってるでしょ
See, they wanted to do it

425
00:27:56,681 --> 00:27:58,881
冗談冗談
Just kidding, just kidding

426
00:27:59,081 --> 00:28:03,081
ということでですね、本日はありがとうございました
So, thank you very much for today

427
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,881
あ、こちらこそありがとうございました
Ah, thank you as well

428
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:07,881
お時間みたいなんで
Looks like our time is up

429
00:28:08,081 --> 00:28:09,981
はい、すいちゃんこの辺で帰るか
Yes, Suisei-chan, shall we head out?

430
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:11,481
はい、失礼いたします
Yes, excuse us

431
00:28:11,681 --> 00:28:15,081
じゃあね、さよなら、バイバイ、頑張って！
See ya, goodbye, bye-bye, good luck!

432
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:17,381
こんな終わり方すんの？頑張れ！
It ends like this? Good luck!

433
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:20,581
いやめっちゃ雑なんだけど。大丈夫かな
Wow, that was so blunt. I wonder if it's okay

434
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:33,581
夢見る空へ
作詞：永塚健登 作曲：永塚健登
To the Dreaming Sky
Lyrics: Kento Nagatsuka, Composition: Kento Nagatsuka

435
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:38,281
重ねた手はギュッと離さずに
Holding our joined hands tightly without letting go

436
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:41,281
行くよ 行こう 夢見る空へ
Let's go, let's go, to the dreaming sky

437
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:55,681
窓越しに見上げた
Looking up through the window

438
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:58,281
とても小さな空
At a very small sky

439
00:28:58,581 --> 00:29:01,381
ここで出会えたのは
That we met here

440
00:29:01,581 --> 00:29:03,981
数え切れない奇跡
Is a countless miracle

441
00:29:04,181 --> 00:29:06,581
繰り返した一歩が
Each repeated step

442
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:09,381
煌めきを繋いで
Connects the sparkles

443
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:13,681
星のような笑顔 導いた
A smile like a star guided us

444
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:16,281
Day by Day

445
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:19,081
みんなの声が力になる
Everyone's voice becomes our strength

446
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:21,281
Stage by Stage

447
00:29:21,481 --> 00:29:24,481
ここでそれぞれ目指すもの
What each of us aims for here

448
00:29:24,881 --> 00:29:27,281
それぞれ描くもの
What each of us draws

449
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:31,081
それぞれ願った夢へ
To the dreams we each wished for

450
00:29:35,381 --> 00:29:39,581
重ねた手はギュッと離さずに
Holding our joined hands tightly without letting go

451
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:43,281
ひとりひとり違う色で
Each one with a different color

452
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,881
咲き誇るトキメキ
A throb of excitement in full bloom

453
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:50,581
振り向くことなくまっすぐに
Straight ahead without looking back

454
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:53,481
行くよ 行こう 夢見る空へ
Let's go, let's go, to the dreaming sky

455
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:04,593
夢見る空へ
To the Dreaming Sky

456
00:30:04,793 --> 00:30:07,493
笑い合ったことや
The things we laughed about

457
00:30:07,493 --> 00:30:10,193
尽きそうにない話題
and the topics that never seemed to end,

458
00:30:10,193 --> 00:30:13,093
思い出いっぱいなのに
even though they're full of memories,

459
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:15,593
あっという間の日々
the days went by in a flash.

460
00:30:15,593 --> 00:30:18,593
上書きじゃなくて
Not overwriting them,

461
00:30:18,593 --> 00:30:21,093
名前付けて保存
but saving them with names.

462
00:30:21,093 --> 00:30:25,593
どれも全部大切に生きてゆける
I can live while cherishing every single one of them.

463
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:28,093
One for All

464
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:31,093
みんなのための力になる
Becoming a strength for everyone.

465
00:30:31,293 --> 00:30:33,593
All for One

466
00:30:33,593 --> 00:30:36,593
今日も賑やかすぎるくらい
It's almost too lively again today.

467
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:39,093
笑顔が止まらない
The smiles just won't stop.

468
00:30:39,093 --> 00:30:43,093
思いは膨らんでゆく
The feelings keep growing.

469
00:30:44,293 --> 00:30:47,393
重ねた今 ギュッと噛み締めた
I savored this moment we've layered together.

470
00:30:49,893 --> 00:30:52,593
ひとりひとり違う声で
Each and every person with a different voice,

471
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:55,293
歌声が広がる
The singing voices spread out.

472
00:30:55,293 --> 00:31:00,893
風を感じたら まっすぐに行くよ
Once I feel the breeze, I'll go straight ahead.

473
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:03,593
行こう 夢見る空へ
Let's go towards the dreaming sky.

474
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:08,593
憧れて 手を伸ばし
Yearning for it, reaching out my hand,

475
00:31:08,593 --> 00:31:13,893
掴みとった その光が
that light I finally grasped...

476
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:17,093
いつの日か また誰かの
will one day, for someone else again,

477
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:21,293
憧れに変わる
turn into a yearning.

478
00:31:21,293 --> 00:31:24,593
繋げよう
Let's pass it on.

479
00:31:48,893 --> 00:31:53,893
重ねた手は ギュッと離さずに
Holding our joined hands tightly, without letting go,

480
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:59,093
ひとりひとり違う色で 描き出すトキメキ
Each and every person with a different color, painting this excitement.

481
00:31:59,593 --> 00:32:04,293
出会えた全てに ありがとう
Thank you for everything I've encountered.

482
00:32:04,293 --> 00:32:09,593
奇跡だって 起こし続け ずっと ずっと そばにいるよ
I'll keep making miracles happen, and stay by your side forever and ever.

483
00:32:09,893 --> 00:32:14,593
行こう 夢見る空へ
Let's go towards the dreaming sky.

484
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:30,593
あやめ先輩！
Ayame-senpai!

485
00:32:30,593 --> 00:32:34,593
お誕生日おめでとうございます！
Happy Birthday to you!

486
00:32:34,593 --> 00:32:37,593
ありがとうございまーす！
Thank you very much!

487
00:32:38,293 --> 00:32:40,593
あやめ先輩 何歳になったんですか？
Ayame-senpai, how old are you now?

488
00:32:40,593 --> 00:32:45,093
余は、えーっと、1500...4、5歳ぐらいになりました！
I've turned, uh, around 1500... 4 or 5 years old!

489
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:46,593
おばあ...
Grandma...

490
00:32:46,593 --> 00:32:49,093
ギスギスしないの！
Don't be mean!

491
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,093
いやでもダンス頑張ったね。
But you really worked hard on the dance.

492
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:55,593
ねえ。みんなで揃えてね。こうやって「夢見る空へ」って。
Right. We all aligned, didn't we? Doing "Yumemiru Sora e" like this.

493
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:59,093
なんかこれ、あれなんだよね。マリンと余はBloomで。
This was, you know... Marine and I were in Bloom.

494
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:01,293
そうそう。Bloom。踊ってました、見てました。
Right, right. Bloom. We danced it, we saw it.

495
00:33:01,293 --> 00:33:04,593
団長だけやったことなくて、ちょっと、んー、心配だったんだけど。
Only Danchou hadn't done it before, so I was a bit... hmmm, worried.

496
00:33:04,593 --> 00:33:08,593
なんと！今回この二人が先生になってくれて、教えてくれたんですよ。
But wait! These two became my teachers this time and taught me.

497
00:33:09,593 --> 00:33:12,093
はい、うぃんうぃんいきますよ！
Yes, win-win, here we go!

498
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:15,593
はい！高速ステップいきますよ！
Yes! Fast steps, here we go!

499
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:18,593
ちなみにここ3回ぐらい間違えました。
By the way, I messed up here about 3 times.

500
00:33:18,593 --> 00:33:22,593
間違えましたね。でも何度も撮り直しましたけど。無事に形になりました！
You did. But we re-shot it many times. And it safely took shape!

501
00:33:25,593 --> 00:33:30,093
よかったし、あとここがピタッと。きれいだったよね、最後。
It was good, and also this part was perfectly in sync. It was beautiful, right? The end.

502
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:33,593
ねえ。どうでしたか皆さん？
Yeah. How was it, everyone?

503
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:39,593
いっぱいスクショして、ハッシュタグで呟くんだぞ、お前ら！
Take lots of screenshots and tweet them with the hashtag, you lot!

504
00:33:40,593 --> 00:33:43,093
いやー。そう、あやめ先輩誕生日ということで。
Wow. So, since it's Ayame-senpai's birthday...

505
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:47,593
ちょっと誕生日プレゼントじゃないんですけど。
It's not exactly a birthday present, but...

506
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:54,093
団長やっぱあやめ先輩、今回こうダンスとか教えてくれたりとか、あとお呼ばれしてくださったんで。
Since Ayame-senpai taught me the dance and invited me here...

507
00:33:54,093 --> 00:33:58,593
え、ちなみに、あやめ先輩、サンタさんは信じてますか？
By the way, Ayame-senpai, do you believe in Santa Claus?

508
00:33:58,593 --> 00:34:01,093
そりゃサンタさんいるよ！
Of course there's a Santa Claus!

509
00:34:01,093 --> 00:34:03,593
そうですよね。団長、あやめ先輩のために。
I thought so. Danchou has, for Ayame-senpai...

510
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:08,093
なんと、サンタさんを呼んできました！
Guess what, I've brought Santa Claus!

511
00:34:10,093 --> 00:34:12,593
ホッホッホ。メリークリスマス！
Ho ho ho. Merry Christmas!

512
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:17,593
あやめちゃん、メリークリスマス。サンタさんじゃよ。ホッホッホ。
Ayame-chan, Merry Christmas. It's Santa Claus. Ho ho ho.

513
00:34:17,593 --> 00:34:20,093
誰だ？
Who's that?

514
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:22,593
サンタさん、サンタさんです。
It's Santa, Santa Claus.

515
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:26,593
あやめちゃん、サンタじゃよ。よしよし、いい子いい子。
Ayame-chan, it's Santa. There, there, good girl, good girl.

516
00:34:26,593 --> 00:34:30,093
怖い、怖い、やだー！
Scary, scary, nooo!

517
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:44,093
We wish you a Merry Christmas... (Singing)

518
00:34:58,593 --> 00:35:00,059
adrenaline!!!

519
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:10,805
単純な言葉 重ねてゆく
Simple words keep piling up

520
00:35:10,805 --> 00:35:14,305
もっと心は素直で
Let my heart be more honest

521
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:18,505
なんでもないようなその笑顔が
That casual smile of yours

522
00:35:18,505 --> 00:35:21,605
明日を照らす光に
Will be the light that shines on tomorrow

523
00:35:22,405 --> 00:35:25,605
ずっと気付いていたんだって
I've always known that

524
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:29,005
この手に抱えていたんだって
I was holding it in these hands

525
00:35:29,705 --> 00:35:33,305
弾けた声に 流した答えが
In the popping voice, the answer I let out

526
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:37,605
今 そっと きっと 願い込めた
Now, softly, surely, I've put my wish into it

527
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:43,205
ずっとまわる まわる 夢の中で
Always turning, turning in a dream

528
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:46,405
繰り返し君と踊った
I danced with you over and over

529
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:50,205
揺れる景色 道は続く
The swaying scenery, the road continues

530
00:35:50,205 --> 00:35:54,505
通り過ぎる風に吹かれ
Blown by the passing wind

531
00:35:54,505 --> 00:35:57,705
何度も越えて行けるから 境界線
I can cross it over and over, the boundary line

532
00:35:57,705 --> 00:36:00,705
雲かき分けて手を伸ばした
I pushed through the clouds and reached out my hand

533
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:04,305
涙は今浮かぶ空に
Tears are now in the floating sky

534
00:36:04,305 --> 00:36:07,905
預けて走り出すの
I'll leave them behind and start running

535
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:12,205
並んで見つけた
We found it standing side by side

536
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:16,205
輝く光を手に
The shining light in our hands

537
00:36:26,805 --> 00:36:30,305
問題はいつも自分次第
Problems are always up to yourself

538
00:36:30,305 --> 00:36:33,505
さあ未来を選んで
Come on, choose your future

539
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:37,505
こんがらがっていた紐解いた
I unraveled what was tangled

540
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:40,805
思いのまま進もう
Let's move forward as we wish

541
00:36:41,505 --> 00:36:44,805
毎日冒険なんだって
Every day is an adventure

542
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:47,905
奇跡は無限大なんだって
Miracles are infinite

543
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:52,305
高鳴る思い 羅針盤のように
My throbbing feelings are like a compass

544
00:36:52,305 --> 00:36:56,605
今 そっと きっと 導いてく
Now, softly, surely, they'll guide me

545
00:36:58,405 --> 00:37:01,905
そうだ巡る 巡る 波に乗っかって
That's right, going around, riding the waves

546
00:37:01,905 --> 00:37:05,005
風まかせ君と笑った
Laughing with you, letting the wind take us

547
00:37:05,205 --> 00:37:08,905
予想外は 想定内
The unexpected is within expectations

548
00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:12,805
間違いや失敗も楽しんで
Enjoy the mistakes and failures too

549
00:37:13,305 --> 00:37:16,705
一歩踏み出したら見えた可能性
Possibilities appeared when I took a step forward

550
00:37:16,705 --> 00:37:19,905
行き止まりの壁壊して
Break down the walls of dead ends

551
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:23,305
まだ知らない 世界君と
An unknown world, with you

552
00:37:23,305 --> 00:37:26,605
一緒なら怖くないよ
I won't be afraid if we're together

553
00:37:27,505 --> 00:37:30,905
わくわくしている
I'm so excited

554
00:37:30,905 --> 00:37:35,105
今が一番大好き
I love the present most of all

555
00:38:01,605 --> 00:38:05,005
ゆっくり ゆっくり 焦らず 焦らず
Slowly, slowly, don't rush, don't rush

556
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:08,605
自分の 自分の 歩幅で行こう
Let's go at our own pace

557
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:12,805
大丈夫 大丈夫 心配ない 心配ない
It's okay, it's okay, no worries, no worries

558
00:38:12,805 --> 00:38:17,405
描いたもの 全部叶えるよ
I'll make everything I pictured come true

559
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:23,005
ずっとまわる まわる 夢の中で
Always turning, turning in a dream

560
00:38:23,005 --> 00:38:26,205
繰り返し君と踊った
I danced with you over and over

561
00:38:26,205 --> 00:38:29,705
いつか君と 約束した
That promise I made with you one day

562
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:33,505
願いの架け橋を渡って
I'll cross the bridge of wishes

563
00:38:34,005 --> 00:38:37,405
何度も越えて行けるから 境界線
I can cross it over and over, the boundary line

564

雲かき分けて手を伸ばした

567
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:51,905
並んで見つけた
We found it standing side by side

568
00:38:51,905 --> 00:38:55,405

The shining light in our hands

569

あやめちゃん！
Ayame-chan!

572
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:29,205
あやめちゃん！
Ayame-chan!

573
00:39:29,205 --> 00:39:30,605
お誕生日おめでとう！
Happy birthday!

574
00:39:29,205 --> 00:39:30,605
お誕生日おめでとう！
Happy birthday!

575
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:33,305
ありがとうございます！
Thank you so much!

576
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,605
ねぇ前回もね、来てくれたのに
You know, even though you came last time,

577
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:39,205
今回も来てくれてありがとうございます。
thank you for coming this time as well.

578
00:39:39,505 --> 00:39:41,205
はーい、呼んでくれてめっちゃ嬉しいよ。
Of course! I'm so happy you invited me.

579
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:42,605
ありがとう。
Thank you.

580
00:39:43,105 --> 00:39:45,405
なんかね、前回はさ、なんかこう
Well, last time,

581
00:39:45,405 --> 00:39:47,905
余がおかゆんと、で、余がころねんと、って
I danced with Okayu-n, and then with Korone-n,

582
00:39:47,905 --> 00:39:50,205
それぞれで踊ったんだけど、
separately, but...

583
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:53,705
今回はおかころの二人と一緒に
this time I wanted to sing and dance together

584
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:55,805
歌って踊りたかったんよね。
with the OkaKoro duo.

585
00:39:56,205 --> 00:39:57,205
ほうほうほう。
I see, I see.

586
00:39:57,305 --> 00:39:59,005
で、何歌おうかなって考えた時に...
So, when I was thinking about what to sing...

587
00:40:00,437 --> 00:40:02,967
おかころに歌ってほしい曲をね、あの、ベースに考えていたんですけど。
I was thinking of a song I wanted OkaKoro to sing as the base.

588
00:40:03,017 --> 00:40:04,217
あ、そうなの？
Oh, really?

589
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:05,217
そうなの？
Is that so?

590
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:08,617
アドレナリンを聴いた時に、この二人のてぇてぇ感じに歌ってほしいと思ってね。
When I heard 'Adrenaline!!!', I thought I wanted you two to sing it in a wholesome way.

591
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:11,317
で、そこに、あわよくば余もちょっと添えられたらな、みたいな。
And I thought, if possible, I could be added to that too.

592
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,867
いやいや、主役だから！
No, no, you're the star!

593
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:13,917
そうだよ。
That's right.

594
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:16,567
あくまでお二人を基準に選んだ曲なんですけれども。
It's a song I chose based strictly on you two.

595
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:18,217
えー、そうなのー。
Eh, is that so?

596
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:21,017
うれしいねぇ。一生懸命みんなわちゃわちゃ踊ってくれた。
That's happy. Everyone worked hard dancing together.

597
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:23,467
いやいや、とんでもない。
No, not at all.

598
00:40:23,517 --> 00:40:25,817
えー、すごい。でもこの三人よかったよね。
Wow, great. But this trio was good, wasn't it?

599
00:40:25,867 --> 00:40:28,567
ねー。なんだかんだ、初めてじゃない？
Yeah. Come to think of it, isn't this the first time?

600
00:40:28,617 --> 00:40:30,617
初めて。そう、めちゃレアなんだよ。
The first time. Yes, it's very rare.

601
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,517
レアなんだよね。
It's rare.

602
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:33,817
レア。めちゃてぇてぇだった。
Rare. It was so wholesome.

603
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:35,167
てぇてぇだった。
It was wholesome.

604
00:40:35,217 --> 00:40:36,617
てぇてぇてぇだったよね。
It was triple wholesome.

605
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:37,917
てぇてぇてぇ。
Triple wholesome.

606
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:39,217
三人だから。
Because there's three of us.

607
00:40:39,267 --> 00:40:40,517
あ、てぇてぇてぇね。
Ah, triple wholesome.

608
00:40:40,567 --> 00:40:42,317
てぇてぇてぇだったね。
It was triple wholesome.

609
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:44,317
てぇてぇてぇだった。
It was triple wholesome.

610
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:47,567
まあそうだね、もう今夜限りでしょうね、この組み合わせも。
Well, that's right. This combination might be for tonight only.

611
00:40:47,617 --> 00:40:49,217
今夜限りなの？
Tonight only?

612
00:40:49,267 --> 00:40:51,667
え、今日で終わりですか？
Eh, is it over today?

613
00:40:51,717 --> 00:40:54,017
まあ、今日限りでしょ。レアだから。
Well, it's today only. Because it's rare.

614
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:55,817
なるほどね。
I see.

615
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:58,817
今夜限りだからこその良さがあるってことか。
So there's a merit specifically because it's for tonight only.

616
00:40:58,867 --> 00:41:00,367
そうなの、そうなの。
That's right, that's right.

617
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,217
これからは、ない…
So from now on, there won't...

618
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:03,117
ない？
Be any more?

619
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:05,217
ないってことだね。
Be any more, right?

620
00:41:05,267 --> 00:41:06,717
あらー…。
Oh dear...

621
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:11,967
（泣き声）
(Crying sounds)

622
00:41:12,017 --> 00:41:13,317
あやめ様、大丈夫？
Lady Ayame, are you okay?

623
00:41:13,367 --> 00:41:14,617
大丈夫？
Are you okay?

624
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:16,217
どうしよう。
What should I do?

625
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:19,217
（泣き声）
(Crying sounds)

626
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:21,117
まあ、そうだね、そっとしておいてあげようね。
Well, let's just leave her alone for now.

627
00:41:31,117 --> 00:41:34,117
clever

Lyrics: Sho Watanabe, Composition: Sho Watanabe

629
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:46,417
あぁ　流れ着いてついたって　何も
Ah, even if I drifted and arrived here, I feel nothing

630
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:51,917
感じない　せめて誰かここに　綴って
At least let someone write something here

631
00:41:52,517 --> 00:41:56,917
ねぇ　決められたコースに　ハマって
Hey, getting stuck in a predetermined course

632
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:59,717
しかたない
I can't help it

633
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:03,517
今の意味を見ずに行くの
Going on without looking at the meaning of now

634
00:42:03,517 --> 00:42:07,517
退屈な色を　溶かして　ちょっとでも
Dissolve the boring colors, even if just a little

635
00:42:08,117 --> 00:42:12,017
和えろ　建前を　作って　守って
Mix them together, creating and protecting the facade

636
00:42:12,417 --> 00:42:16,517
このゲームみたいな箱の中
Inside this box that's like a game

637
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:21,317
泳いで　足掻いて　居場所探した
Swimming, struggling, searching for a place to belong

638
00:42:22,617 --> 00:42:27,517
ほら　混ざり合い不揃いな　葛藤の中　歌って
Look, singing amidst the messy, mismatched conflicts

639
00:42:28,017 --> 00:42:33,517
真実も現実も　重ねて　見失ってた
Truth and reality overlapped, and I lost sight of them

640
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:38,917
まなざしが胸に起き　唯一残った条件持って
A gaze awakens in my heart, holding the only remaining condition

641
00:42:38,917 --> 00:42:43,417
世界に寄り添っていこう
Let's get close to the world

642
00:42:43,817 --> 00:42:46,617
世界は一つでもないし
The world is not just one

643
00:42:58,717 --> 00:43:03,017
あぁ　常識に飲まれた　出口と
Ah, the exit swallowed by common sense and

644
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:08,917
勘違い　それも別に悪くないから
the misunderstanding, that's not too bad either

645
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:13,317
ねぇ　溶けきれない本音は　溜まって
Hey, the feelings that won't fully melt accumulate

646
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:16,517
欲しくて
and I want them

647
00:43:16,917 --> 00:43:20,317
消える前に現れるの
They appear before they vanish

648
00:43:20,317 --> 00:43:24,417
単調な日々の予定　吐き捨て　呆気なく
Spitting out the plans of monotonous days, so suddenly

649
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:28,917
台無しに崩れだす
It starts to crumble into a mess

650
00:43:29,317 --> 00:43:33,417
ゆっくり　止まった　先に映り合うほど
Slowly, as if reflecting each other at the end of the halt

651
00:43:33,817 --> 00:43:38,217
綺麗に　光りそうな　期待があった
There was an expectation that would shine beautifully

652
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:44,317
ただ　終わらない夢の中　笑ってなんていられない
In a dream that just won't end, I can't just keep smiling

653
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:50,417
目を開け　突き確かめていた　痛いって歌う
Open your eyes, I was confirming it, singing that it hurts

654
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:55,817
今　人から借りてきた　言葉あてに進まないで
Now, don't move forward relying on words borrowed from others

655
00:43:55,817 --> 00:44:00,217
胸響かせないで
Don't let them resonate in your heart

656
00:44:00,217 --> 00:44:03,117
結局は自分次第に
In the end, it's up to you

657
00:45:00,129 --> 00:45:02,229
...寄り添って行こう
...let's go side by side.

658
00:45:03,429 --> 00:45:06,129
世界は一つでもないし
The world isn't just one thing,

659
00:45:06,129 --> 00:45:08,929
結局は自分次第に
and in the end, it's all up to you.

660
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:57,129
はい！
Yes!

661
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,629
おお～
Whoa~

662
00:45:58,629 --> 00:46:01,629
ということで、あやあや、楽しかったね、あやあや！
So, Aya-aya, that was fun, Aya-aya!

663
00:46:02,129 --> 00:46:03,629
そうそう、そうだね。
Yes, yes, it was.

664
00:46:03,629 --> 00:46:05,629
最高だったね、あやあや！
It was the best, Aya-aya!

665
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,629
そう、ヤバい、私たち...
Yeah, it's crazy how we...

666
00:46:07,629 --> 00:46:10,129
息ぴったりだったじゃん！
...were perfectly in sync!

667
00:46:10,129 --> 00:46:13,629
そうだよね！もう、こんなのやっちゃってね、こんな。
Right! I mean, we were doing all this, like this.

668
00:46:13,629 --> 00:46:17,629
あやあや、ヤバい。あははは。
Aya-aya, this is crazy. Ahahaha.

669
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:21,629
ということで、今日はかなたちゃんに...
So, today, for Kanata-chan...

670
00:46:21,629 --> 00:46:25,629
あ、あ、すいません。すいません。
Oh, oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

671
00:46:25,629 --> 00:46:28,629
今日、かなたちゃんに来ていただきました！ありがとうございます！
We have Kanata-chan here today! Thank you so much!

672
00:46:28,629 --> 00:46:32,129
ありがとうございます！天音かなたです。
Thank you! I'm Amane Kanata.

673
00:46:32,129 --> 00:46:34,129
よろしくお願いします。
Nice to meet you.

674
00:46:34,129 --> 00:46:36,129
よろしくお願いします。歌い終わったんですけど。
Nice to meet you. We just finished singing.

675
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:37,129
終わりましたね。
We did.

676
00:46:37,129 --> 00:46:40,629
今日ね、あの、歌ってもらった「clever」って曲なんですけど。
So about the song we sang today, 'clever'...

677
00:46:40,629 --> 00:46:43,129
はい、余が大好きなClariSさんの曲なんですけど。
Yes, it's a song by ClariS, whom I love.

678
00:46:43,129 --> 00:46:45,129
おお、すごい素敵なんだよね。
Oh, it's a really wonderful song.

679
00:46:45,129 --> 00:46:47,629
でも、かなたもさ、ClariS好きじゃん、たぶん。
But you like ClariS too, don't you, Kanata?

680
00:46:47,629 --> 00:46:48,629
好き好き！
I love them!

681
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:51,629
好きなんだろうなっていうのを思ってて。
I figured you would.

682
00:46:51,629 --> 00:46:52,629
なんか、そう、伝わってると。
I guess it showed.

683
00:46:52,629 --> 00:46:55,629
そう、思ってて。で、しかも「clever」って曲、ちょっとかっこいいじゃん。
Yeah, I thought so. And 'clever' is a pretty cool song.

684
00:46:55,629 --> 00:46:56,629
そう。
True.

685
00:46:56,629 --> 00:47:00,129
で、なんかよくかっこいい歌を一緒にかなたちゃんと歌いたいなって思ってて。
And I've always wanted to sing a cool song with you, Kanata.

686
00:47:00,129 --> 00:47:03,629
で、「clever」を聴いたときに、「これかなたちゃんしかいない」と思ったの。
When I heard 'clever', I thought, 'It has to be Kanata-chan.'

687
00:47:03,629 --> 00:47:06,629
ヤバいヤバいヤバい。
Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow.

688
00:47:06,629 --> 00:47:11,629
で、かなたちゃんに一緒に歌ってくれませんかっていうのを送ったんですけど。
So I sent a message asking if you'd sing it with me.

689
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:14,629
いや、もう本当に大喜び。
I was absolutely overjoyed.

690
00:47:14,629 --> 00:47:15,629
本当に？
Really?

691
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:19,629
喜びすぎて、急に心の距離縮めちゃって、あやあや。
I was so happy, I suddenly felt much closer to you, Aya-aya.

692
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:22,629
距離縮めてもらいました。頑張って返していきたいと思います。
You definitely did. I'll try my best to match that energy.

693
00:47:23,629 --> 00:47:24,629
今日はね。
Today, though...

694
00:47:24,629 --> 00:47:25,629
今日はね。
Today, though...

695
00:47:25,629 --> 00:47:30,129
本当に嬉しい。あやめ先輩のね、歌も声も大好きっていうのは、
I'm so happy. I've always loved your singing and your voice, Ayame-senpai.

696
00:47:30,129 --> 00:47:35,129
本当にデビューする前に、ホロメンのみんなに挨拶回りに行ったときにも、余にちょっと送れたんだよね。
Even before my debut, when I was greeting all the Holo-members, I sent you a message.

697
00:47:35,129 --> 00:47:37,629
すごい持ち上げてくれてね。
You were so complimentary.

698
00:47:37,629 --> 00:47:41,629
持ち上げてない、本当、事実事実。事実を陳列罪したんですよ。
I wasn't! It was just the truth. I was guilty of presenting the facts.

699
00:47:43,129 --> 00:47:47,629
そしたらね、それからの、本当に一緒に歌えてとっても嬉しかったです。
So after all that, I was so happy to finally sing with you.

700
00:47:47,629 --> 00:47:50,129
ありがとうございました。
Thank you so much.

701
00:47:50,129 --> 00:47:53,129
ありがとうございます、こちらこそ。これからも歌ってみたとか...
Thank you, same here. Maybe we can do a 'tried singing' cover together...

702
00:47:53,129 --> 00:47:54,129
良いんですか！？
Really?!

703
00:47:54,129 --> 00:47:55,629
嬉しい。
I'm so glad.

704
00:47:55,629 --> 00:47:57,129
はい、もちろんです。
Yes, of course.

705
00:47:57,129 --> 00:47:58,629
あ、本当に今度。
Oh, definitely soon.

706
00:47:58,629 --> 00:48:02,129
なんか、イベントがちょっとあったりするのかな？みたいなの、
There might be some events coming up, maybe...

707
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:06,629
ちょっと一緒に、なんかすーるかも？みたいなのもありますんで。
...we might be doing something together? There's that possibility too.

708
00:48:07,629 --> 00:48:09,629
お楽しみにくださいませ。
Please look forward to it.

709
00:48:10,129 --> 00:48:12,629
ということで、かなたちゃんでした！
So, that was Kanata-chan!

710
00:48:12,629 --> 00:48:14,629
ありがとうございました！
Thank you so much!

711
00:48:14,629 --> 00:48:15,629
ありがとね。
Thanks for coming.

712
00:48:16,129 --> 00:48:18,129
バイバイ！
Bye-bye!

713
00:48:25,129 --> 00:48:30,129
退屈な窓辺に　吹き込む風に
On the wind blowing through the boring window,

714
00:48:30,629 --> 00:48:36,129
顔をしかめたのは　照れくささの裏返し
the reason I frowned was to hide my embarrassment.

715
00:48:47,129 --> 00:48:51,629
曖昧に頷く　手のひらの今日
Nodding vaguely at today in the palm of my hand,

716
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:57,629
描いてる自分は　少し大げさで
the self I envision is a bit exaggerated.

717
00:48:58,129 --> 00:49:02,629
何か変わりそうな　気がしているよ
I have a feeling that something is about to change.

718
00:49:03,129 --> 00:49:08,129
心に呼びかける　君のせいだね
It's because of you, calling out to my heart.

719
00:49:10,129 --> 00:49:14,629
曇り空　のぞいた光
Light peeking through the cloudy sky,

720
00:49:15,129 --> 00:49:20,629
手を伸ばそう　いつよりも力強い勇気で
I'll reach out with courage stronger than ever before.

721
00:49:23,629 --> 00:49:29,629
光も影も　まだ遠くて　それでも僕らは
Light and shadow are still far away, but still, we...

722
00:49:30,129 --> 00:49:34,129
優しさの理由が知りたい
...want to know the reason for kindness.

723
00:49:34,629 --> 00:49:39,129
今は誰の名前でもない　輝きの彼方へ
To the radiance beyond, which belongs to no one yet,

724
00:49:41,629 --> 00:49:49,129
全部過去になる前に　見つけに行こう
let's go find it before it all becomes the past.

725
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:03,541
君はまるで 頼りない夢と
You are like an unreliable dream

726
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:08,941
嘯く僕の目を からかうように
Mocking my bragging eyes

727
00:50:09,241 --> 00:50:13,741
君が見てる空は 何色だろう
What color is the sky you're looking at?

728
00:50:13,941 --> 00:50:20,441
きっと青く高く 清らかなはず
It must be blue, high, and pure

729
00:50:21,141 --> 00:50:26,641
すれ違い 近付きながら
Passing each other while getting closer

730
00:50:26,641 --> 00:50:32,541
いつの日か 戸惑いも受け止めていけたら
If one day I can accept even the confusion

731
00:50:35,041 --> 00:50:39,241
言葉のままじゃ もどかしくて
Words alone are frustrating

732
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:46,141
だから何度でも 不器用に重ねてしまうね
So I clumsily layer them over and over again

733
00:50:46,141 --> 00:50:53,041
喜びも悲しみも ここで意味が生まれること
Joy and sadness, both finding meaning here

734
00:50:53,441 --> 00:51:03,541
二人 気付き始めてる その理由を
The two of us are starting to realize the reason for it

735
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:23,241
言葉のままじゃ もどかしくて
Words alone are frustrating

736
00:51:23,741 --> 00:51:26,841
何度でも
Over and over

737
00:51:26,841 --> 00:51:30,541
不器用に重ねてしまうよ
I'll layer them clumsily

738
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:36,641
声にならない切なさごと
Along with the wordless sorrow

739
00:51:36,641 --> 00:51:42,141
この思い 君に届け
May these feelings reach you

740
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:45,841
光も影も まだ遠くて
Both light and shadow are still far away

741
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:52,541
それでも僕らは 優しさの理由が知りたい
But even so, we want to know the reason for kindness

742
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:56,941
今は誰の名前でもない
Now to the far side of the radiance

743
00:51:56,941 --> 00:52:00,141
輝きの彼方へ
That belongs to no one

744
00:52:00,141 --> 00:52:06,441
全部 過去になる前に 見つけに行こう
Let's go find it before it all becomes the past

745
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:16,941
君が 過去になる前に 見つけるから
Because I'll find you before you become the past

746
00:52:44,341 --> 00:52:50,941
はい！ということでね、たくさんあの、もうぶっ通しで歌って踊ったわけですけれども、皆さん楽しんでいただけてますでしょうかー！
Yes! So, I've been singing and dancing non-stop, but are you all enjoying yourselves?

747
00:52:50,941 --> 00:52:58,341
今回はね、前回と違って、少しだけダンスも成長したんじゃないかなーってちょっと思うんですけど、
This time, unlike last time, I think my dancing has improved a little bit.

748
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:04,741
前回もねなんか成長したなーって思ったんだけど、今回もちょっと成長したかなーっていう風に思ってるんだけど、どうですか皆さん？
I thought I'd improved last time too, but I think I've improved a bit more this time as well. What do you all think?

749
00:53:05,841 --> 00:53:13,341
うんうんうん。うんうんうん！みんな褒めてくれてる！たぶん！たぶん褒めてくれてるはずです！
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah! Everyone's praising me! Probably! I'm sure they are!

750
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:23,841
ということで、あの、なんかステージ立つんも、少し、なんか前まではね、もうなんか恥ずかしくて、もうなんかあの全然思うように動けなかったんですけど、
So, standing on stage is also... well, until before I was just embarrassed and couldn't move the way I wanted to at all.

751
00:53:23,841 --> 00:53:32,541
なんか自信がね少しだけついてきて、ダンスを踊るなんか回数も多くなってきたから、ちょっとね自信がついたんですけどれも、
But I've gained a little bit of confidence, and since I've been dancing more often, I've gained a bit of confidence.

752
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:37,541
まあねそんな成長した姿をみんなに少しでも、まあ見せられたらいいかなーって思ってます！
Well, I hope I was able to show everyone at least a little bit of my growth!

753
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:42,941

微睡みへ委ねるの
I surrender myself to a slumber

823
00:59:21,653 --> 00:59:24,653
生まれては弾け消える
Born only to burst and vanish

824
00:59:24,653 --> 00:59:27,653
うたかたの調べは
The transient melody is...

825
00:59:27,653 --> 00:59:31,153
その一瞬も大切にしよう
Let's cherish that very moment too

満たして 鮮やかに
Fill it, vividly

827
00:59:36,653 --> 00:59:40,153
そっと きんらりきんらり 夢花火
Softly, glitteringly, glitteringly, dream fireworks

828
00:59:40,153 --> 00:59:43,153
ひっそりひっそり 祈るのは
Quietly, quietly, what I pray for

829
00:59:43,153 --> 00:59:47,653

宿る火もさらば
Farewell to the dwelling fire

836
01:00:17,475 --> 01:00:21,179
この現世も彩りとなれ
Let even this world be colored

837
01:00:21,346 --> 01:00:24,949
咲かせて 鮮やかに
Let it bloom, vividly

Is only the joy of this world

01:00:43,735 --> 01:00:46,604
巡り合う情け
The kindness we find in our encounters

845
01:00:46,671 --> 01:00:52,143
忘れないように
So that I won't forget

01:00:52,744 --> 01:00:55,446
常しえに
For eternity

847
01:00:55,513 --> 01:00:58,483
