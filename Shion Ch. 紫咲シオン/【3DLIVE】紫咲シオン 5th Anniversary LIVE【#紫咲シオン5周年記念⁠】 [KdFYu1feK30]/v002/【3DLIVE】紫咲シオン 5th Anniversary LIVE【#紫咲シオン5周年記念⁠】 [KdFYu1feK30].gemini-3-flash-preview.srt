過ぎていく 日々には鈍感な
Passing through days, insensitive...

157
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,158
君へ
...to you

158
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:16,858
落ちていく
Falling away...

159
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:18,158
過去は鮮明で
...the past is vivid

160
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,458
見せたい
The future...

161
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,758
未来は繊細だ
...I want to show you is delicate

162
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:23,408
過ぎていく 日々には鈍感な
Passing through days, insensitive...

163
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:26,108
君へ
...to you

164
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:28,158
ねえ
Hey...

165
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:30,758
もっと騒げ 怪獣の歌
Make more noise, the monster's song

166
00:09:30,758 --> 00:09:33,408
まだ消えない 夢の歌唱えて
Sing the dream song that hasn't faded yet

167
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,108
君がいつも 歌う怪獣の歌
The monster's song you always sing

168
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:40,758
まだ消えない 夢の歌唱えて
Sing the dream song that hasn't faded yet

169
00:09:40,758 --> 00:09:43,358
君がいつも 歌う怪獣の歌
The monster's song you always sing

170
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:46,008
まだ消えない 夢の歌唱えて
Sing the dream song that hasn't faded yet

171
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:48,658
君がいつも 歌う怪獣の歌
The monster's song you always sing

172
00:09:48,658 --> 00:09:51,258
まだ消えない 口ずさんでしまうよ
It hasn't faded yet, I end up humming it

173
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:54,208
ねえ
Hey...

174
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,808
僕ら 眠れない夜に
...we, during sleepless nights...

175
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:58,108
手を伸ばして
...reach out our hands

176
00:09:58,108 --> 00:09:59,408
眠れない夜も
Sleepless nights, too...

177
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:00,008
また伸ばして
...reach out again

178
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:01,316
手を伸ばして
Reach out your hand

179
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:02,816
眠れない夜をまた伸ばして
Extending the sleepless night again

180
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:04,116
眠くない今だね
I'm still not sleepy

181
00:10:04,116 --> 00:10:06,516
そんな日々でいたいのにね
Even though I want to stay in those days

182
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:07,616
眠れない夜に手を伸ばして
Reach out your hand in the sleepless night

183
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:09,116
眠れない夜をまた伸ばして
Extending the sleepless night again

184
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:10,516
眠くない今だね
I'm still not sleepy

185
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:12,716
そんな夜に歌う
Singing on such a night

186
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:15,516
怪獣の歌
The monster's song

187
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:25,016
怪獣の歌
Monster's Song

188
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:29,816
過ぎていく日々はどうかな
How are the days passing by?

189
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,416
落ちていく
Falling down

190
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,916
過去は冴えないね
The past is dull

191
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,716
見せたい未来は繊細で
The future I want to show is delicate

192
00:10:37,716 --> 00:10:41,216
過ぎていく日々はどうかな
How are the days passing by?

193
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:42,516
君がね
You...

194
00:10:57,016 --> 00:11:05,016
ミカヅキ
Crescent Moon

195
00:10:57,316 --> 00:11:00,016
今宵満月ではないわ
It's not a full moon tonight

196
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:04,016
嫌いな満月がキラキラ
The hated full moon is sparkling

197
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:11,816
幸せそうに世界を照らしている
Happily lighting up the world

198
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:19,416
丁度私はできそこないでどうしようもなくて
Exactly, I'm a failure and there's nothing I can do

199
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:27,016
夜明け夢見ては地べた這いずり回ってる
Dreaming of dawn, crawling around on the ground

200
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:31,216
それでも誰かに見つけて欲しくて
Still, I want someone to find me

201
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:35,216
夜空見上げて叫んでいる
Looking up at the night sky and screaming

202
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:38,216
逃げ出したい 逃げ出せない
I want to escape, I can't escape

203
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:42,516
明るい未来は見えないね
I can't see a bright future, can I?

204
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:46,816
それでもあなたに見つけて欲しくて
Still, I want you to find me

205
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:50,116
蝶のように舞い上がるの
I'll soar like a butterfly

206
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:54,216
欠けた翼で飛んだ
I flew with broken wings

207
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:58,516
醜い星の子 ミカヅキ
The ugly star-child, Mikazuki

208
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:08,516
今宵満月ではないわ
It's not a full moon tonight

209
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:13,216
嫌いな満月がユラユラ
The hated full moon is swaying

210
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:20,616
誰かの腕に抱かれて眠っている
Sleeping in someone's arms

211
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:28,216
丁度私は一人の夜に押しつぶされては
Exactly, I'm being crushed by a lonely night

212
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:35,816
誰にも見えない夜闇這いずり回ってる
Crawling around in the darkness that no one can see

213
00:12:36,116 --> 00:12:39,916
それでも誰にも負けたくなくて
Still, I don't want to lose to anyone

214
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:43,916
宇宙の隅でもがいている
Struggling in a corner of the universe

215
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,916
追いつきたい 追い越したい
I want to catch up, I want to overtake

216
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:51,316
夢に見たいような世界ね
A world like one I'd see in a dream, right?

217
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:55,616
それとも誰かと比べてばかり
Still, always comparing myself to someone

218
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:59,716
周りを見ては立ち止まって
Looking around and stopping

219
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:03,116
欠けたものを探した
Searching for what's missing

220
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,816
そんな自分を変えたい
I want to change that self

221
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:29,316
それでもあなたと同じ景色がまた見たいから
Because I still want to see the same scenery as you again

222
00:13:29,316 --> 00:13:33,216
泣き出したくても 投げ出したくても
Even if I want to cry, even if I want to give up

223
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:36,616
諦めたりはできない
I can't give up

224
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:40,516
それでもあなたに見つかるように
Still, so that you can find me

225
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:44,516
蛹は強く手を伸ばすの
The chrysalis strongly reaches out its hand

226
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:48,516
欠けたもの抱きしめて
Embracing the missing pieces

227
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:52,516
願いを放つよ ミカヅキ
I'll release my wish, Mikazuki

228
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:58,516
それでも誰かに見つけて欲しくて
Still, I want someone to find me

229
00:13:58,516 --> 00:14:02,516
夜空見上げて叫んでいる
Looking up at the night sky and screaming

230
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:06,116
泣き出したいけど 泣き出さない
I want to cry, but I won't cry

231
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:10,116
もう後戻りなどできないね
I can't turn back anymore, can I?

232
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:14,016
それでもあなたに見つけて欲しくて
Still, I want you to find me

233
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:17,516
蝶のように舞い上がるの
I'll soar like a butterfly

234
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:21,516
欠けた翼で飛ぶよ
I'll fly with broken wings

235
00:14:21,516 --> 00:14:25,316
醜い星の子 ミカヅキ
The ugly star-child, Mikazuki

236
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:29,616
光を放った ミカヅキ
Released the light, Mikazuki

237
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:04,024
ミカヅキ
Mikazuki

238
00:15:00,585 --> 00:15:04,560
いつかは君のままだと
Sometime, as you are

239
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,134
笑っている
smiling.

240
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:27,943
はーい！

Is everyone watching? Were you watching closely?

244
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:43,055
3曲ね、連続で最初から歌っちゃいましたけど、どうでしたか？
I sang three songs in a row right from the start. How was it?

245
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:45,123
可愛かった？
Was I cute?

246
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:48,360
ま、きっと可愛かったでしょう。えへへ。
Well, I'm sure I was. Ehehe.

And there are Shiokko. Oh, they're acting as cameramen, the three up there.

There's one over here too.

257
00:16:23,162 --> 00:16:25,231
これ何持ってんだろね？
I wonder what they're holding?

258
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:27,299
うまい棒みたいなの持ってる。
They're holding something that looks like Umaibou.

259

でね、でね、見て見て。こっち！

273
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,863

I wonder who they are?

274
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,334
え、誰だろう誰だろう。え、もしかして出てくるのかな？この先。
I wonder who, I wonder who. Could it be they'll show up later on?

275
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:41,540
え、どうなんだろう。いや分かんないな、分かんないんだけど、かも知れないよね。
Well, I wonder. I don't know, I don't know, but it might be.

入籍！入籍！入籍！ノリで
Marriage registration! Marriage registration! (x7)
Just for the hell of it

623

ゼクシィ買って 式に備えよう
Let's buy Zexy and prepare for the ceremony

624
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:08,556
入籍してみたらええやん
多分2年以内に別れると
Why not just get married?
Though I think you'll probably break up within two years

625
00:37:09,056 --> 00:37:14,056
心のどこかで 思っているけど
秘密にしておくね
Somewhere in my heart, I'm thinking that
But I'll keep it a secret

626
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:19,556
金銭感覚 物の価値観 身体の相性
Financial sense, values, physical compatibility

627
00:37:19,556 --> 00:37:24,056
言えない過去や 消したい過去は
お互いにたくさんあるけれど
Unspeakable pasts or pasts we want to erase
We both have many of them, but

628
00:37:24,556 --> 00:37:29,056
モラハラ ギャンブル 年収と嫁姑問題
Moral harassment, gambling, income and in-law issues

629
00:37:29,056 --> 00:37:34,056
どうしようもない 浮気癖とか
不安はあるけれどさ
Uncontrollable cheating habits and such
There are anxieties, but

630
00:37:34,556 --> 00:37:39,056
ノリで入籍してみたらええやん
君らお似合いやん それハッピーやん

後のことは責任取らんけど
Why not just get married?
I won't take responsibility for what happens later

633
00:37:50,556 --> 00:37:55,556
きっと上手くいくよ
何となくそんな 気がしてるんだ
It'll surely work out
I just have a feeling that it will

634
00:37:56,056 --> 00:38:00,556
入籍してみた ええやん
きっと2年以内に別れるけど
We tried getting married. It's fine
Though we'll surely break up within two years

635
00:38:01,056 --> 00:38:05,556
イェーイ！
Yeah!

636
00:38:06,056 --> 00:38:14,056

Congratulations! Congratulations!
Congratulations on your marriage!

638
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:42,056
Happy Wedding!

639
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:13,556
君が持ってきた漫画くれた 知らない名前の花
The manga you brought gave me
a flower with a name I didn't know

640
00:39:13,556 --> 00:39:18,556
今日はまだ来ないかな 初めての感情 知ってしまった
I wonder if they're coming today
I've learned a new feeling

641
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:24,556
窓辺飾った絵画 なぞる一人で宇宙を旅して
A painting decorating the windowsill
Tracing it, traveling the universe alone

642
00:39:25,056 --> 00:39:30,056
それだけでいいはずだったのに
That should have been enough, and yet

643
00:39:31,556 --> 00:39:36,556
君の手を握ってしまったら
If I end up holding your hand

644
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:42,556
孤独を知らないこの街には
In this city that doesn't know loneliness

645
00:39:43,556 --> 00:39:48,556
もう二度と帰ってくることは
I probably won't be able to

646
00:39:48,556 --> 00:39:53,056
できないのでしょう
Return ever again

647
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:59,056
君が手を差し伸べた
You reached out your hand

648
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:05,164
光で影が生まれる
Light gives birth to shadows

649
00:40:05,564 --> 00:40:08,564
歌って聴かせて
Sing and let me hear

650
00:40:08,564 --> 00:40:11,664
この話の続き
the continuation of this story

651
00:40:11,764 --> 00:40:14,364
連れて行って
Take me away

652
00:40:14,364 --> 00:40:19,064
見たことない星まで
to a star I've never seen

653
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:30,864
誰の手も声も届かない
No one's hand or voice can reach

654
00:40:30,864 --> 00:40:34,364
高くそびえ立った塔の上
Atop a high, towering tower

655
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:37,064
飛ばす風船 カモフラージュ
Flying balloons, camouflage

656
00:40:37,064 --> 00:40:40,064
僕は君に笑ってほしいんだ
I want you to smile

657
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:43,064
満たされない穴は未完成の愛か
Is the unfilled hole an incomplete love?

658
00:40:43,064 --> 00:40:45,864
今は欺いたポーズで
For now, in a deceptive pose

659
00:40:46,064 --> 00:40:50,864
これまでは運命的だったけど
It has been fateful until now, but...

660
00:40:51,064 --> 00:40:54,064
退屈な日々を蹴散らして
Kicking away the boring days

661
00:40:54,064 --> 00:40:56,864
君と二人で
With just the two of us

662
00:40:56,964 --> 00:41:00,064
この街中を
In this town

663
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:05,864
泳げたら
If we could swim

664
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:13,564
それはどれだけ素敵なことでしょう？
How wonderful would that be?

665
00:41:14,064 --> 00:41:17,064
出したことないほど
More than I've ever put out

666
00:41:17,064 --> 00:41:19,064
大きな
A loud...

667
00:41:19,064 --> 00:41:21,864
声でやっと君に
...voice finally to you

668
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:24,864
伝わる
will reach

669
00:41:25,064 --> 00:41:27,864
歪なくらいが
Being a little distorted

670
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,264
きっとちょうどいいよね
is probably just right

671
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:34,064
世界の端と端を
Connecting the edges of the world

672
00:41:34,064 --> 00:41:38,064
結んで
Together

673
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:51,064
窓に飾った貝殻なぞって
Tracing the shells decorated on the window

674
00:41:51,064 --> 00:41:54,064
一人の宇宙を旅して
Traveling through my own universe alone

675
00:41:54,064 --> 00:41:59,064
それだけでも不自由ないけど
Even that alone is not inconvenient, but...

676
00:41:59,564 --> 00:42:02,064
僕は選んでみたいの
I want to try choosing

677
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:06,064
高鳴る心 なぞだらけの空は
A throbbing heart, the sky full of mysteries

678
00:42:06,064 --> 00:42:11,064
安全なループを 今 掻き消して
Erasing the safe loop now

679
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:20,064
君の手を握ってしまったら
If I end up holding your hand

680
00:42:20,064 --> 00:42:26,064
孤独を知らないこの街には
To this city that knows no loneliness

681
00:42:26,064 --> 00:42:30,064
もう二度と帰ってくることは
I probably won't be able to

682
00:42:30,064 --> 00:42:36,064
できないのでしょう
return ever again

683
00:42:37,064 --> 00:42:40,064
いくらでも迷いながら
While getting lost as much as we want

684
00:42:40,064 --> 00:42:43,064
いくらでも迷いながら
While getting lost as much as we want

685
00:42:43,064 --> 00:42:48,064
光も影も見に行こう
Let's go see both light and shadow

686
00:42:48,064 --> 00:42:51,064
歌って聴かせて
Sing and let me hear

687
00:42:51,064 --> 00:42:54,064
この話の続き
the continuation of this story

688
00:42:54,064 --> 00:42:57,064
連れて行って
Take me away

689
00:42:57,064 --> 00:43:00,064
見たことない星まで
to a star I've never seen

690
00:43:05,064 --> 00:43:08,064
世界の端と端を
Connecting the edges of the world

691
00:43:08,064 --> 00:43:13,064
結んで
Together

692
00:43:39,064 --> 00:43:45,064
壊れていたのは 世界でしょうか
Was it the world that was broken?

693
00:43:45,064 --> 00:43:51,064
間違っていたのは 世界でしょうか
Was it the world that was wrong?

694
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:58,064
あなたには朝がやってこない
Morning doesn't come for you

695
00:43:58,064 --> 00:44:05,064
だから あなたの「おはよう」はもう聞けない
So I can't hear your "Good morning" anymore

696
00:44:05,064 --> 00:44:12,064
時が戻れば なんて思いながら
While thinking, "If only time could go back"

697
00:44:12,064 --> 00:44:18,064
私はあなたを こんな檻に閉じ込めてる
I'm locking you up in a cage like this

698
00:44:18,064 --> 00:44:24,064
声が枯れるまで 歌い続ければ
If I keep singing until my voice gives out

699
00:44:25,064 --> 00:44:30,064
きっと 気がついてくれるよね
Surely you'll notice me

700
00:44:35,064 --> 00:44:41,064
またいつか 光の降る街を
Again someday, in the city where light falls

701
00:44:41,064 --> 00:44:47,564
手を繋いで歩きましょう
Let's walk hand in hand

702
00:44:48,064 --> 00:44:54,064
空の青さを忘れるなんて
To forget the blueness of the sky...

703
00:44:54,564 --> 00:44:59,064
全く本当にあなたは馬鹿ね
...you really are a fool

704
00:45:10,072 --> 00:45:13,072
あなたの花が明けるまで
Until Your Flower Dawns

705
00:45:13,192 --> 00:45:16,922
壊れていたのは世界ではなくて
It wasn't the world that was broken

706
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:26,182
間違っていたのはあなただけれど
It was you who was wrong, but...

707
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:32,912
嘘で固められた世界でも
Even in a world built on lies

708
00:45:32,912 --> 00:45:39,222
ごめんね あなたに生きててほしいの
I'm sorry, I want you to live

709
00:45:39,222 --> 00:45:46,102
時が戻ればなんて思いながら
While thinking "if only time could turn back"

710
00:45:46,102 --> 00:45:52,252
私はもう少しだけ諦めてる
I've given up just a little bit more

711
00:45:52,252 --> 00:46:00,122
声が枯れるまで歌い続けるのは
Continuing to sing until my voice withers

712
00:46:00,122 --> 00:46:06,192
あなたのためだけじゃない
Isn't just for your sake

713
00:46:06,192 --> 00:46:14,152
またいつか春の空を
Let's walk under the spring sky

714
00:46:14,152 --> 00:46:21,222
二人手をつないで歩きましょう
Holding hands again someday

715
00:46:21,222 --> 00:46:28,112
何も知らないあなたでいいの
It's okay for you to know nothing

716
00:46:28,112 --> 00:46:34,292
私はどこにも行かないから
Because I'm not going anywhere

717
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:06,212
Lily Lily 君の幸せなんて
Lily, Lily, your happiness...

718
00:47:06,212 --> 00:47:13,272
願ってたあの頃に戻れないんだ
I can't return to those days when I wished for it

719
00:47:13,272 --> 00:47:20,192
知ってるよ どうにもならないことも
I know, even the things that can't be helped

720
00:47:20,192 --> 00:47:26,252
でも嫌いになんてなれなかったよ
But I couldn't come to hate you

721
00:47:26,252 --> 00:47:32,172
またいつか光を歌いながら
Let's walk holding hands again someday

722
00:47:32,172 --> 00:47:39,222
二人手をつないで歩きましょう
Singing of the light

723
00:47:39,222 --> 00:47:46,152
明けない夜はないと教えてくれたこと
That you taught me there's no night that doesn't end

724
00:47:46,152 --> 00:47:52,212
私の手を引いてくれたこと
That you took my hand

725
00:47:52,212 --> 00:48:00,072
あなたを忘れないよ
I won't forget you

726
00:48:00,072 --> 00:48:03,192
Lily Lily 僕本当は君が好きだよ
Lily, Lily, I really love you

727
00:48:03,192 --> 00:48:06,222
Lily Lily 君はどう？
Lily, Lily, how about you?

728
00:48:06,222 --> 00:48:13,322
私もあなたが好きよ
I love you too

729
00:48:35,072 --> 00:48:40,072
ライカ
Leica

730
00:48:56,192 --> 00:48:59,152
一瞬で過ぎてった春も
Spring that passed in an instant

731
00:48:59,152 --> 00:49:03,212
夏も秋も美しくて
Summer and autumn were beautiful too

732
00:49:03,212 --> 00:49:07,252
もうこんな僕はそのまま連れて行って
Just take me away as I am

733
00:49:07,252 --> 00:49:10,292
冬を待つ君の赤いマフラー
Your red scarf waiting for winter

734
00:49:10,292 --> 00:49:13,722
赤くなった頬が可愛くて
Your reddened cheeks were cute

735
00:49:13,722 --> 00:49:18,192
ライカで写した君の顔を思い出した
I remembered your face taken with the Leica

736
00:49:18,192 --> 00:49:21,122
I miss you このまま
I miss you, if only I could

737
00:49:21,122 --> 00:49:24,252
いってしまえたらなんて
Just go like this

738
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:29,322
最低な僕は歌う君に愛を
The worst me sings love to you

739
00:49:29,322 --> 00:49:32,152
I love you このまま
I love you, if only I could

740
00:49:32,152 --> 00:49:34,692
いってしまえたら僕は
Just go like this

741
00:49:34,692 --> 00:49:38,222
泣いていた君の涙さえ愛おしくて
Even your tears as you cried are precious

742
00:49:38,222 --> 00:49:40,292
舞い散るな
Don't scatter

743
00:49:50,122 --> 00:49:53,192
三秒前に泣き止んだ
You stopped crying three seconds ago

744
00:49:53,192 --> 00:49:57,152
君の長い髪が愛おしくて
Your long hair is precious

745
00:49:57,152 --> 00:50:00,072
もう冬が終わる春が来る
Winter is already ending, spring is coming

746
00:50:01,113 --> 00:50:02,146
きみはいったい...
Who are you exactly...

747
00:50:02,146 --> 00:50:04,546
君は春のように優しかった
You were kind like spring

748
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:06,680
それはきっと恋だと気づいた
I realized it must be love

749
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,246
夢の中でも君に会えたなら
If only I could see you even in my dreams

750
00:50:09,246 --> 00:50:11,880
なんて言うをー
What would I say?

751
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,213
I miss you このまま行ってしまえたらなんて
I miss you, if only I could just leave like this

752
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:18,480
青春は青い春を連れ去ってしまう
Youth carries away the blue spring

753
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,480
I love you このまま行ってしまえたら僕は
I love you, if only I could just leave like this, I...

754
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,946
泣いている君を抱きしめてしまいたい今
want to hold you while you're crying right now

755
00:50:25,946 --> 00:50:28,246
わかってるよ
I know

756
00:51:05,846 --> 00:51:08,646
I miss you このまま行ってしまえたらなんて
I miss you, if only I could just leave like this

757
00:51:08,646 --> 00:51:11,746
最低な僕は君を汚していたくて
The worst me wanted to stain you

758
00:51:11,746 --> 00:51:14,746
I love you このまま行ってしまえたら僕は
I love you, if only I could just leave like this, I...

759
00:51:14,746 --> 00:51:17,513
最愛の君に愛を伝えられたなら
If only I could have conveyed my love to my beloved you

760
00:51:17,513 --> 00:51:19,413
サヨナラさ
It's goodbye

761
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,513
はい。というわけで、ここまで見てくれてありがとう！
Okay. So, thank you for watching this far!

762
00:52:02,513 --> 00:52:05,213
最後の曲と重大発表がまだ実は残ってるんですが、
Actually, the final song and a major announcement are still to come,

763
00:52:05,213 --> 00:52:07,880
その前に、グッズの告知を先にしたいと思います！
but before that, I'd like to announce the goods first!

764
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,380
ででーん！

768
00:52:17,213 --> 00:52:19,546

So then, first is the full set purchase bonus,

769
00:52:19,546 --> 00:52:22,646
え、まずここがもうメインというか、もうでっかい、もうでっかいところなんですけど、

770
00:52:22,646 --> 00:52:24,513
なんと！今回なんですけど、これ多分、
unbelievably! This time, this is probably...

771
00:52:24,513 --> 00:52:27,646
最初で最後レベルだと思います。
...on a "first and last time" level.

774
00:52:33,346 --> 00:52:36,646
数量限定じゃないのは多分なんですけど、最初で最後かなーって思います。
It's not limited in quantity, so I think it's probably the first and last time.

775
00:52:36,646 --> 00:52:38,346
この戦争を俺が止めに来た。
"I've come to stop this war."

776

So then, I'd finally like to properly introduce the first item of goods.

779
00:52:46,813 --> 00:52:48,513
まず一個目！キラキラ☆2層アクリルパネル！
First item! Sparkling 2-Layer Acrylic Panel!

780
00:52:48,513 --> 00:52:51,180
ということでキラキラ☆2層アクリルパネル。
So, it's the Sparkling 2-Layer Acrylic Panel.

783
00:52:55,913 --> 00:52:58,680
めっちゃ可愛いです。あの塩っ子がね、塩っ子足掴んでシオンがゲームしてる感じですね。
It's so cute. It's like Shion is playing a game while a Shiokko is grabbing her foot.

784
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,413
めっちゃ可愛いよねこれ本当に。お部屋にねあのぜひ飾ってほしいなって思います。
Isn't it really cute? I'd really love for you to display it in your room.

785
00:53:01,413 --> 00:53:04,313
今までね、アクリルパネルとかそういうものはあの出したことがなかったので、
I haven't released anything like an acrylic panel before,

786
00:53:04,313 --> 00:53:06,413
今回はですねアクリルパネルにしてみました。キラキラしててとっても可愛いです。

You definitely thought, "I want a tumbler."

791
00:53:14,313 --> 00:53:17,380
最近タンブラー欲しかったんだよねって思ってた。
"I've been wanting a tumbler lately."

792
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,513
シオンも思ってた。いやタンブラー欲しいなーって思ってた。
Shion thought so too. "I want a tumbler."

793

これめっちゃ可愛くてめっちゃこだわって作ったんですよ。
This is really cute and I put a lot of thought into making it.

794
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,346
そもそもあの中身が見える透明な蓋って書いてあってあの、そう中身が見えるんです、上から。
First off, it has a transparent lid that lets you see inside from above.

795
00:53:25,346 --> 00:53:28,246
で、蓋がシリコンになっててピンク色のシリコンになってて、
The lid is made of pink silicone,

796
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:31,313
外身があのピンクと薄紫のパステルカラーのグラデーションになってて、
and the body has a pastel pink and light purple gradient,

797
00:53:31,313 --> 00:53:33,646
でこのデザインが何て言うんだろうな、ちょっとぷっくりしたプリントになってる。
and the design is... how should I say, it's a slightly raised print.

798
00:53:33,646 --> 00:53:36,646
こう指で触ると、なんかちょっとだけあのポコっとしてる感じ。本当にもうちょっともう、
When you touch it with your finger, it feels a bit bumpy. Really just a little,

799
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:39,646
あの1ミリとかもうないレベルのポコって感じのめっちゃ可愛くて、
like, less than a millimeter of bumpiness, but it's really cute,

800
00:53:39,646 --> 00:53:41,446
そうステンレスでできてて、蓋はシリコン...

812
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:27,788
あのお茶とか入れて。キンキンに冷えたお茶、飲んでください。
Put some tea in it. Drink some ice-cold tea.

813
00:55:28,488 --> 00:55:30,388
というわけで、「激カワタンブラー」です。
Anyway, it's the "Super Cute Tumbler."

814
00:55:30,488 --> 00:55:33,788
これめっちゃいいよね。そう、ずっと作りたかったんだよ。

Ah, I put a lot of thought into this one too.

818
00:55:38,388 --> 00:55:41,288
マジで、毎回グッズめっちゃ全部こだわってんだけど。
Seriously, I'm picky about all my merch every time.

819
00:55:41,388 --> 00:55:43,788
でも本当に、マジでこだわってて。
But really, I was super particular about this.

820
00:55:43,888 --> 00:55:48,388
まず、この紐がね、紐に「Murasaki Shion」って書いてあるんだよね。
First, "Murasaki Shion" is written on the strap.

821
00:55:48,488 --> 00:55:50,888
このショルダーの紐に。これめっちゃよくて...
On this shoulder strap. This is really great...

822
00:55:50,988 --> 00:55:52,888
...なんか、あの、刺繍みたいになってて。
...it's like embroidery.

823
00:55:52,988 --> 00:55:54,488
ですごいおしゃれなんだよね。
It's very stylish.

824
00:55:54,588 --> 00:55:56,888

I aimed for a simple design...

825
00:55:56,988 --> 00:56:00,688

...one that those who know will recognize.

00:56:00,788 --> 00:56:04,288
あの、表は真っ黒のショルダーバッグなんだけど。
The front is a pitch-black shoulder bag.

827
00:56:04,388 --> 00:56:08,588
このメタルパーツって言ってね、あの、鉄みたいなパーツがついてて。
But it has these metal parts, like iron-like components.

828
00:56:08,688 --> 00:56:11,888
で、これがね、シオンの帽子になってるんだよね。
And these are shaped like Shion's hat.

829
00:56:12,388 --> 00:56:15,588
いや、これもね、見る人が見たら分かるやつだよね。
Yeah, this is another one of those "if you know, you know" things.

830
00:56:15,688 --> 00:56:17,888
で、内側の生地も、こうおしゃれな感じに...
The inner lining also has a stylish feel...

831
00:56:17,988 --> 00:56:19,888
...シンプルな感じにね、なってて。
...it's very simple.

832
00:56:20,188 --> 00:56:24,088
結構使いやすい、マジで使いやすいと思います。デザイン的にも。
It's very practical; I think it's really easy to use.

833
00:56:24,188 --> 00:56:25,788
でですね、タグはですね...
And the tag is...

834
00:56:25,888 --> 00:56:29,288
...あの、Tシャツとか、あの、ブルゾンとかについてたタグと...
...the same one used for the T-shirts and jackets.

835
00:56:29,388 --> 00:56:33,488
...同じタグになっていて。あの、ちょっとシオンブランドっぽくなってるよね。
It feels a bit like a "Shion Brand," right?

836
00:56:33,588 --> 00:56:37,388
あの、お揃いだから。で、可愛くできたかなって思ってます。
Because they match. I think it turned out cute.

837
00:56:37,488 --> 00:56:40,888
シンプルなので、ぜひ外に持ち運んで使ってください。
It's simple, so please take it out and use it.

将来的にシオンは、あの、塩っ子のみんなを全身...
In the future, I want to make it so all the Shiokkos...

842
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,588
...あの、シオンが出したグッズで、あの、歩けるように...
...can walk around completely dressed in Shion's merch.

843
00:56:51,688 --> 00:56:56,188
...あの、したいなと思いましたので。キャップを選ばせていただきました。
That's why I chose a cap.

844
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:59,288
キャップもね、まだ出したことがないグッズなのでね。
Caps are also something I haven't released before.

845
00:56:59,588 --> 00:57:04,388
これもね、結構シンプルな感じで。外で被りやすいようなデザインにしました。
I made it a simple design that's easy to wear outside.

846
00:57:04,488 --> 00:57:08,288
あのね、シオンの「S」にね、あの、帽子がついてて。
There's a hat on the "S" for Shion.

847
00:57:08,388 --> 00:57:11,388
もう、見る人が見たら分かる感じになってて。
Again, it's the kind of thing where if you know, you know.

848
00:57:11,488 --> 00:57:14,188
横にもね、ちょっとだけデザイン入ってて。
There's a bit of design on the side too.

849
00:57:14,288 --> 00:57:16,188
後ろに、あの、タグがついてて。
And a tag on the back.

00:57:16,288 --> 00:57:19,488
この金具で、サイズ調整ができるようになってます。
You can adjust the size with this clasp.

851
00:57:19,588 --> 00:57:23,688
金具もね、シルバーにして。あの、シンプルな感じでまとめました。
I made the clasp silver. I kept it all simple.

852
00:57:23,788 --> 00:57:25,288

863
00:58:01,488 --> 00:58:04,288
告知でね、「続きます」と言いましたが...
I said "it continues,"

864
00:58:04,388 --> 00:58:07,488
...何が続くのかですよね！
but I'm sure you're wondering what continues!

865
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:14,488
なんと！5周年記念に、オリ曲が出ます！
Believe it or not! I'm releasing an original song!

始めよう
let's begin.

877

Shall we dance!

878
00:59:03,988 --> 00:59:05,788
おとぎ話の主人公
The protagonist of a fairy tale

879
00:59:05,888 --> 00:59:09,188
いつも鏡の中で夢見てる
Always dreaming inside the mirror

880
00:59:09,288 --> 00:59:12,388
弱音だらけの私でも
Even though I'm full of complaints,

881
00:59:12,488 --> 00:59:15,588
画面の中では強くありたい
I want to be strong inside the screen.

882
00:59:15,688 --> 00:59:16,888
だけど
But...

883
00:59:17,488 --> 00:59:20,188
強がり　怖がり　寂しがり
Acting tough, being scared, feeling lonely,

884
00:59:20,288 --> 00:59:23,288
弱虫　言われてばかりで
I'm always being called a coward.

885
00:59:23,588 --> 00:59:26,588
思い出す度に震える声
My voice trembles every time I remember.

886
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,088
なんて
Just kidding...

887
00:59:29,188 --> 00:59:31,088
そんなの嘘っぱちだから
that's all a big lie.

888
00:59:31,188 --> 00:59:32,388
信じて
Trust me,

889
00:59:33,388 --> 00:59:35,488
私だけをみて
and look only at me.

890
00:59:35,588 --> 00:59:38,888
反撃開始のドレスを着て
Wearing a dress to start the counterattack,

891
00:59:38,988 --> 00:59:40,088
魔法
before the magic

892
00:59:41,188 --> 00:59:43,388
解ける前に

00:59:58,488 --> 00:59:59,688
これが
This is

高らかに
Louder,

902
01:00:04,296 --> 01:00:05,596
響かせ
let it ring out.

903
01:00:09,221 --> 01:00:10,496
「所詮は」だなんて
"After all," you say,

904
01:00:10,596 --> 01:00:11,696
分かったふりして口から出まかせで
pretending to know, just talking nonsense.

905
01:00:11,796 --> 01:00:13,196
「ホントは」だなんて
"In truth," you say,

906
01:00:13,296 --> 01:00:14,746
甘過ぎ軽口言いたくないんだって
I don't want to hear such sweet, cheap talk.

907
01:00:14,846 --> 01:00:17,396
ノイズ無視して全部笑い飛ばして
Ignoring the noise, laughing it all away,

908
01:00:17,496 --> 01:00:21,496
不安拭って立ち止まるな
wipe away the anxiety and don't stop!

909
01:00:21,896 --> 01:00:23,996
そらさないで
Don't look away,

910
01:00:24,096 --> 01:00:25,396
強くいさせて
let me stay strong.

911
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:26,896
アン・ドゥ・トロワ！
One, two, three!

912
01:00:27,196 --> 01:00:29,596
0時を回っても
Even after the clock strikes midnight,

913
01:00:29,896 --> 01:00:32,496
逃がさずに戦っているの
I'm fighting without letting go.

914
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:35,396
気高く華麗に
Nobly and elegantly,

915
01:00:35,496 --> 01:00:38,196
舞い上がる
I'll soar high!

916
01:00:38,296 --> 01:00:41,596
泣いてる暇なんかない
There's no time for crying!

917
01:00:51,596 --> 01:00:54,496
「タラレバ」なんかじゃなく
Not just "ifs" and "buts,"

918
01:00:54,696 --> 01:00:56,996
「これから」を生きたいの
I want to live for "what's next."

919
01:00:57,196 --> 01:00:59,896
反撃開始のドレスを着て
Wearing the dress of the counterattack,

920
01:01:00,096 --> 01:01:02,396
魔法が解ける前に
before the magic wears off.

921
01:01:05,196 --> 01:01:07,496
さあご覧あれ
Now, behold,

922
01:01:07,596 --> 01:01:09,096
君のシンデレラ
your Cinderella.

923
01:01:09,196 --> 01:01:10,496
アン・ドゥ・トロワ！
One, two, three!

924
01:01:10,596 --> 01:01:13,496
ガラスの靴履いて
Wearing the glass slippers,

925
01:01:13,696 --> 01:01:15,996
可愛く映ってますか？
do I look cute on screen?

926
01:01:16,196 --> 01:01:18,796
誇らしげに
With pride,

01:01:18,896 --> 01:01:21,096

I'll show you my dance.

928
01:01:21,596 --> 01:01:25,096
これが私なんだ
This is who I am.

929
01:01:25,596 --> 01:01:27,596

934
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:41,096

935
01:01:48,896 --> 01:01:50,196
あっ、ちょっと待って！
Ah, wait a second!
