88
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:21,333
「ど、大丈夫かな？えっと...」って。ねねのごまかしだよね。

00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:10,033
いや、トワからなのよ。
No, it's from Towa.

103
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:13,333
あ、そうなの？ちょっと乗ってよ、なんかコントとかさ。
Oh, is that so? Come on, play along, like a skit or something.

104
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,633
お前だよ、お前だよみたいの。やめてよ、ちょっと。
Like, "It's you," "No, it's you." Stop that, come on.

105
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,133
行こう、うちら行こう。バイバイ！頑張ってね！

00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:53,433
Lunch with me

113
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:08,533
続く起きた朝は...
On the morning after I woke up...

114
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:12,733
なんだかいつもより眠くて
I was somehow sleepier than usual

115
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:16,433
昨日の夜ずっと漫画を読んでたら
Because I stayed up late reading manga yesterday

116
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:20,133
眠れなくってさ
and I couldn't fall asleep

117
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:24,433
今頃そっちは、どこで何してるかななんて
I wonder where you are and what you're doing now

118
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,733
考えてたら心が、ふわっと軽くなるんだ
Thinking about it makes my heart feel light and airy

119
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:39,233
これは内緒なんだけど、昨日の漫画の
This is a secret, but in that manga yesterday,

120
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:48,533
主人公に君が ちょっと似てたんだよ
the main character looked a bit like you

121
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:54,233
ねぇ お昼 昼 昼 昼 昼 一緒に
Hey, lunch, lunch, lunch, lunch, lunch, together

122
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,033
食べよう ちょっとだけ
Let's eat, just for a bit

123
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:03,445
ちょっとだけおんなじ気持ち共有したくて
I just wanted to share the same feelings a little bit.

124
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:09,045
そう　キラキラキラキラ叩いても
Even if I strike those sparkling, sparkling things,

125
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:13,245
そっぽ向いたコトバ待っても
even if I wait for words that look away...

126
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:18,045
いつものキミでいいんだよ
You're fine just the way you always are.

127
00:10:18,845 --> 00:10:21,045
一緒に食べよう
Let's eat together.

128
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:43,045
ヒステリアずっとは　言えない地味な日々だけど
Plain days where I can't stay in hysteria forever,

129
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:50,045
何故だろう最近は　少しキラキラなんだ
but for some reason, they've been a bit sparkling lately.

130
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:57,645
どんなに直前に　嫌なことあっても
No matter what unpleasant things happen right before,

131
00:10:58,645 --> 00:11:05,045
キミに会えると思うと　ニヤけちゃってさ
just thinking I'll see you makes me grin.

132
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:08,545
ねえ　Oh キラキラキラキラ一緒に
Hey, oh, sparkling, sparkling together,

133
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:13,245
キラキラキラキラ食べよう
let's eat something sparkling, sparkling.

134
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:20,045
一人よりきっと楽しくなるから
Because it'll surely be more fun than being alone.

135
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:26,545
そう　キラキラキラキラ叩き出し
Right, striking out those sparkles,

136
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:32,045
変なコト考えないでよ
don't think about weird things.

137
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:36,545
まあ別にいいけど
Well, I don't really mind, though.

138
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:43,045
知ってるかな　キミがくれる
I wonder if you know, each and every word

139
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:50,045
コトバひとつひとつ
that you give to me...

140
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:56,545
嬉しくなったり楽しくなったり　不思議なパワーを感じる
Makes me happy and makes me excited, I feel a mysterious power.

141
00:11:57,045 --> 00:12:04,545
ってコト
...is what I'm saying.

142
00:12:06,845 --> 00:12:14,045
ねえ　Oh キラキラキラキラ一緒に　キラキラキラキラ食べよう
Hey, oh, sparkling, sparkling together, let's eat something sparkling, sparkling.

143
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:22,045
ちょっとだけおんなじ気持ち共有したくて
I just wanted to share the same feelings a little bit.

144
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:26,545
そう　キラキラキラキラ叩いても
Even if I strike those sparkling, sparkling things,

145
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:30,545
そっぽ向いたコトバ待っても
even if I wait for words that look away...

146
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:35,545
いつでもキミがいいんだよ
It's always you that I want.

147
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:38,545
一緒に食べよう
Let's eat together.

148
00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:25,045
Palette

149
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:45,045
風に吹かれて　誰も気づかぬほど　区別がつかない　モノクロの世界
Blown by the wind, so much so that no one notices, a monochrome world where nothing is distinct.

150
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:57,645
色を足しても　何も見えなくて　まるで私は　息を止めていた
Even if I added color, I could see nothing; it was as if I was holding my breath.

151
00:14:02,845 --> 00:14:09,045
もういいよ　遠くても　叶えたい　私は
It's okay now, even if it's far, I want to make it come true.

152
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:15,245
この世界　想いを　抱きしめていたいのに
I want to embrace my feelings in this world, and yet...

153
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:21,245
夢のキャンバスに　居続ける意味は
The meaning of continuing to stay on this canvas of dreams,

154
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:30,045
この胸に　輝いている　ストーリー
is the story shining within my heart.

155
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:50,045
数えることに　意味などないけれど　拾い集めた　カケラをしまうの
There's no meaning in counting them, but I'll store away the fragments I've gathered.

156
00:14:50,645 --> 00:15:00,045
そして夜はその冷たさを　溶かして手を伸ばし
And then the night melts that coldness, and reaches out its hand...

157
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:02,457
...伸ばした もういいよ
...outreached. It's fine now.

158
00:15:02,457 --> 00:15:05,157
遠くても 届けたい
Even from afar, I want to reach you.

159
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:08,357
私は 受け止めてゆく
I will accept it all.

160
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:13,257
涙も 抱きしめていたいのに
Even though I want to embrace these tears.

161
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:16,657
夢のキャンバスに
On the canvas of my dreams,

162
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:19,457
心込めるのは
I pour my heart into it,

163
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:22,357
この空に
In this sky,

164
00:15:22,357 --> 00:15:25,857
描きだしてゆく
Drawing out a...

165
00:15:25,857 --> 00:15:30,057
ストーリー
...story.

166
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:41,557
そして夜は その冷たさを
And the night, melting that coldness,

167
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:44,857
溶かして手を 伸ばした
reached out its hand.

168
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:48,857
もういいの 遠くても
It's fine now. Even from afar,

169
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:52,557
叶えたい 私の
I want to fulfill it. My...

170
00:15:52,557 --> 00:15:56,557
この世界 想いも
...world, my feelings too,

171
00:15:56,557 --> 00:16:00,057
言葉で包ま
wrapped in words.

172
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:03,557
夢のキャンバスに
On the canvas of my dreams,

173
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:06,557
色を足してゆく
I keep adding colors,

174
00:16:06,557 --> 00:16:09,557
この胸に
In this chest,

175
00:16:09,557 --> 00:16:12,557
今 輝いて
shining now.

176
00:16:12,557 --> 00:16:15,557
強くなくてもいい
It's okay not to be strong.

177
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,557
壊れかけてもいい
It's okay to be breaking.

178
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:21,557
この心は
This heart will...

179
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:24,057
永遠に羽ばたいて
...flap its wings forever.

180
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:27,557
響くように
So it resonates,

181
00:16:27,557 --> 00:16:29,857
塗り替えていく
repainting it.

182
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:34,057
Palette

183
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:43,057
GHOST

184
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:47,057
パッと弾けた感情に
In emotions that burst forth suddenly,

185
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:53,057
言い訳を並べて過ごした
I spent my time lining up excuses.

186
00:17:53,057 --> 00:17:58,557
勝手も知らない街明かり
In city lights I don't even know my way around,

187
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:03,557
君だけを待って嘘ついた
I lied, waiting only for you.

188
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:09,057
信じたくもないままで踊っている
I'm dancing without even wanting to believe.

189
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:12,457
示すために
In order to show it,

190
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:17,057
連ね続けた言葉
these words I've kept stringing together.

191
00:18:17,057 --> 00:18:19,557
見えないの僕が
Can't you see me?

192
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,557
僕のこの声が
Can you hear my voice?

193
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:26,557
聞こえてる
Can you hear it?

194
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:29,557
Dancer in the dark

195
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:32,557
シルエットすらも
Even my silhouette

196
00:18:32,557 --> 00:18:35,857
透明できっと
is surely transparent.

197
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:38,257
不恰好だけれど
It's awkward, but...

198
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:41,557
せめて声を枯らそう
...at least let's cry out until my voice goes hoarse.

199
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:44,257
必死に縋っても
Even if I cling desperately,

200
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,557
ずっと証明を
always seeking proof,

201
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:50,057
ねえゴーストみたいだ
hey, it's like a ghost.

202
00:18:59,057 --> 00:19:04,257
散々恨んだ明るさと
With the brightness I've resented so much,

203
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:09,557
意味ありげに伸びていく影
and the shadow that stretches meaningfully.

204
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:15,057
淡々と過ぎた一粒の
With a single drop that passed nonchalantly,

205
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:20,057
君の言葉で泣きたくなった
I felt like crying at your words.

206
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:26,057
大切にしたいものが零れてゆく
The things I want to treasure are spilling away.

207
00:19:26,057 --> 00:19:29,057
示すままに
Just as shown,

208
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:33,457
綴り続けたい言葉
the words I want to keep spelling out.

209
00:19:33,457 --> 00:19:36,557
見えてるの僕が
Can you see me?

210
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:39,557
僕のこの声が
My voice...

211
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:42,557
届いてる
...is reaching you.

212
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,557
Dancer in the dark

213
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:47,557
シルエットすらも
Even my silhouette

214
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:50,557
透明できっと
is surely transparent.

215
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:54,557
不恰好だけれど
It's awkward, but...

216
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:57,057
だから叫んで足掻いて
So shout and struggle,

217
00:19:57,057 --> 00:20:00,057
裸足のまま走って
and run while barefoot.

218
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,369
ねぇ ねえ
Hey, hey

219
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:02,569
気付いて
Notice me

220
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,269
教えてよ
Tell me

221
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,069
答えは
The answer is

222
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:15,569
こんな僕の心まで馬鹿にしないで
Don't even make fun of a heart like mine

223
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:36,569
灰色の街が笑ってるよう
The gray city seems to be laughing

224
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:41,569
足取りも重くなる
My footsteps grow heavy too

225
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:45,069
声を枯らして叫んで
Shout until hoarse, scream

226
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:48,369
諍って 裸足で走り続けて
Struggle, keep running barefoot

227
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:51,369
変わらないように
So things don't change

228
00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:54,469
諦めないように
So I don't give up

229
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:58,369
つなぎつづけるだけだ
I'll just keep on connecting

230
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:04,069
見つけてよ僕を
Find me

231
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:08,869
僕のこの声が聞こえてる？
Can you hear this voice of mine?

232
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:12,469
繊細に叩くシルエットすらも
Even the delicately beating silhouette...

233
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:17,369
透明できっと不格好だけれど
...is transparent and surely unsightly

234
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:21,069
でもせめて声を
But at least let this voice...

235
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:22,769
枯らそう
...go hoarse

236
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:26,569
必死に縋ってもずっと
Even if I desperately cling on,

237
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:30,069
署名を願うよ
I'll always wish for a signature

238
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:33,069
ねえゴーストみたいだ
Hey, it's like a ghost

239
00:21:56,269 --> 00:22:00,669
ありがとうございましたー！
Thank you very much!

240
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:04,069
はーい、じゃあ二人おいでー。
Okay, come on out you two.

241
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:18,069
というわけで、えー、ソロパートをお聴きいただきました。
And so, you just heard the solo parts.

242
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:20,569
イエーイ！
Yay!

243
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:24,569
えー待って、ちょっとここさ言いたいんだけど、
Wait, I want to say something about this.

244
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:28,069
ソロパートあるよって話をさ、このライブが決まってあったじゃん。
When this live was decided, we talked about solo parts, right?

245
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:32,069
そんときに、「え、これシャッフル決めたのトワなんです。」
At that time, Towa was the one who decided on this shuffle.

246
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:36,569
天才！トワ様天才！
Genius! Towa-sama is a genius!

247
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:41,069
いやそう、なんかソロって言ったらなんかいろんな振り幅があるけど、
Yeah, when you say "solo," there's a lot of range, but

248
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:46,069
ほら、せっかくみんなオリ曲持ってるからそれをシャッフルしないかっていう提案をして、
since we all have original songs, I proposed shuffling them,

249
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:49,069
お二人がいいよって、本当に本当によかった。
and you two said yes. I'm really, really glad.

250
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:54,069
トワ、トワだけ！もう、カタンカタン！
Towa, only Towa! Totally won!

251
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:57,069
助かったわー、トワ。
You saved us, Towa.

252
00:22:57,569 --> 00:23:03,069
で、実際、えー、ランチウィズミー、ねねの曲をトワが歌って、
So, actually, Towa sang Nene's song "Lunch with Me",

253
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:08,569
トワの曲パレットをすいちゃんが歌って、すいちゃんの曲ゴーストをねねが歌いました。
Suisei sang Towa's "Palette", and Nene sang Suisei's "GHOST".

254
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:10,569
みんなどうだった歌ってみて？
How was it for everyone, trying to sing them?

255
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:12,569
じゃ、まずトワから言うね、一番最初。
Well, I'll go first, since I was first.

256
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:17,569
いやまず、ちょっとあの、大丈夫かなっていう。
Well, first off, I was like, "Is this gonna be okay?"

257
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:25,569
トワがランチウィズミー歌っていいのかなっていう不安はあったんだけど。
I was worried if it was okay for Towa to sing "Lunch with Me".

258
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:32,569
ぜ、めっちゃちょっと可愛いを意識して歌ってみたんだけど。
I tried to sing it while being very conscious of being cute.

259
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:37,069
いや可愛かったよ！全然可愛かった！踊りもめっちゃ可愛かったよ！
No, you were cute! You were totally cute! The dancing was really cute too!

260
00:23:37,069 --> 00:23:42,569
踊りの可愛さと歌のちょっとギャップで、どう、まあ。
With the gap between the cuteness of the dance and the singing, well...

261
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:48,569
ほら、TMT TMT TMT TMTって言われてる。
Look, everyone's saying TMT TMT TMT TMT.

262
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:50,069
天使しか言われてない。
They're only calling me an angel.

263
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:53,069
清楚すぎるだろｗ
Too pure, lol.

264
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:55,069
じゃ、はい、すいちゃん、トワのパレット。
Okay, next, Suisei with Towa's "Palette".

265
00:23:55,069 --> 00:24:00,069
すいちゃんは、トワの曲歌いました。トワの曲、とっても難しいね！
I sang Towa's song. Towa's songs are very difficult!

266
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:03,069
え、待って笑顔が怖い！何ですか、この難しさ！
Wait, your smile is scary! What's with this difficulty!

267
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:05,569
サイコパス彗星の完成それ。
That's the completion of Psychopath Suisei.

268
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:10,069
でもめっちゃかっこよかったよ！
But it was really cool!

269
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:13,569
ほら、しょっぱなからめっちゃ低いの。「風に吹かれて...」って。
Look, it's really low right from the start. "Blown by the wind..."

270
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:18,569
めっちゃ低くて、で、サビが「もういいよ」って。
It's so low, and then the chorus is like "I've had enough".

271
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:20,569
高っ！確かに確かに！
So high! True, true!

272
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:35,569
パレットのその、オケくださいって言われて、オケはトワのコーラス入りで。
When I was asked for the track for "Palette", it had Towa's backing vocals.

273
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:40,069
あ、そうそう。トワと共にね。でもランチウィズミーもね、ねねねのコーラスが入ってて。
Right. Together with Towa. "Lunch with Me" also had Nene's chorus.

274
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:45,069
ゴーストもすいちゃんのコーラスが入って。
And "GHOST" had Suisei's chorus too.

275
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:48,569
みんな入ってた！
Everyone's was in there!

276
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:50,069
はい、そんな感じで。ねねはどうでしたか？
Yes, it was like that. Nene, how was it for you?

277
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:54,069
いやもうね、すいちゃんの曲を歌うのね、なんかすごいプレッシャーがあったの！
Well, singing Suisei's song, I felt a lot of pressure!

278
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:58,569
分かるよ！分かるよ！
I get it! I get it!

279
00:24:58,569 --> 00:25:00,069
すごいプレッシャーで。もうめちゃめちゃ練習してから歌ったんだけど。
A lot of pressure. I practiced like crazy before singing it.

280
00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:01,381
あ、早かった。
Ah, that was fast.

281
00:25:01,381 --> 00:25:02,581
そんなことないって！
That's not true!

282
00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:03,581
そんなことないよ。
Not at all.

283
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:05,581
めっちゃ良かったよ。
It was really good.

284
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:08,581
なんか、あの、クリアな...
It was, like, clear...

285
00:25:08,581 --> 00:25:11,881
すいちゃんが、すいちゃんがすりガラスだとしたら...
If Suichan, if Suichan is frosted glass...

286
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:14,081
ねねはもう透明なガラス。
Nene is already transparent glass.

287
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,581
透明なガラス。

たくさんの遠回りを繰り返して
After taking many detours

380
00:30:46,426 --> 00:30:52,559
同じような街並みがただ通り過ぎた
Similar cityscapes just passed by

381
00:30:52,926 --> 00:30:59,226
窓に僕が映ってる
I'm reflected in the window

382
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:04,493
君は今もあの頃みたいにいるのだろうか
I wonder if you're still like you were back then

383
00:31:04,626 --> 00:31:09,626
ひしゃげて曲がったあの自転車で走り回った
Riding around on that dented and bent bicycle

384
00:31:10,026 --> 00:31:16,259
馬鹿々々しい綱渡り 膝に滲んだ血
A foolish tightrope walk, blood seeping on knees

385
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:23,259
今はなんだかひどく虚しい
Now, somehow, it feels terribly empty

386
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:34,226
どれだけ背丈が変わろうとも
No matter how much our heights change

387
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:39,259
変わらない何かが ありますように
I hope something remains unchanged

388
00:31:39,493 --> 00:31:45,126
くだらない面影に励まされ
Encouraged by a trivial image

389
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:51,193
今も歌う 今も歌う 今も歌う
I still sing, I still sing, I still sing

390
00:31:51,193 --> 00:31:57,193
La la la...

391
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:14,326
せわしなく街を走るタクシーに
In a taxi racing busily through the city

392
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:22,126
ぼんやりと背負われたまま くしゃみをした
Sneezed while being carried along absent-mindedly

393
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:28,259
窓の外を眺める
Looking out the window

394
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:32,959
心から震えたあの瞬間に
At that moment when my heart truly trembled

395
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:40,493
もう一度出会えたらいいと強く思う
I strongly hope we can meet once again

396
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:46,393
忘れることはないんだ
I will never forget it

397
00:32:46,593 --> 00:32:52,459
君は今もあの頃みたいにいるのだろうか
I wonder if you're still like you were back then

398
00:32:52,893 --> 00:32:58,426
靴片方 茂みに落として探し回った
Lost one shoe in the bushes and searched around

399
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:04,559
何があろうと僕らはきっとうまくいくと
Thinking we'd surely be fine no matter what

400
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:11,259
無邪気に笑えた日々を覚えている
I remember those days when we laughed innocently

401
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:22,259
どれだけ無様に傷つこうとも
No matter how wretchedly we get hurt

402
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:27,226
終わらない毎日を 花束に
Turning the never-ending days into a bouquet

403
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:32,959
くだらない面影を追いかけて
Chasing after a trivial image

404
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,826
今も歌う 今も歌う 今も歌う
I still sing, I still sing, I still sing

405
00:33:38,826 --> 00:33:44,893
La la la...

406
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:51,259
朝日が昇る前の欠けた月を
The waning moon before the sun rises—

407
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:56,626
君もどこかで見ているかな
I wonder if you're watching it too somewhere

408
00:33:56,926 --> 00:34:02,259
何故かわけもないのに胸が痛くて
For some reason, my chest hurts for no cause

409
00:34:02,526 --> 00:34:08,859
滲む顔 かすむ色
A blurring face, a hazy color

410
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:21,026
今更 悲しいと叫ぶには
To shout about sadness after all this time—

411
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,659
あまりに全てが遅すぎたかな
Perhaps everything was far too late

412
00:34:26,926 --> 00:34:32,493
もう一度初めから歩けるなら
If I could start walking from the beginning again

413
00:34:32,793 --> 00:34:38,293
すれ違うように君に会いたい
I'd want to meet you as if passing by

414
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:44,226
どれだけ背丈が変わろうとも
No matter how much our heights change

415
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:49,126
変わらない何かが ありますように
I hope something remains unchanged

416
00:34:49,293 --> 00:34:54,693
くだらない面影に励まされ
Encouraged by a trivial image

417
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:59,693
今も歌う 今も歌う 今も歌う
I still sing, I still sing, I still sing

418
00:35:08,646 --> 00:35:13,230
朝日が昇る前の欠けた月を
The crescent moon before the morning sun rises

419
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:19,563
君もどこかで見てるかな
Are you watching it from somewhere too?

420
00:35:19,563 --> 00:35:26,438
何もないと笑える朝引き寄せて
Wishing for a morning where I can laugh, saying there's nothing

421
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:32,521
始まりは青い色
The beginning is blue

422
00:35:56,605 --> 00:36:00,605
Departures 〜あなたにおくるアイの歌〜
Departures ~A Love Song for You~

423
00:35:56,688 --> 00:36:02,271
もうあなたから愛されることも
No longer being loved by you,

424
00:36:02,271 --> 00:36:10,021
必要とされることもない
Nor being needed by you...

425
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:17,521
そして私はこうして一人
And so, here I am, alone,

426
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:25,646
あの時あなたは何て言ったの？
What did you say back then?

427
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:32,688
届かない言葉は宙を舞う
Unreachable words dance in the air

428
00:36:32,688 --> 00:36:40,521
わかってるのに今日もしてしまう
Even though I know, I still do it today

429
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:48,563
叶わぬ願いごと
A wish that won't come true

430
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:56,105
離さないで ぎゅっと 手を握ってて
Don't let go, hold my hand tight

431
00:36:56,105 --> 00:37:03,605
あなたと二人 ずっと と言って
Say you'll be with me forever

432
00:37:03,605 --> 00:37:11,855
つないだその手は温かくて
That hand I held was so warm,

433
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:22,605
優しかった
And kind

434
00:37:29,605 --> 00:37:36,271
あなたはいつもそうやって私を
You always did that to me...

435
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:43,230
怒らせて最後に泣かすんだ
Making me angry and eventually making me cry

436
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:50,938
だけど後になってごめんねって言う
But later you'd say, "I'm sorry"

437
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:58,438
その顔 好きだった
I loved that face

438
00:38:00,438 --> 00:38:05,938
離さないで ぎゅっと そう思いきり
Don't let go, hold me as hard as you can

439
00:38:05,938 --> 00:38:13,355
あなたの腕の中にいたい
I want to be in your arms

440
00:38:13,355 --> 00:38:21,021
二人で おでこを合わせながら
With our foreheads pressed together,

441
00:38:21,021 --> 00:38:29,771
眠ろう
Let's sleep

442
00:38:30,313 --> 00:38:40,771
二度と会えないってことは知ってたの
I knew we'd never meet again

443
00:39:00,188 --> 00:39:06,563
離さないで ぎゅっと あなたが好き
Don't let go, I love you so much

444
00:39:06,563 --> 00:39:12,855
もう一度だって笑ってくれないの
Won't you smile for me just one more time?

445
00:39:12,855 --> 00:39:20,438
あなたのぬくもりが消えちゃう前に
Before your warmth disappears,

446
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:36,230
抱きしめて
Hold me tight

447
00:41:05,217 --> 00:41:25,217
※クリスマス3Dライブ※
*Christmas 3D Live*

448
00:41:05,217 --> 00:41:25,217
クリスマスソング
Christmas Song

449
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:37,465
どこかで鐘が鳴って
Somewhere a bell is ringing

450
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:44,298
らしくない言葉が浮かんで
Words that aren't like me come to mind

451
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:51,470
寒さが心地よくて
The cold feels comfortable

452
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,523
あれなんで恋なんかしてんだろう
Wait, why am I even in love?

453
00:41:57,187 --> 00:42:03,233
聖夜だなんだと繰り返す歌と
With songs about the holy night repeating

454
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:09,702
わざとらしくきらめく街のせいかな
Maybe it's because of the town's forced glitter

455
00:42:09,702 --> 00:42:15,665
会いたいと思う回数が
The number of times I want to see you

456
00:42:15,665 --> 00:42:22,163
会えないと痛いこの胸が
This heart that hurts when I can't see you

457
00:42:22,163 --> 00:42:28,231
君のこと想う顔教えようとしてる
It's trying to show me the face I make when I think of you

458
00:42:28,231 --> 00:42:34,620
いいよ そんなこと自分で分かってるよ
It's fine, I already know that myself

459
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:40,969
サンタとやらに頼んでも仕方ないよな
There's no use asking Santa or whoever

460
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:47,436
できれば横にいて欲しくて
If possible, I want you by my side

461
00:42:47,436 --> 00:42:53,710
どこにも行って欲しくなくて
I don't want you to go anywhere

462
00:42:53,710 --> 00:43:00,155
僕のことだけをずっと考えていて欲しい
I want you to only think about me all the time

463
00:43:00,155 --> 00:43:06,519
でもこんなこと言ったら格好悪いし
But saying things like this is uncool

464
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:12,867
長くなるだけだからまとめるよ
It'll just get long, so I'll sum it up

465
00:43:12,867 --> 00:43:16,243
君が好きだ
I love you

466
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:23,072
はしゃぐ恋人たちは
The frolicking lovers

467
00:43:23,072 --> 00:43:29,561
トナカイの角なんか生やして
Are wearing reindeer antlers

468
00:43:29,561 --> 00:43:36,129
よく人前でできるな
How can they do that in public?

469
00:43:36,129 --> 00:43:41,375
いや羨ましくなんてないけど
No, I'm not jealous or anything

470
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:47,814
君が喜ぶプレゼントってなんだろう
I wonder what gift would make you happy

471
00:43:47,814 --> 00:43:54,179
僕だけがあげられるものってなんだろう
I wonder what only I can give you

472
00:43:54,179 --> 00:44:00,471
大好きだと言った返事が
The reply when I told you I loved you

473
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:06,873
思ってたのとは違っていても
Even if it wasn't what I expected

474
00:44:06,873 --> 00:44:13,325
それだけで嫌いになんてなれやしないから
I could never hate you just for that

475
00:44:13,325 --> 00:44:19,584
星に願いをなんてさ 柄じゃないけど
Wishing on a star isn't really my style

476
00:44:19,584 --> 00:44:26,272
結局君じゃないと嫌なんだって
But in the end, it has to be you

477
00:44:26,272 --> 00:44:32,521
見上げてるんだ
I'm looking up

478
00:44:35,457 --> 00:44:41,838
あの時君に出会えた それだけで
Just meeting you at that time

479
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:51,224
自分も知らなかった自分が次から次に
Parts of myself I never knew kept coming out

480
00:44:51,224 --> 00:44:57,564
会いたいと毎日思ってて
Thinking every day that I want to see you

481
00:44:57,564 --> 00:45:00,117
それを君に知って欲しくて
I want you to know that

482
00:45:00,129 --> 00:45:04,229
…街に君を探してる
...I'm looking for you in the city.

483
00:45:04,229 --> 00:45:10,129
こんな日は他の誰かと笑ってるかな
I wonder if you're laughing with someone else on a day like this.

484
00:45:10,129 --> 00:45:16,329
胸の奥の奥が苦しくなる
The deepest part of my heart starts to ache.

485
00:45:16,629 --> 00:45:19,529
できれば横にいて欲しくて
If possible, I want you by my side.

486
00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:22,629
どこにも行って欲しくなくて
I don't want you to go anywhere.

487
00:45:22,629 --> 00:45:29,029
僕のことだけをずっと考えていて欲しい
I want you to only think about me forever.

488
00:45:29,129 --> 00:45:34,629
やっぱりこんなこと言ったら格好悪いし
As I thought, saying things like this makes me look uncool.

489
00:45:34,629 --> 00:45:41,129
長くなるだけだからまとめるよ
It'll only get long, so I'll wrap it up.

490
00:45:41,129 --> 00:45:45,929
君が好きだ
I love you.

491
00:45:46,129 --> 00:45:51,629
聞こえるまで何度だって言うよ
I'll say it as many times as it takes for you to hear.

492
00:45:51,629 --> 00:45:56,129
君が好きだ
I love you.

493
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:35,129
はーい！
Alright!

494
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:39,229
というわけでクリスマス衣装に着替えて
So, we've changed into our Christmas outfits

495
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:43,129
back numberさんの「クリスマスソング」をお届けしました！
and performed back number's "Christmas Song"!

496
00:46:43,129 --> 00:46:46,629
イェーイ！
Yay!

497
00:46:48,929 --> 00:46:50,929
なんか…ｗ
Somehow... lol

498
00:46:50,929 --> 00:46:52,529
なんで笑ってるの？ｗ
Why are you laughing? lol

499
00:46:52,529 --> 00:46:55,429
なんかさ、なんかトワ様一回さｗ
I mean, Towa-sama, at one point... lol

500
00:46:55,429 --> 00:46:57,529
なかった！そんなことなかった！ｗ
No! That didn't happen! lol

501
00:46:57,529 --> 00:46:58,829
なーかった！
It didn't happen!

502
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:04,329
トワすごいさ、マジですぐ表情に出る…ｗ
Towa, seriously, it shows on your face right away... lol

503
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:06,329
この…ｗ
This... lol

504
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:09,429
みんなももしかして見えちゃった？
Did everyone happen to see it too?

505
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:11,929
トワサンタが見えちゃったんじゃないの？一瞬ｗ
Didn't you see Towa-Santa for a split second? lol

506
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:15,029
ちょっとね、侵入してる形跡がありましたけれどもｗ
There were some signs of a break-in, though lol

507
00:47:15,229 --> 00:47:16,929
ちょっと面白かったｗ
It was a bit funny lol

508
00:47:16,929 --> 00:47:18,529
こらえるの必死だったｗ
I was desperate to hold it in lol

509
00:47:20,429 --> 00:47:24,129
はい！じゃあ、ここまでの曲の話をしていきたいと思います！
Alright! Then, let's talk about the songs we've done so far!

510
00:47:24,129 --> 00:47:25,929
歌ってきた曲！
The songs we sang!

511
00:47:25,929 --> 00:47:28,229
まずは「ロキ」、ねねとトワが歌いましたね！
First was "ROKI", which Nene and Towa sang!

512
00:47:28,229 --> 00:47:30,629
もうすっごい自由にいーやってた！ｗ
We were just doing it so freely! lol

513
00:47:30,629 --> 00:47:32,029
ぴんぴん！
Ping-ping!

514
00:47:32,029 --> 00:47:33,829
歌いました！オタ芸踊りました！
We sang it! And did our geek dance!

515
00:47:33,929 --> 00:47:36,529
練習と全然違うことしました！ｗ
We did something completely different from the rehearsal! lol

516
00:47:36,529 --> 00:47:38,329
グルグルしてましたねｗ
You guys were spinning around lol

517
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:39,529
グルグルしちゃったｗ
We ended up spinning lol

00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:48,129
すごいいかったよ！
It was really good!

521
00:47:48,129 --> 00:47:50,229
おっ、これ！おっ、これね！
Oh, this! Oh, this one!

522
00:47:50,229 --> 00:47:52,329
言っていいかな？言っちゃえ、言っちゃえ！
Can I say it? Go ahead, go ahead!

523
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:53,529
寄ったら？
How about getting closer?

524
00:47:53,529 --> 00:47:54,729
寄るわｗ
I'll get closer lol

525
00:47:54,729 --> 00:47:56,529
寄りな、寄りなｗ
Get close, get close lol

That's right, we were working hard on it aiming for this day!

531
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:14,429
はい！そうなの！
Yes! Exactly!

532
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:17,629
トワのチャンネルでアップ予定な動画なので、
It's scheduled to be uploaded on Towa's channel,

00:48:28,129 --> 00:48:31,129
ねねすいの「DEPARTURES」、あなたに贈る愛の歌。
Nene-Sui's "DEPARTURES", a love song dedicated to you.

537
00:48:31,129 --> 00:48:34,329
どうだった？切な可愛いみたいな感じじゃなかった？
How was it? Wasn't it like painfully cute?

538
00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:36,629
いや、助け…良かったよね！
No, it help... It was great, right!

539
00:48:36,629 --> 00:48:38,329
歌、良かったよねー！
The singing was great!

540
00:48:38,629 --> 00:48:41,329
すごーい！最後のところめっちゃ凄いと思った、本当に！
Amazing! I thought the last part was really incredible, seriously!

541
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:43,229
いや、でもねねちもすごい頑張って…
No, but Nene-chi also worked really hard...

542
00:48:43,229 --> 00:48:46,429
うぁー！頑張って…ねっ、一緒に歌ってた。
Waa! She worked hard... yeah, we sang it together.

543
00:48:46,429 --> 00:48:49,129
ね、ねねちもめっちゃ必死だったからさｗ
Yeah, Nene-chi was really desperate too lol

544
00:48:49,629 --> 00:48:53,129
私ね、このあと「クリスマスソング」歌うじゃないですか。
You know, I'm going to sing "Christmas Song" after this.

545
00:48:53,129 --> 00:48:56,129
で、ここで気づいたんですよ。「クリスマスソング」歌いながら私気づいたんですけど、
And I realized something. While singing "Christmas Song", I noticed...

546
00:48:56,129 --> 00:48:58,929
今日バラードばかり歌ってる。ｗ
We're singing nothing but ballads today. lol

547
00:48:58,929 --> 00:49:00,729
確かに！
True!

548
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:04,329
でしょ？でもクリスマスっぽいよね、なんかバラードって。確かに、確かに。
Right? But ballads feel Christmassy. True, true.

549
00:49:04,329 --> 00:49:08,629
今日はね、セトリはクリスマスっぽいヤツを選んできたんでね。
Today, I chose a setlist with a Christmas vibe.

550
00:49:08,629 --> 00:49:10,929
泣いたって、泣いたって！
People cried! People cried!

551
00:49:10,929 --> 00:49:12,929
泣いたも。助かる、涙助かるｗ
We cried too. It's a lifesaver, those tears are a lifesaver lol

552
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:14,729
涙助かる。泣きそうだったｗ
Tears are a lifesaver. I almost cried lol

553
00:49:14,729 --> 00:49:17,629
本当にｗ
Seriously lol

554
00:49:18,629 --> 00:49:23,329
「クリスマスソング」もね、みんなで「ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！」ってしてねｗ
Even for "Christmas Song", everyone was going "Hai! Hai! Hai! Hai!" lol

555
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:28,129
これ、なんと…始まる前のリハの時に、
This, believe it or not... during the rehearsal before the show,

556
00:49:28,129 --> 00:49:32,029
じゃんけんをして勝った人がセンター。ｗ
we played rock-paper-scissors, and the winner got to be the center. lol

557
00:49:32,029 --> 00:49:33,429
そうそうそうｗ
Yeah, yeah, yeah lol

558
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:36,629
すいちゃんが勝ったんだよね！じゃんけんで勝ってる！
Sui-chan won, right! I'm winning at rock-paper-scissors!

559
00:49:36,629 --> 00:49:40,129
「よっしゃー！」つって、センターいただきましたとｗ
I was like "Yessir!" and took the center position lol

560
00:49:41,329 --> 00:49:44,329
ちょっとあの台本ペラペラ…あっ、どうもどうも、すみません、すみませんｗ
Wait, the script flipping... Oh, hello hello, sorry, sorry lol

561
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:51,629
はい！そして次でなんと、もう一時間の最後の曲になってしまうんですが、
Okay! And next, somehow, is already the last song of the hour,

562
00:49:51,629 --> 00:49:53,129
あー！

599
00:51:20,641 --> 00:51:26,141
はい！いやぁ、ちょっとね、今日最初、機材トラブルでちょっと遅れちゃったんですけど、
Yes! Well, we were delayed a bit at first today due to equipment trouble,

600
00:51:26,641 --> 00:51:31,141
まぁ、すごいねねは、本当に二人を呼んでよかったと思いました、今日。
but Nene really felt so glad to have invited you two today.

601
00:51:30,941 --> 00:51:33,341
あ、本当に？ 楽しかったよ、今日。
Oh, really? I had fun today.

602
00:51:33,441 --> 00:51:36,641
本当に？ いや、でもダンスの練習の時からずっと楽しかった。
Really? But it's been fun ever since we started dance practice.

603
00:51:36,341 --> 00:51:38,341
楽しかった！ 楽しかった！
It was fun! It was fun!

604
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:42,341
本当に楽しかったし、先生も見てくれてるらしいから...
It was really fun, and I heard our teacher is watching, so...

605
00:51:41,941 --> 00:51:44,341
先生ーーー！
Sensei---!

606
00:51:44,341 --> 00:51:45,741
ありがとうございました！
Thank you so much!

607
00:51:45,741 --> 00:51:47,141
ねねミスったよ！
Nene messed up!

608
00:51:47,341 --> 00:51:53,141
ねねち、なんかずっと、「はぁー！」「ひぃー！」とか言いながら踊っててさ。
Nene-chi was dancing while constantly going 'Haa!' and 'Hee!'.

609
00:51:53,341 --> 00:51:57,341
そう、レッスンのとき、間違えると悲鳴が出ちゃうんだよね。
Yeah, during lessons, I'd end up screaming whenever I made a mistake.

610
00:51:55,941 --> 00:52:00,641
そうそう、「ひぃー！」っつって。もう録画したビデオに残ったよ、全部。
Right, like 'Hee!'. It's all captured in the recorded videos.

611
00:52:00,341 --> 00:52:01,341
本当だよ！
It's true!

612
00:52:02,141 --> 00:52:04,341
はい！ それでは...！
Alright! Now then...!

613
00:52:05,641 --> 00:52:09,341
えー、そろそろ最後の曲にいきましょうか、皆さん。
It's about time to move on to the final song, everyone.

614
00:52:08,941 --> 00:52:09,941
はい！
Yes!

615
00:52:10,141 --> 00:52:14,941
じゃあ、立ち位置について...。ちょっと先生見てて、絶対に次は間違えないから！
Let's get into position... Teacher, watch me, I definitely won't mess up this time!

616
00:52:15,641 --> 00:52:18,541
それでは、最後の曲です。聴いてください。
Now, the final song. Please listen.

617
00:52:18,941 --> 00:52:19,541
せーの、
One, two...

618
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:22,141
スノーハレーション！
Snow halation!

619
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:35,141
Snow halation

620
00:52:37,441 --> 00:52:41,941
不思議だね 今の気持ち
It's mysterious, this feeling I have right now

621
00:52:42,341 --> 00:52:46,941
空から降ってきたみたい
It feels as if it fell from the sky

622
00:52:48,641 --> 00:52:53,341
特別な季節の色が
The colors of this special season

623

ときめきを見せるよ
fill my heart with excitement

624
00:52:59,941 --> 00:53:04,341
初めて出会った時から
Ever since the first time we met

625
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:10,941
予感に騒ぐ心のメロディ
A premonition has stirred the melody of my heart

626
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:12,741
とめられない
I can't stop it

627
00:53:12,741 --> 00:53:14,541
とまらない
it won't stop

628
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:16,141
なぜ
why?

629
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:22,141

631
00:53:27,941 --> 00:53:32,941
想いが重なるまで
Until our feelings coincide

00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:39,141
待てずに 悔しいけど 好きって純情
It's frustrating that I can't wait, but my love is pure

微熱の中 ためらってもダメだね
Even if I hesitate in this slight fever, it's no use

634
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:51,641
飛び込む勇気に賛成 まもなくさ
I'm for the courage to dive in; it's almost time

635
00:54:00,341 --> 00:54:04,741
音もなく気配もなく
Without a sound, without a sign

636
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:10,141
静かに運命は変わる
fate silently changes

637
00:54:11,941 --> 00:54:16,341
これからの未来に胸の
Thinking about the future from now on

638
00:54:16,641 --> 00:54:21,141

No matter where you are, anywhere, fly high

642
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:44,741
急いで いつの間にか
Hurry... before I knew it

643
00:54:45,341 --> 00:54:50,141
大きくなりすぎた True emotion
this true emotion has grown too large

644
00:54:50,941 --> 00:54:55,941
夢だけ見てるようじゃ
It's painful to only be dreaming...

645
00:54:56,341 --> 00:55:00,141
辛いよ 恋人は...
my beloved...

646
00:55:00,453 --> 00:55:01,953
吐息混じりの
With breath mixed in...

647

距離が
The distance between us...

648
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:05,953

Send it, to this aching sadness...

652
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:44,353
名前をつけようか Snow halation
...should we give it a name? "Snow halation"

653
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:51,353
想いが重なるまで
Until our feelings overlap...

654
00:55:51,953 --> 00:55:55,353
待てずに悔しいけど
I can't wait, it's frustrating...

655
00:55:55,553 --> 00:55:57,453

00:55:57,753 --> 00:55:59,953
微熱の中
In this slight fever...

657
00:56:00,153 --> 00:56:02,753
