00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:27,428
サクラがさくよ
The cherry blossoms are blooming

6
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:36,148
見なれたいつもの坂道に
On the familiar slope we always take

7
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:41,808
あぁ 別れを
Ah, this farewell...

Lyrics/Composition: ryo

9
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:15,548
泣いて笑った
We cried and laughed

10
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:21,848
あの日々 なんだか昨日のことのよう
Those days somehow seem like only yesterday

11
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:27,388
この道はそう
This road, yes

12
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:31,548
未来へ続く道
Is a road leading to the future

13
00:06:31,548 --> 00:06:36,708
そんな気がしたの
That's how I felt

14
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:45,628
例年より早い開花
The blossoms opened earlier than usual this year

15
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:51,528
そう 君は嬉しがってた
Yeah, you were so happy about it

16
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:57,448
私は笑って「そうだね」って言った
I laughed and said, "You're right"

17
00:06:57,448 --> 00:07:03,588
あと少ししたらもう ここには戻れないのに
Even though in just a little while,
we won't be able to come back here anymore

18
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:10,228
言葉じゃうまく言えない想い
These feelings I can't put into words well

19
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:15,548
君に打ち明けるとしたらなんて
If I were to confess them to you, what would I say?

20
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:18,428
伝えよう
I'll tell you

21
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:22,568
最初で最後
For the first and last time

22
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:28,028
一緒に帰った道は 私にとって特別な思い出
The road we walked home together
is a special memory for me

23
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:33,488
忘れないよ さよならメモリーズ
I'll never forget. Farewell memories

24
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:39,008
春が来たら それぞれの道を
When spring comes, we'll each go our separate ways

25
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:50,328
また会える日を願って
Hoping for the day we can meet again

26
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:57,488
「さよなら」小さくつぶやいた
I whispered "Goodbye" softly

27
00:07:57,488 --> 00:08:03,488
空はあの日と変わらず青くて
The sky was as blue as it was that day

28
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:10,588
だからちょっと泣けた
So I cried a little bit

29
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:20,608
わざと遠回りしたの
I purposefully took the long way around

30
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:27,568
少しでも長く君の隣にいたくて
Because I wanted to be by your side
for just a little longer

31
00:08:27,568 --> 00:08:33,468
私はおどけて「間違えた」って言った
I joked around and said I took the wrong turn

32
00:08:33,468 --> 00:08:40,408
君は笑う その顔がまぶしくて目をそらした
You laughed, and your face was so radiant
that I looked away

33
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:46,428
言葉じゃうまく言えない想い
These feelings I can't put into words well

34
00:08:46,428 --> 00:08:51,848
胸に抱いてこの道を歩いた
Carrying them in my heart, I walked this road

35
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:56,548
覚えてる あの時君は
I remember... at that time, you

36
00:08:56,548 --> 00:09:02,048
私の名前を呼んでくれた
Called my name

37
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:10,568
二人 夕暮れの帰り道で 忘れないよ さよならメモリーズ
On the road home at dusk, just the two of us
I'll never forget. Farewell memories

38
00:09:10,568 --> 00:09:16,488
出会えたこと 感謝してる
I'm grateful that we met

39
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:21,848
初めて見た 満開のサクラ
The full-blown cherry blossoms
I saw for the first time

40
00:09:22,588 --> 00:09:34,508
あれからどれくらい変われたんだろう
I wonder how much I've changed since then

41
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,566
櫻並木のあの人のこと好きになりそうで
I think I'm starting to fall for that person under the cherry blossoms

42
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:07,116
なんでかな わかんないよ
I don't know why, I just don't know

43
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:15,566
それからの毎日はとても楽しくてだけど同じくらいに
Every day since then has been so much fun, but at the same time

44
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:21,066
つらかったんだ
It's been just as painful

45
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:24,966
ごめんね なんかうまく言えないよ
I'm sorry, I can't seem to say it right

46
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:28,166
だから私 君となんていうか
So I... with you, how should I put it

47
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:30,516
今のまま
As things are now...

48
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:34,516
サヨナラしたくないの
I don't want to say goodbye

49
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:38,516
友達のままじゃ
Staying just as friends...

50
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:43,116
もういやなの
...I don't want that anymore

51
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,766
言おうと思ってた
I've been meaning to tell you

52
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,516
私 君の
That I... of you...

53
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:54,016
君のことずっと ずっと
That I've always, always...

54
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:59,516
前から
...from a long time ago

55
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:06,016
好きでした
Loved you

56
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:18,166
やっと言えた
I finally said it

57
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,216

Yeah!

100
00:16:11,224 --> 00:16:13,724

Woo!

107
00:16:27,424 --> 00:16:30,124
あいつもこいつもあの席を
Everyone's eyeing that seat

108
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,224
ただひとつねらっているんだよ
Aiming for that one spot

109
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:36,524
このクラスで一番の美人の隣を
Next to the prettiest girl in class

110
00:16:37,324 --> 00:16:40,224
ああ みんなライバルさ
Ah, everyone's a rival

111
00:16:40,424 --> 00:16:42,224
ライバルさ
Rival

112
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:45,124
ああ 命がけだよ
Ah, I'll bet my life

113
00:16:45,324 --> 00:16:47,824
イェイ イェイ イェイ
Yay yay yay

114
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:52,524
運命の女神さまよ
Goddess of fate

115
00:16:53,624 --> 00:16:57,424
このぼくにほほえんで一度だけでも
Smile at me, even if just once

116
00:16:57,624 --> 00:16:59,624
Wow wow wow...

117
00:16:59,824 --> 00:17:02,624
勉強する気もしない気も
No motivation to study

118
00:17:02,824 --> 00:17:04,924
この時にかかっているんだよ
It all depends on this moment

119
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,824
もしだめならこのぼくは
If it's no good, then I'll...

120
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:10,524
もうぐれてしまうよ
Go astray

121
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:17,124
Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey

122
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:19,824

00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:30,324
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

127
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:30,224
Woo!

128
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:48,824
二枚目気どりの秀才や
The guy acting cool

129
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:51,124
あのいやな悪党番長も
And that annoying bully leader

130
00:17:51,324 --> 00:17:53,724
胸はずませ待っている
With hearts racing, they wait

131
00:17:53,924 --> 00:17:55,824
どの席になるか
To see which seat they get

132
00:17:56,124 --> 00:17:59,124
ああ あの横顔
Ah, that profile

133
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:01,124
横顔
Profile

134
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:04,024
ああ みつめられたら
Ah, if she looks at me

135
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:06,824
イェイ イェイ イェイ
Yay yay yay

136
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:12,524
授業中は天国だよ
During class, it's heaven

137
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:17,524
このぼくに幸せをあたえておくれ
Please grant me happiness

138
00:18:18,924 --> 00:18:21,624
勉強する気もしない気も
No motivation to study

139
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:23,824
この時にかかっているんだよ
It all depends on this moment

140
00:18:24,024 --> 00:18:26,824
もしだめならこのぼくは
If it's no good, then I'll...

141
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:30,524
もうぐれてしまうよ
Go astray

142
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:35,324
Hey!

143
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:54,424
世界は恋に落ちている
The world is falling in love

144
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:58,524
光の矢胸を射す
An arrow of light pierces my heart

145
00:18:58,724 --> 00:19:01,924
君をわかりたいんだよ
I want to understand you

146
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:05,524
ねえ 教えて
Hey, tell me

147
00:19:21,124 --> 00:19:26,324
すれ違う言葉にちょっとだけの後悔
Regretting the words that missed each other

148
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:28,224
涙こぼれて
Tears overflow

149
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:35,124
忙しい感情鼓動にリンクする
Busy emotions link to my heartbeat

150
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:42,724
チューニング確かめたいんだ
I want to check our tuning

151
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:47,124
目的ばかりにとらわれて
Being caught up only in the goal

152
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:50,624
大事なものが霞んで逃げて
Important things blur and escape

153
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:57,824
今日もリスタート
Restarting again today

154
00:19:58,024 --> 00:20:00,024
世界は恋に落ちている
The world is falling in love

155
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,832
落ちている
...is falling in love.

156
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:04,832
光の矢胸を射す
An arrow of light pierces my chest.

157
00:20:04,832 --> 00:20:08,532
全部わかりたいんだよ
I want to understand everything.

158
00:20:08,532 --> 00:20:10,532
ねえ
Hey...

159
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:12,732
聞かせて
Tell me.

160
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:16,432
たった1ミリが遠くて
Even just one millimeter feels so far.

161
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:19,432
駆け抜けた日々に
In the days I've run through.

162
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:23,732
忘れない 忘れられない
I won't forget, I can't forget.

163
00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:27,532
輝く1ページ
This one shining page.

164
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:47,132
お似合いの二人に なんだか複雑な
Looking at the perfect couple, I feel complicated.

165
00:20:47,132 --> 00:20:49,832
気持ちがいるよ
These feelings are here.

166
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:54,432
初めての感情 鼓動にリンクする
This first-time emotion links to my heartbeat.

167
00:20:54,832 --> 00:21:00,032
体温計 壊れちゃったかな?
I wonder if the thermometer broke?

168
00:21:04,532 --> 00:21:08,232
自分のことわからないまま
Without even understanding myself.

169
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:12,432
あの子にアドバイスまでしちゃって
I even ended up giving advice to that girl.

170
00:21:12,432 --> 00:21:15,532
胸が痛いや
My chest hurts.

171
00:21:17,032 --> 00:21:21,032
世界は恋に落ちている
The world is falling in love.

172
00:21:21,032 --> 00:21:24,832
光の矢胸を射す
An arrow of light pierces my chest.

173
00:21:24,832 --> 00:21:29,532
気付いたこの想いは もう遅いの
Is it already too late for these feelings I've realized?

174
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:36,532
あの子のほうが可愛いの 知ってるよ だけど
I know she's cuter than me, but...

175
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:43,332
うまくいくななんてね
Hoping things don't go well for them...

176
00:21:43,332 --> 00:21:46,532
逃げ出したいくせに
Even though I want to run away.

177
00:21:46,632 --> 00:21:47,332
バカ。
Stupid.

178
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:49,832
君のこと全部わかりたいって思っちゃう
I end up thinking I want to understand everything about you.

179
00:21:49,832 --> 00:21:52,332
これが恋だって初めて気付いたの
I realized for the first time that this is love.

180
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:54,432
絶対 振り向いてほしい
I definitely want you to look my way.

181
00:21:54,432 --> 00:21:57,132
遅かったけど諦めたくない
It's late, but I don't want to give up.

182
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,632
だって 好きだから
Because... I love you.

183
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:04,232
本当に 咲いた 花が 恋をした
A flower that truly bloomed fell in love.

184
00:22:07,432 --> 00:22:14,332
花は 必死に 上を向いて 笑った
The flower desperately looked up and smiled.

185
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:19,432
青い 夏の 蕾も 恋をした
The blue summer bud also fell in love.

186
00:22:22,032 --> 00:22:27,532
咲かない 花と 火薬の 匂い
The flower that won't bloom and the smell of gunpowder.

187
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:47,832
本当の気持ち 言葉にして
Putting my true feelings into words.

188
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:51,332
大事なこと話せたら
If I could talk about what's important.

189
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:55,832
今日もリスタート
Starting over again today.

190
00:22:58,832 --> 00:23:03,232
どんだけ鈍い君だから 口に出して言わなきゃ
Since you're so dense, I have to say it out loud.

191
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:11,232
今君に伝えるよ ねえ 好きです
I'm telling you right now. Hey, I love you.

192
00:23:13,832 --> 00:23:17,832
世界は恋に落ちている
The world is falling in love.

193
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:21,432
光の矢胸を射す
An arrow of light pierces my chest.

194
00:23:21,432 --> 00:23:26,332
全部わかりたいんだよ ねえ
I want to understand everything, hey.

195
00:23:26,332 --> 00:23:28,832
聞かせて
Tell me.

196
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:32,432
たぐり寄せて 0センチ
Pulling it closer, zero centimeters.

197
00:23:32,432 --> 00:23:35,832
駆け抜けた日々に
In the days I've run through.

198
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:39,732
忘れない 忘れられない
I won't forget, I can't forget.

199
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:43,532

This one shining page.

00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:26,032
ハッピープレゼント
Happy Present

201
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:30,232
黒板そっぽ向いて
Facing away from the blackboard.

202
00:24:30,232 --> 00:24:33,732
ちらり見つめる先は
The destination of my sidelong glances is...

203
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:37,032
甘い横顔ファンタジー
...the fantasy of your sweet profile.

204
00:24:38,532 --> 00:24:42,132
突然校舎裏
Suddenly behind the school building.

205
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:46,032
そうだ恋愛モード
That's right, romance mode.

206
00:24:46,032 --> 00:24:49,832
やっぱ私じゃない
As I thought, it's not me.

207
00:24:49,832 --> 00:24:52,565
だけどあなた...
But you...

208
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:05,040
ハッピー・プレゼント
Happy Present

209
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,171
健気に頑張る
Working hard with all my heart

210
00:25:02,171 --> 00:25:03,538
いつの日か
That one day...

211
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:06,706
振り向かせてみせるわ
I'll make you turn around and look at me!

212
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,340
鈍感すぎなのよ　御身さん
You're just too dense, you!

213
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,340
Happy Happy Happy Present

It's only you, my eternal "once"

217
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,340

219
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
いつか終わるの？
Will it end someday?

220
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,240
ねぇ　抱きしめてほしい
Hey, I want you to hold me

221
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,040
片想い
Unrequited love

222
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,340
まとめて　ため息色
All together, the color of a sigh

223
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,840
不意に見つめる先に
Suddenly, where you're looking...

224
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:54,040
暗い横顔　ミステリアス
...your dark profile is mysterious

225
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,640
走る渡り廊下
Running through the connecting corridor

226
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,640
背中押す　全力モード
Pushing your back, in full-power mode

227
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,040
もしかして　振られたの？
Could it be that you got dumped?

228
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,140
元気出してよ
Cheer up!

229
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,240
私がいるよ
I'm here for you!

230
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,840
告白だよ　でも気づいてない顔
It's a confession, but you're not noticing

231
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,140
鈍感すぎよ　御身さん
You're just too dense, you!

232

Heart-throbbing Happy Present

233
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,140

235
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,840

It's playing a melody of love

236
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,140
ときめきHappy Present
Heart-throbbing Happy Present

237
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,140
あなたに全部捧げる I want you
I'll give you everything, I want you

238
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,040
いつになるだろう？
When will it be?

239
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,340
ねぇ　終わらせたいよ
Hey, I want to end it

240
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,340
片想い
Unrequited love

241
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,040
花の塔
Tower of Flower

242
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,340
君が持ってきた漫画
The manga you brought over

243
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,040
くれた知らない名前のお花
The flower with the name I didn't know that you gave me

244
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,040
今日はまだ来ないかな
I wonder if you won't come today either

245
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,540
初めての感情知ってしまった
I've come to know a feeling for the first time

246
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,540
窓に飾った絵画をなぞって
Tracing the painting decorated on the window

247
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,540
一人で宇宙を旅して
Traveling through space all by myself

248
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:53,040
それだけでいいはずだったのに
That should have been enough, and yet...

249
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,340
君の手を握ってしまったら
If I were to end up holding your hand

250
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,040
孤独を知らないこの街には
In this town that doesn't know loneliness...

251
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:10,540
もう二度と帰ってくることはできないのでしょう
...I probably won't be able to return ever again

252
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,540
君が手を差し伸べた
You reached out your hand

253
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,540
光で影が生まれる
Shadows are born from the light

254
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,840
歌って聴かせて
Sing it for me

255
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,040
この話の続き
The rest of this story

256
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:36,540
連れて行って見たことない星まで
Take me away, to a star I've never seen before

257
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,040
誰の手の声も届かない
Where no one's hands or voices can reach

258
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,340
高くそびえ立った塔の上
Atop the tower that stands tall

259
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,840
飛ばす風船　風連れ
Letting balloons fly, carried by the wind

260
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,348
僕を君に
For you...

261
00:30:01,348 --> 00:30:03,548
まだ笑ってほしいんだ
...I want you to keep smiling.

262
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,067
満たされない穴は
The unfilled holes in my heart

263
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:16,868
脱線の会話や
Were filled by derailed conversations

264
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:19,510
澄ましたポーズで
And straight-faced poses

265
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:23,286
これまでは埋めてきたけど
That's how I've survived until now

266
00:30:23,527 --> 00:30:27,550
退屈な日々を蹴飛ばして
Kicking away those boring days

267
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:31,476
君と二人で
Just the two of us

268
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:34,243
この街中を
Through this whole city

269
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,110
泳げたらそれはどれだけ
If we could swim, how much...

270
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:44,389
素敵なことでしょう？
...wonderful that would be?

271
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:50,206
出したことないほど大きな
With a voice louder than ever before

272
00:30:50,206 --> 00:30:54,721
声でやっと君に伝わる
It'll finally reach you

273
00:30:56,328 --> 00:31:02,094
歪な声がきっとちょうどいいさ
This distorted voice is surely just right

274
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:08,625
世界の端と端を結んで
Connecting the ends of the world

275
00:31:19,913 --> 00:31:23,128
窓に飾った絵画をなぞって
Tracing the paintings on the window

276
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:26,589
一人で宇宙を旅して
Traveling the universe all alone

277
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:31,066
それだけでも不自由ないけど
I had no complaints about that, but...

278
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:34,598
僕は選んでみたいのさ
I want to try choosing

279
00:31:34,598 --> 00:31:38,048
逆様な心の空を
The sky of an inverted heart

280
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:41,548
安全なループを今、
This safe loop, right now,

281
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:44,548
書き換えて！
Rewrite it!

282
00:31:46,116 --> 00:31:50,632
君の手を握りしめたら
Once I hold your hand tight

283
00:31:50,632 --> 00:31:55,132
孤独を知らないこの街には
To this city that knows no loneliness

284
00:31:55,132 --> 00:32:00,218
もう二度と帰ってくることはできないのでしょう
We probably won't be able to return ever again

285
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:13,566
いくらでも迷いながら
Even if we get lost as many times as it takes

286
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,647
光も影も見に行こう
Let's go see both the light and the shadows

287
00:32:19,091 --> 00:32:23,136
歌って聞かせてこの話の続き
Sing to me the rest of this story

288
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:30,124
連れて行って見たことない星まで
Take me to stars I've never seen before

289
00:32:36,616 --> 00:32:44,068
世界の端と端を結んで
Connecting the ends of the world

290
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:09,548
つっぱることが男の
Being a rebel is a man's...

291
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:12,848
たった一つの勲章だって
...only true badge of honor

292
00:33:12,848 --> 00:33:17,348
この胸に信じて生きてきた
That's what I've believed in all my life

293
00:33:17,348 --> 00:33:22,548
泣きたくなるようなつらい時もあるけど
There are times so painful I want to cry

294
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:28,048
いつも俺達がんばってきた
But we've always kept on fighting

295
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:33,848
時の重さに流されそうになった時らも
Even when the weight of time tried to sweep us away

296
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:38,848
歯をくいしばりたえてきた
We gritted our teeth and endured

297
00:33:39,048 --> 00:33:43,048
ガキの頃路地裏で見た
In the back alleys of our youth

298
00:33:43,048 --> 00:33:48,548
夜空にキラめいていた
Sparkling in the night sky

299
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:55,048
流れる星を見て
Looking up at the shooting stars

300
00:33:55,548 --> 00:34:00,048
誓った思いを忘れちゃいないぜ
I haven't forgotten the oath I made

301
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:03,048
つっぱることが男の
Being a rebel is a man's...

302
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:06,548
たった一つの勲章だって
...only true badge of honor

303
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:11,048
この胸に信じて生きてきた
That's what I've believed in all my life

304
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:34,048
氷のように冷たい世間の壁が
The cold, ice-like walls of society

305
00:34:34,048 --> 00:34:39,548
いつもさえぎる俺たちの前を
Are always blocking our path

306
00:34:39,548 --> 00:34:44,548
胸にえがいたこの夢はハンパじゃないから
Because this dream in my heart is no half-measure

307
00:34:44,548 --> 00:34:50,048
かじかむこの手握りしめ
Grasping these numbing hands tight

獲物は...
The prey is...

466
00:47:10,492 --> 00:47:12,222
君だよ！
You!

467
00:47:13,522 --> 00:47:16,022
Cutie Panther 君の
Cutie Panther, your

468
00:47:16,092 --> 00:47:18,622
瞳が欲しい
Eyes, I want them

Surely steal them

471
00:47:24,522 --> 00:47:27,022

瞳が欲しい

私 きっと
I'll surely

474

素早く逃がさない
Quickly not let you escape

475
00:48:04,222 --> 00:48:05,822
何度も言わせるつもりなの？
How many times do I have to say it?

476
00:48:05,892 --> 00:48:07,222
あおやあおや
Oh my, oh my

477
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:08,822
抵抗するなしでごらん
Try not to resist

478
00:48:08,892 --> 00:48:10,222
はいはいはい
Yes, yes, yes

479
00:48:10,292 --> 00:48:13,022
我がままだと知ってるけれど
I know I'm selfish

480
00:48:13,092 --> 00:48:15,422
私の方が上手なようね
But it seems I'm the superior one

481
00:48:15,922 --> 00:48:17,122
冷たい言葉
Cold words

482
00:48:17,192 --> 00:48:18,722
優しい視線
A gentle gaze

483
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:20,122
獲物は...
The prey is...

484

心を離さない
I won't let your heart go

493
00:48:50,222 --> 00:48:51,422
どこにいるの？
Where are you?

494
00:48:51,492 --> 00:48:52,822
ムリよムリよ
It's no use, no use

495
00:48:52,892 --> 00:48:54,722
どこにいたってムリよ
Wherever you are, it's no use

496
00:48:55,222 --> 00:48:56,322
捕まえちゃう！
I'll catch you!

497
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:57,922
だれといるの？
Who are you with?

498
00:48:57,992 --> 00:48:59,322
ダメよダメよ
No, no

499
00:48:59,392 --> 00:49:01,122
私以外はダメよ
Anyone but me is no good

500
00:49:01,622 --> 00:49:02,822
どこにいるの？
Where are you?

501
00:49:02,892 --> 00:49:04,222
ムリよムリよ
It's no use, no use

502
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:06,122
どこにいたってムリよ
Wherever you are, it's no use

503
00:49:06,622 --> 00:49:07,722
捕まえちゃう！
I'll catch you!

504
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:09,322
だれといるの？
Who are you with?

505
00:49:09,392 --> 00:49:10,722

506
00:49:10,792 --> 00:49:12,522

508
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,080
明日、今日よりも好きになれる
Tomorrow, I'll love you even more than today

509
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:10,580
溢れる想いが止まらない
These overflowing feelings won't stop

510
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,280
今もこんなに好きでいるのに
Even though I love you this much right now

511
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,580
言葉に出来ない
I can't put it into words

512
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:27,580
君のくれた日々が積み重なり
The days you gave me piled up

513
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,080
過ぎ去った日々 2人歩いた『軌跡』
The days that passed, the 'path' we two walked

514
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,580
僕らの出逢いがもし偶然ならば?
If our meeting was just a coincidence?

515
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,080
運命ならば? 君に巡り合えた それって『奇跡』
If it was fate? That I could meet you, that's a 'miracle'

516
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,580
2人寄り添って歩いて 永久の愛を形にして
Walking close together, giving form to eternal love

517
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:53,580
いつまでも君の横で 笑っていたくて
I want to be laughing by your side forever

518
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,280
アリガトウや Ah 愛してるじゃまだ
Saying 'Thank you' or 'I love you' is still...

519
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,580
足りないけどせめて言わせて 「幸せです」と
...not enough, but at least let me say, "I'm happy"

520
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:10,080
いつも君の右の手のひらを
Always, your right palm...

521
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:15,080
ただ僕の左の手のひらが
...is just held by my left palm

522
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,580
そっと包んでくそれだけで
Just by gently wrapping around it

523
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,580
ただ愛を感じていた
I felt nothing but love

524
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:31,080
日々の中で 小さな幸せ
In the middle of our days, small bits of happiness

525
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:36,080
見つけ重ね ゆっくり歩いた『軌跡』
Finding and piling them up, the 'path' we walked slowly

526
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,580
僕らの出逢いは大きな世界で
Our meeting, in this big world

527
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:47,080
小さな出来事 巡り合えた それって『奇跡』
Is a small event, but meeting you, that's a 'miracle'

528
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:52,580
うまく行かない日だって 2人で居れば晴れだって
Even on days when things don't go well, if we're together it's sunny

529
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,580
強がりや寂しさも 忘れられるから
Because I can forget my bluffing and loneliness

530
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:02,580
僕は君でなら 僕でいれるから!
Because if it's you, I can be myself!

531
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:08,580
だからいつもそばに居てよ 『愛しい君へ』
So please stay by my side always, 'to my beloved'

532
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,580
2人ふざけあった帰り道
On the way home when the two of us were fooling around

533
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,580
それも大切な僕らの日々
Those too are our precious days

534
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,580
「想いよ届け!!!」と伝えた時に
When I said, "Let my feelings reach you!!!"

535
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:29,080
初めて見せた表情の君
The expression you showed for the first time

536
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:34,080
少し間が空いて 君がうなずいて
A small silence, then you nodded

537
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:39,080
僕らの心 満たされてく愛で
Our hearts were being filled with love

538
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:44,080
僕らまだ旅の途中で
We're still in the middle of our journey

539
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:49,080
またこれから先も何十年
And for decades to come

540
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:54,080
続いていけるような未来へ
Towards a future that can continue

541
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,580
2人寄り添って歩いて 永久の愛を形にして
Walking close together, giving form to eternal love

542
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,080
いつまでも君の横で 笑っていたくて
I want to be laughing by your side forever

543
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:05,580
アリガトウや Ah 愛してるじゃまだ
Saying 'Thank you' or 'I love you' is still...

544
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:11,580
足りないけどせめて言わせて 「幸せです」と
...not enough, but at least let me say, "I'm happy"

545
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:17,080
うまく行かない日だって 2人で居れば晴れだって
Even on days when things don't go well, if we're together it's sunny

546
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:22,080
喜びや悲しみも 全て分け合える
We can share all the joy and sadness

547
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,080
君が居るから 生きていけるから!
Because you're here, because I can keep living!

548
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:33,080
だからいつもそばに居てよ 『愛しい君へ』
So please stay by my side always, 'to my beloved'

549
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:41,580
最後の一秒まで
Until the very last second

550
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,580
明日、今日より笑顔になれる
Tomorrow, I can smile even more than today

551
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:57,580
君が居るだけで そう思えるから
Just because you're here, I can think so

552
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:03,580
何十年 何百年 何千年 時を越えよう
For decades, centuries, millennia, let's cross time

553
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:09,080
君を愛してる
I love you
