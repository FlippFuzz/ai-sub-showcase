2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,400
Hello, welcome to my 3D live!

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,300
Mini 3D live, actually!

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,700
Happy two years!

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,400
I kind of want to go somewhere really nice.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,700
Look at the sky.

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,800
Look at how beautiful the weather is.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,400
I wouldn't call this weather.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,700
Look at this beautiful weather.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,100
I want to—I want to go somewhere nice.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,300
Where should I go?

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,600
Oh!

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,300
What's there? Wait.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,900
Let me get—let me get closer.

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,000
Huh?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,700
Ah!

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,500
Ah! It's a heli!

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,900
It's a heli! We have a helicopter!

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,300
Wait.

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,400
Wait, I want to—I want to—

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,800
I want to ride a heli!

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,500
This is like my 3D showcase, actually.

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,300
I remember that I rode a heli once.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,800
Whoa!

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,200
We're actually flying!

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,900
Wait, what?

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,500
We're actually flying!

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh my god, we're flying!

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,400
We're flying!

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,200
え、すごい！
Eh, amazing!

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,000
え、we're flying, chat! Whoa!
Eh, we're flying, chat! Whoa!

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,300
Let me get out of here.

33
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,300
I can't get out of here.

34
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Wait, now I can.

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Oh! Whoa! Bye-bye!

36
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,200
Bye-bye, heli!

37
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,700
Whoa, that was so cool.

38
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,500
Yeah, and that's a grand entrance, isn't it?

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,300
Be-fitting for me, the best agent in the world.

40
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,400
Huh?

41
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,200
What are you looking at?

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,800
What are you looking at?

43
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,000
You're late to your mission, Zekataries!

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,800
I know you're so—

45
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,700
You were supposed to be waiting for me at the stage.

46
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,100
And now, to do your mission!

47
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,700
And to greet me once I get off the helicopter.

48
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,400
But now what are you doing?

49
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,500
You're doing nothing but waving a light stick!

50
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,500
Is this what you were born to do?

51
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,400
I'm so aggressive.

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Wait, watch this, watch this, okay? Watch this.

53
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,400
Whoo! Guess who's here!

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,700
Zekataries!

55
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,100
Oh!

56
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,800
Hello! Hello!

57
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,600
Why don't you guys say something? Hello! Hello!

58
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,700
You guys are lifeless.

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
I'm the same.

60
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,300
Sometimes I feel lifeless too.

61
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,800
Okay, what about—

62
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,100
What about—what about this part?

63
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,100
Watch this.

64
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,000
Whoo! Isn't the stage beautiful?

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,600
I was going to show—show you out the stage earlier, but I forgot.

66
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,500
I have two-second memory, so...

67
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,800
Look at the beautiful skies.

68
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,800
I wanted something like, um, really magical.

69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,300
Something like starry night, langit...
Something like starry night, the sky...

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,400
Enggak tahu, langit.
I don't know, the sky.

71
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,700
Like anything related to gastronomy—wait, astronomy!

72
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
Astronomy! Not gastronomy.

73
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,800
That's stomach, holy crap.

74
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,000
Astronomy. Look!

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,300
There's a shooting star!

76
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,400
There's a shooting star! Make a wish.

77
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,800
Make a wish.

78
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,400
What did you make a wish?

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,800
You guys have to make a wish.

80
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,500
Oh! What do you think about this one?

81
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,200
Do you know what it says there?

82
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,000
Can you find something? Can you guys tell me what it says?

83
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,300
Yes!

84
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,600
It—it says Zeta on the stage.

85
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,300
You know, because...

86
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,700
Zeta is—Zeta is the best thing that could ever, ever happen—

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,300
What's wrong with my speech?

88
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,100
...that could ever happen in your life.

89
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,500
Oh, wait, look at this one.

90
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,700
Are you guys ready? Sorry.

91
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,300
I was like trying to talk while I maneuver through this thing.

92
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
I'm very new to VR, so...

93
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,500
This is very, very difficult for me.

94
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,500
I am entering a whole new world, you know?

95
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,700
But yeah!

96
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,400
I was thinking, since it's our two-year anniversary...

97
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,700
...on this channel, I was thinking why not celebrate...

98
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
...me being two years old?

99
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,500
I'm just kidding, so young.

100
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,300
Me being—

101
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
I wouldn't say—

102
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,700
If I've been streaming for two years,

103
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,300
does that mean I'm old now?

104
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,200
Like, is two years old old?

105
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,000
Like, hello?

106
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:04,799
Oh! Hello, I'm back chat.

107
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:07,433
I know you missed my face. I know you missed my face.

108
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:10,033
And I was like, you guys are probably like...

109
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:11,866
"Where's Zeta? I don't want to see the stage", like...

110
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:13,299
How dare you!

111
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:14,766
How dare you!

112
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,866
Huh? Huh?

113
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:19,466
This stage was made with lots of love and care.

114
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,466
How dare you not want to see the stage.

115
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:24,399
Anyways... I'll show you around.

116
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,799
As you guys can see, you are in the back...

117
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:30,966
...waving... waving that lightstick...

118
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:34,233
...with no single thought in your head.

119
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,599
Just like me.

120
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:40,099
If you want to get closer, you might notice that I have no single thought.

121
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:43,799
Oh, I look like I have a mohawk here.

122
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,399
Jamet banget.
So tacky.

123
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,366
Jamet banget kalau kayak gini.
It looks so tacky if it's like this.

124
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:49,066
Anjay!
Holy cow!

125
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:53,066
Whoo! Okay, I'm not used to holding a selfie stick, so if...

126
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:57,999
...if it... oh! Well, if it gets turned around, then I'm sorry.

127
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:03,566
Well, I have a bunch of things that I wanted to show you. Watch this, okay?

128
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:13,899
(Humming)

129
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,899
Wait... whoa!

130
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:20,566
Wait... (laughs)

131
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:27,099
You probably... you probably didn't know what just happened.

132
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:31,099
Ah, I'm tired. I want to lie down.

133
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:37,966
I want to lie down.

134
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:42,166
Okay, break time's over.

135
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:47,366
Okay, watch this. I have...

136
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:52,966
Bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa... bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa...

137
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:56,566
Watch this. Chipi chipi chapa chapa...

138
00:06:56,566 --> 00:07:00,633
I've always wanted to rap in this stage made just for me, you know?

139
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:04,233
I thought it would be cool. I'm just like, "yeah".

140
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:07,299
Yo, yo, yo, mic check one, two.

141
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:10,533
I'm the next rapper in town. What was my rapper name again?

142
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:15,233
DJ... DJ V-V-V... DJ V-7 or something?

143
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:19,466
I don't remember to be honest.

144
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:24,066
Damn, I have a two-second memory like a goldfish.

145
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:27,499
Oh, wait! With a mic too! I should have done it with a mic.

146
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:29,666
Yo, yo, yo! Yo, yo, yo!

147
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,433
Watch me... watch me hit you with this mic!

148
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:35,866
(Hitting noises)

149
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:39,966
(Hitting noises)

150
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:44,233
Oh... this might be a little bit more tame.

151
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:48,366
I won't... I won't hit you anymore, okay? I won't hit you anymore.

152
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:50,566
Ready for the surprise? Ready for the surprise?

153
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:57,599
I won't hit you anymore.

154
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,533
One evil thought.

155
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:04,299
It's a cat! What do you think?

156
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:08,566
(Humming "Cat Dance" tune)

157
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:13,499
How does the cat dance go again?

158
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:16,899
(Humming)

159
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:19,499
Yeah, it's a cat! Do you like it?

160
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,733
I'm going to do a 360 for you. 360 no scope. Bye-bye!

161
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:26,533
Spin!

162
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:29,599
Wait, I can actually do spinning in real time now. Wait.

163
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,666
Spin!

164
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,766
Wait, I can... oh, I'm so dizzy. I'm so motion sick.

165
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,233
Thank you very much, I'm so motion sick.

166
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:40,433
Why did you do that to me? Why did you make me motion sick?

167
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:44,833
You know that I'm prone to motion sickness! Why did you do...?

168
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:51,366
This is probably the most motion sick inducing VR concert...

169
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:54,099
Not... Okay, I should stop calling it a concert.

170
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:57,633
It's not a concert. It's more like a fun free talk, zatsu, you know? Zatsu?

171
00:08:57,633 --> 00:09:02,433
Like a fun segment. So, free talk? I would consider it free talk.

172
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:06,599
We are doing a lot of free talking here and a lot of...

173
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:10,566
...camera smashing, motion sick inducing stuff.

174
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:13,833
Would you like to keep me...

175
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:18,199
Would you like for me to keep the cat ears on or not?

176
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:22,599
Because I feel like you guys would appreciate my hair more.

177
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:26,866
Since my hair already looks like the ears anyway, so I don't think we need it.

178
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:31,533
We don't need it.

179
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:35,899
Look, pretty much the same.

180
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:40,133
Okay, oh no! I literally just admitted... No, it's not the same.

181
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:43,799
That's hair, okay? Shut up, furries.

182
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:47,366
This is hair. You can't just equate anything remotely...

183
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:51,799
...hair-like to animals.

184
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,099
I have a guest!

185
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:58,299
I have a guest on this special anniversary stream, and that is...

186
00:10:00,045 --> 00:15:00,045
#2ETAnniv

187
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:05,145
Bazo!

188
00:10:05,245 --> 00:10:06,545
What do you think?

189
00:10:06,645 --> 00:10:07,845
Is it cute?

190
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:10,045
Pretty cute, right?

191
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:14,545
Pwa pwa pwa... pwa pwa pwa pwa.

192
00:10:14,645 --> 00:10:17,045
So cute. Wait, if I...

193
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:20,045
if I bend over, maybe you'll be able to see better.

194
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:24,045
This is Bazo. Isn't he so cute?

195
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:25,545
Wait, come closer.

196
00:10:26,745 --> 00:10:28,145
Wait, that's not me.

197
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:30,345
What the?

198
00:10:30,345 --> 00:10:32,445
This one, this way?

199
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:36,045
Yeah. What you doing, baby girl?

200
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:41,045
Yeah, this is Bazo. Very cute.

201
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:43,645
I know you guys love Bazo more than me sometimes.

202
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,345
Um, what else, what else?

203
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:51,045
Oh, I have my usual emote.

204
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:53,045
If you remember, type this in chat.

205
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:58,245
My usual emote. Wait, watch this. Hehehe...

206
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:03,445
Hehehe. It's the :w:, :w:. My usual emote.

207
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:10,545
Um, I have a really sad, sad emote as well.
Watch this.

208
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:13,545
Watch this, okay?

209
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:17,345
Prep- be prepared to be sad, everyone.

210
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,545
Be prepared to... be prepared to sad.

211
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:23,945
What is wrong with my English today?

212
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:27,245
Siap-siap nangis. Lihat ini, oke?
Get ready to cry. Look at this, okay?

213
00:11:30,145 --> 00:11:43,845
Uwaaa... uwaaa...

214
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:47,045
It's such a tragic day today.

215
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:49,045
Zeta turned 2 years old.

216
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:53,545
Two today...

217
00:11:56,545 --> 00:12:00,645
Wait, watch this. I can go even sadder.

218
00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:07,545
Uwaaa... Please! No!

219
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:11,545
Don't take my...

220
00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:15,545
don't take my... what is it called?

221
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:19,445
Don't take my expired food away. No!

222
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:24,245
Don't take my coffee away.

223
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,845
What about this? Hmm... what do you guys think?

224
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:33,845
Tu tu ru tu ru tu ru...

225
00:12:35,445 --> 00:12:36,545
Hah!

226
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:40,445
Hah! You eat veggies?

227
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:45,345
You are so disgusting! Just kidding.

228
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:48,045
And this one...

229
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:51,645
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

230
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:54,545
The thing is, with...

231
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:57,645
with this chibi body, I can't really like...
my movement is very limited.

232
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:04,145
But, you know, I can still move around
and have fun with you guys.

233
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:08,045
So I don't think that's too much
of a problem, you know?

234
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:14,245
Hehehe! Hehehe! This is a happy, happy one.

235
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:16,145
But watch this.

236
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:19,645
へっ？なんでそんなことできるの？
Heh? How can you do that?

237
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:23,245
なんでそんなことできないの？はっ？
Why can't you do that? Huh?

238
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:27,845
Why can't you even do that?
That's just such a simple thing.

239
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:30,345
Why can't you just wash the dishes?

240
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:35,345
This is smug. This is smug Gaki Zeta.

241
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:40,545
Sorry, I keep hitting the mic,
you're probably gonna die.

242
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:44,245
Um, yeah, this is Gaki Zeta, you know?

243
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:47,345
I think you guys might like Gaki Zeta.

244
00:13:47,545 --> 00:13:52,545
Hmm... Wait, give me one second.

245
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:57,045
Okay, I had to adjust the mic a little bit, but...

246
00:13:57,645 --> 00:13:58,745
Watch this.

247
00:13:58,745 --> 00:14:02,545
Whoo! キラキラ！キラキラ！
Whoo! Sparkle sparkle! Sparkle sparkle!

248
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:10,545
And this one.

249
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:13,545
You guys already seen this one, but...

250
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:16,545
me when I don't get my daily intake of coffee.

251
00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:21,245
Hah! Where's my caffeine?

252
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:25,045
Okay, well... I am excited to show you guys

253
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:27,545
um, what we have in store today.

254
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:31,045
I was thinking we can do a little bit of free talk

255
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:33,845
and maybe some songs in between, you know?

256
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:35,645
You know, what do you guys think?

257
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:42,545
Um, I kind of want to like... um, I don't know,
I have no thoughts.

258
00:14:42,545 --> 00:14:46,045
I... the thing is I don't... I just...

259
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:50,445
the thing is I just don't think.

260
00:14:51,345 --> 00:14:54,545
I'm just gonna chill with you guys today

261
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:57,245
and do whatever feels best.

262
00:14:57,345 --> 00:15:00,045
If I... if I wanted to do a backflip, then I would...

263
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,471
What about this?

264
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,688
This is cute.

265
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:07,538
This one is cute.

266
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:08,588

267
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:10,188

Okay!

272
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:17,438

274
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:20,688
I will show you.

275
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:22,138
Ah...

276
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:23,788
Let's get back into position.

277
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:25,188
Okay, okay.

278
00:15:25,588 --> 00:15:27,238
Okay...

279
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:28,988
Let's get back into position.

00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:30,638
And...

281
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,538
I want you guys to have fun with me, okay?

282
00:15:32,538 --> 00:15:34,138
This is nothing serious,

283
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:36,488
so please, let's all just like have fun together, you know?

284
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,538
Have fun together.

285
00:15:40,538 --> 00:15:43,138
Enjoy these moments together.

286
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:44,388
And...

287
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:47,388
yeah, if you guys know the song, we can sing along,

288
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:49,938
but if you don't, that's fine too.

289
00:15:51,188 --> 00:15:52,538

293
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,188
You can just sit there and wave the lightsticks.

294
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:06,238

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,873
たとえ世界が私を拒んで
Even if the world rejects me...

339
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:19,440
一人ぼっちを感じたとしても
and I feel all alone...

340
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,240
あなたが味方でいてくれたら
if you're on my side...

341
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,540
怖いものはないよ
there's nothing to be afraid of!

342
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,907
見せよう
Let's show them!

343
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:44,273
見せよう
Let's show them!

344
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:46,040
今から始まる
Starting now,

345
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,407
君との物語が
the story between you and me!

346
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:51,873
なんて素晴らしい景色だ
What a wonderful sight!

347
00:18:52,373 --> 00:18:54,707
下界の悩みは関係ない
Worldly troubles don't matter!

348
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:57,907
箱が大きい小さいとか気にしない
I don't care if the venue is big or small!

349
00:18:57,907 --> 00:18:59,640
ちゃんと見えてる
I can clearly see

350
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:03,373
君のサイリウム
your lightstick!

351
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:05,840
今はボロボロバカみたいだろな
Right now I probably look like a total mess!

352
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,440
小さら小さい才能だけど
I only have a tiny bit of talent, but...

353
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,040
私を推してくれるのなら
if you support me...

354
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,440
あなたが味方でいてくれたら
if you're on my side...

355
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,373
極レスをあげる
I'll give you my best fan service!

356
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,140
あなたのアイドル
I'm your idol!

357
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,673
サインはB！
The sign is B!

358
00:19:25,673 --> 00:19:26,673
チュッ！
Mwah!

359
00:19:45,438 --> 00:19:46,788
Yay!

360
00:19:48,238 --> 00:19:49,338
How was it?

361
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:51,738
Did you wave your lightsticks around?

362
00:19:52,388 --> 00:19:53,438
Did you?

363
00:19:54,138 --> 00:19:57,438
I saw you in the audience and you weren't waving your lightsticks,

364
00:19:57,438 --> 00:19:58,788
you were...

365
00:19:58,788 --> 00:20:01,088
you were just staying still.

366
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,569
Losers. Just kidding.

367
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:08,569
Um, so next song, so next song is something, something you guys might really like.

368
00:20:09,569 --> 00:20:13,569
Hehehe. What do you think it is?

369
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:20,569
I wanted something really like groovy, really like slow,

370
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:26,569
cause lately I've been really into like, like sweet but like slow songs, you know?

371
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:32,569
Um... what if I bring a friend with me?

372
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:35,069
What do you guys think? Should I bring...

373
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:40,069
...should I bring a friend with me? (Struggling sounds) Hahaha!

374
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:42,569
I'm going to bring him along as well.

375
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:45,069
バゾのこと好き？
Do you like Bazo?

376
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:46,069
バゾ好き？
Do you like Bazo?

377
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:47,569
バゾ好き？ん？
Do you like Bazo? Hmm?

378
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:52,069
好きはダメだよ。
You can't like him.

379
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:54,069
You can't like Bazo. Bazo's mine.

380
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:56,569
He's my slave forever. You can't like him.

381
00:20:57,569 --> 00:21:00,569
Well, and on that note,

382
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:05,569
I have a song related to a person or someone that you can't like, okay?

383
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,569
So let's go!

384
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,069
Next song!

385
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,069
好きになっちゃダメな人
The person you shouldn't fall in love with

386
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,069
負けじゃん 勝てるわけないじゃん
I've lost already, haven't I? There's no way I can win

387
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:24,069
最初から分かってた
I knew it from the start

388
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:26,569
あなたは あなたは
That you are, you are

389
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:30,069
好きになっちゃダメな人
The person you shouldn't fall in love with

390
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:37,069
あなたの「好き」ってどんな「好き」？
What kind of 'like' is your 'like'?

391
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:39,569
多分私と違う「好き」
It's probably a different 'like' from mine

392
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:44,569
「可愛い」だなんて言葉でごまかさないで
Don't try to gloss it over with words like 'cute'

393
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:49,069
大事にされてること、は痛いほど分かるけれど
I know you treasure me, so much it hurts

394
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:52,069
何かが足りない 違う そうじゃない
Something's missing, it's different, that's not it

395
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:54,569
気持ちが死にたい mm-mm-mm
My feelings want to die, mm-mm-mm

396
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:57,569
私が大きくなったよ
I've grown up, you know

397
00:21:57,569 --> 00:22:00,069
背伸びしたら届きそうな
If I stretch on my tiptoes, I could almost reach

398
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:04,569
あなたの唇
Your lips

399
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:09,569
もう子供扱いしないでよ
Stop treating me like a child already

400
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:12,569
ほらまた頭くしゃって
See, you're ruffling my hair again

401
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:15,069
くしゃってする
Ruffling it like that

402
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:18,069
好きになっちゃダメな人
The person you shouldn't fall in love with

403
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:20,569
負けじゃん 勝てるわけないじゃん
I've lost already, haven't I? There's no way I can win

404
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:25,569
そのずるい笑顔に 飲み込まれてゆく
I'm being swallowed up by that unfair smile of yours

405
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:28,569
好きになっちゃダメな人
The person you shouldn't fall in love with

406
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:30,569
こんなのってないじゃん
This is so unfair, isn't it?

407
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:33,569
最初から分かってた
I knew it from the start

408
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:36,069
あなたは あなたは
That you are, you are

409
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:39,569
好きになっちゃダメな人
The person you shouldn't fall in love with

410
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:47,069
想いに気づくタイミングは
The times to realize my feelings

411
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:49,569
たくさんあったはずなのに
There must have been so many of them

412
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,569
私可愛くないほど 素直じゃない
I'm not honest enough to be cute

413
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:55,069
このまま消えたい mm-mm-mm
I just want to disappear like this, mm-mm-mm

414
00:22:56,069 --> 00:23:00,069
気持ちが膨れ上がるたび
Every time my feelings swell up

415
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:03,569
バレるのが悔しくて
It's frustrating that they'll be found out

416
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:06,069
隠した横顔
So I hide my profile

417
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:11,069
好きでいさせて 一人なの？
Let me keep loving you, am I all alone?

418
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:16,069
そうだと知ってしまって 涙が出る
Knowing that's the case makes the tears fall

419
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:19,569
好きにならないほうが無理じゃん
It's impossible not to fall for you, isn't it?

420
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:21,569
かなうわけないじゃん
There's no way it'll come true

421
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:26,569
ずっと心の中 住みついている
You've been living inside my heart all along

422
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:30,069
好きにならないほうが無理じゃん
It's impossible not to fall for you, isn't it?

423
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:31,569
どうしようもないじゃん
I can't help it, can I?

424
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:34,569
最初から決まってた
It was decided from the start

425
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:36,569
あなたは あなたは
That you are, you are

426
00:23:37,069 --> 00:23:40,569
多分きっと運命の人
Probably, surely, my person of destiny

427
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:52,569
特別だと思う やっぱり
I think you're special, after all

428
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:55,069
あなたの一挙手一投足が
Every move you make

429
00:23:55,069 --> 00:24:00,069
気になって 気になって
Is on my mind, so much

430
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:03,069
好きになっちゃダメな人
The person you shouldn't fall in love with

431
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:05,569
負けじゃん 勝てるわけないじゃん
I've lost already, haven't I? There's no way I can win

432
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:10,569
そのずるい笑顔に 飲み込まれてゆく
I'm being swallowed up by that unfair smile of yours

433

好きになっちゃダメな人
The person you shouldn't fall in love with

434
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:15,569
こんなのってないじゃん
This is so unfair, isn't it?

435
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:18,569
最初から分かってた
I knew it from the start

436
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:20,569

好きになっちゃダメな人
The person you shouldn't fall in love with

440
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:57,069
Hi!

441
00:24:57,569 --> 00:24:59,069
Yay!

442
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:02,581
See, I told you it was groovy, right?

443
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:04,981
Now, I'm ready to sing the next song.

444
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:06,681
Are you ready? Are you ready?

445
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:07,781
Are you ready? Are you ready?

446
00:25:07,781 --> 00:25:08,881
Are you ready? Are you ready?

447
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:10,081
Are you ready? Are you ready?

448
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:11,781
I want to sing, oh...

449
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:13,281
I want to sing, um...

450
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:15,181
Ah, ini gimana sih kameramennya?
Ah, what's with the cameraman?

451
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:16,481
Gimana sih?
What's going on?

452
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,181
Mutar-mutar gak jelas.
Spinning around aimlessly.

453
00:25:18,481 --> 00:25:20,181
Hey, di sini, di sini!
Hey, over here, over here!

454
00:25:20,381 --> 00:25:22,181
Gini gini gini.
Like this, this, this.

455
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:23,781
Gini, di sini. Di sini.
Like this, over here. Over here.

456
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:25,381
Di sini, di sini. Bukan di sana.
Over here, over here. Not over there.

457

Sudahlah, whatever.
Forget it, whatever.

458
00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:30,081
Okay, so next song...

459
00:25:30,281 --> 00:25:31,981
...I'm gonna be singing...

460
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:33,881
Are you guys still staying with me?

461
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:35,381
Don't get motion sick, okay?

462
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:37,081
Are you staying with me?

463
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:39,081
You're gonna stay with me for the next song, right?

464
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:40,081
Are you? Are you?

465
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:41,581
Okay, let's go!

466
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,381
Okay.

467
00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:52,781
What if I just sit down?

468
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:54,181
What if I just sit down?

469
00:25:54,281 --> 00:25:55,381
Just like...

470
00:26:03,581 --> 00:26:04,881
Okay, nyaman nih.
Okay, this is comfortable.

471
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:06,581
Aduh.
Ouch.

472
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:07,781
Ayaya.

473
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:09,181
Aya ya ya ya.

474
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:10,581
Duduk kayak begini, ya?
Sitting like this, huh?

475
00:26:10,681 --> 00:26:11,881
Gimana sih? Segini aja deh.
How about this? Just this much.

476
00:26:12,181 --> 00:26:14,381
Okay, ready!

477
00:26:19,181 --> 00:26:21,981

私は私
I am me

484

あなたはあなたと
You are you

485
00:26:50,681 --> 00:26:51,981
昨夜言ってた
What you said last night

486
00:26:52,581 --> 00:26:54,081
そんな気もするわ
I feel that way too

487
00:26:58,781 --> 00:27:00,181
グレーのジャケットに
In your gray jacket

488
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:02,181
見覚えがある
It looks familiar

489
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:04,181
コーヒーのしみ
The coffee stain

490
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:08,281
相変わらずなのね
You're still the same, aren't you?

491
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:10,281
ショーウィンドウに
In the show window

二人映れば
When the two of us are reflected

493
00:27:18,781 --> 00:27:20,181
Stay with me

494
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:22,181
真夜中のドアを叩き
Knocking on the midnight door

495
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:24,481
帰らないでと泣いた
I cried, begging you not to go home

496
00:27:25,181 --> 00:27:26,481
あの季節が 今 目の前
That season is now before my eyes

497
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:28,481
Stay with me

498
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:30,481
口ぐせを言いながら
While saying your favorite phrase

499
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:32,481
二人の瞬間を抱いて
Holding onto our moments together

500
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:34,581
まだ忘れず
I still haven't forgotten

501
00:27:34,881 --> 00:27:37,381
大事にしていた
I held it dear

502
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:06,881
恋と愛とは
Love and affection

503
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:08,881
違うものだよと
Are different things, you said

504
00:28:13,281 --> 00:28:14,981
昨夜言われた
You told me last night

505
00:28:15,381 --> 00:28:16,981
そんな気もするわ
I feel that way too

506
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:23,081
二度目の冬が来て
A second winter came

507
00:28:23,381 --> 00:28:25,081
離れていった
And drifted away

508
00:28:25,381 --> 00:28:27,081
あなたの心
Your heart

509
00:28:29,481 --> 00:28:31,181
振り返ればいつも
Whenever I look back

510
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:33,181
そこにあなたを
You were always there

511
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:36,081
感じていたの
I felt your presence

512
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:43,081
Stay with me

513
00:28:43,381 --> 00:28:45,081
真夜中のドアを叩き
Knocking on the midnight door

514
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:47,381
心に穴があいた
A hole opened in my heart

515
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:49,281
あの季節が 今 目の前
That season is now before my eyes

516
00:28:49,581 --> 00:28:51,281
Stay with me

517
00:28:51,581 --> 00:28:53,281
寂しさ紛らわして
Trying to distract myself from loneliness

518
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:55,281
おいたレコードの針
The needle of the record I placed

519
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:57,281
同じメロディ
The same melody

520
00:28:57,681 --> 00:29:00,081
繰り返していた
Was repeating

521
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:43,181
Stay with me

522
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,181
真夜中のドアを叩き
Knocking on the midnight door

523
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:47,381
帰らないでと泣いた
I cried, begging you not to go home

524
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:49,281
あの季節が 今 目の前
That season is now before my eyes

525
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:51,281
Stay with me

526
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,393
...Stay with me

527
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:04,693
口癖を言いながら
While saying your favorite phrase

528
00:30:05,193 --> 00:30:09,593
二人の時間を抱いて
Holding our time together

529
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:17,093
まだ忘れず 暖めてた
Not yet forgotten, I was keeping it warm

530
00:30:17,393 --> 00:30:20,593
Stay with me

531
00:30:20,593 --> 00:30:24,093
真夜中のドアを叩き
Knocking on the midnight door

532
00:30:24,093 --> 00:30:28,593
帰らないでと泣いた
And cried, "Don't go home"

533
00:30:29,893 --> 00:30:33,893
あの季節が 今 目の前
That season is now before my eyes

534
00:30:34,393 --> 00:30:37,093
Stay with me

535
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:41,093
口癖を言いながら
While saying your favorite phrase

536
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:46,093
二人の時間を抱いて
Holding our time together

537
00:30:47,393 --> 00:30:52,593
まだ忘れず 暖めてた
Not yet forgotten, I was keeping it warm

538
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:55,393
Stay with me

539
00:30:55,393 --> 00:30:58,793
真夜中のドアを叩き
Knocking on the midnight door

540
00:30:58,793 --> 00:31:03,593
帰らないでと泣いた
And cried, "Don't go home"

541
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:09,093
あの季節が 今 目の前
That season is now before my eyes

542
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:12,093
Stay with me

543
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:39,093
[Cries]

544
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:43,593
Did you stay during the whole concert? Did you leave?

545
00:31:44,093 --> 00:31:47,093
I saw two or three people just left.

546
00:31:48,093 --> 00:31:51,593
Even though the song was called "Stay With Me",

547
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:54,093
but some people still left. Why?

548
00:31:54,593 --> 00:31:56,593
Heartless! Heartless!

549
00:31:56,593 --> 00:32:00,093
Human beings are so heartless.

550
00:32:00,593 --> 00:32:02,593
Ampun Gusti!
Lord have mercy!

551
00:32:04,593 --> 00:32:08,593
You know, this song, "Stay With Me",

552
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,593
I've been singing it in like unarchived karaoke,

553
00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:14,593
even like I think archived karaokes back then.

554
00:32:14,593 --> 00:32:18,093
I sang a lot of versions of "Stay With Me".

555
00:32:18,593 --> 00:32:22,593
So this was my... chibi performance.

556
00:32:22,593 --> 00:32:25,093
So I hope you guys liked that one.

557
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:28,093
Because the next one is even more...

558
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:30,593
Don't be scared.

559
00:32:30,593 --> 00:32:35,593
The next one is even more sickeningly sweet.

560
00:32:36,593 --> 00:32:40,093
But, but, I have a surprise because the next one...

561
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:43,593
...just like the previous song...

562
00:32:43,593 --> 00:32:47,093
I forgot to mention this because I'm dumb,

563
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:51,593
but I forgot to mention that the previous song I sang was in Vestia-vision.

564
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:56,093
This song as well, I'm gonna have Vestia to come take over my...

565
00:32:56,093 --> 00:33:00,593
...my body, this is my body, and sing for me.

566
00:33:00,593 --> 00:33:02,593
Is that okay?

567
00:33:03,093 --> 00:33:07,593
So we're gonna welcome Vestia here, okay?

568
00:33:07,593 --> 00:33:10,093
Zeta!

569
00:33:10,093 --> 00:33:12,593
Where are you?

570
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:16,093
Zeta!

571
00:33:25,593 --> 00:33:29,593
Love Song / Mosawo

572
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:38,093
候補に書き出す
I start writing down candidates

573
00:33:38,093 --> 00:33:42,593
感情任せの思いを綴って
Writing down thoughts left to my emotions

574
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:52,093
繰り返し消してみては
I try erasing them over and over

575
00:33:52,593 --> 00:33:57,093
ありがちな台詞ばかり
But they're all just cliché lines

576
00:33:59,593 --> 00:34:02,093
あなた以外は
Other than you

577
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:05,593
いらないなんて
Something like not needing anything

578
00:34:06,593 --> 00:34:12,593
簡単な恋や愛だけじゃまだ
Simple love or affection still can't...

579
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:17,593
語りきれないよ
...fully express it all

580
00:34:18,593 --> 00:34:22,093
愛しいだけじゃ足りないよ
Just being beloved isn't enough

581
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:26,593
歌に乗せて送りたい
I want to send my feelings in a song

582
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:31,593
息継ぎすら忘れるほどあなたを紡ぐ
Spinning words for you so much I even forget to breathe

583
00:34:32,093 --> 00:34:36,593
止まらない胸の騒ぎは
This unstoppable unrest in my chest

584
00:34:37,093 --> 00:34:40,093
朝を追い越したってでも
Even if it overtakes the morning, still...

585
00:34:40,093 --> 00:34:43,093
でもああまだ
Still, ah, not yet

586
00:34:43,093 --> 00:34:46,093
声に出せないのラブソング
It's a love song I can't put into words

587
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:52,093
いつか吐息混じりの「愛してる」を
Someday, a sigh-filled "I love you"

588
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,905
四小節の中
In these four bars

589
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:13,705
不細工な心　まとめられたらな
I wish I could gather up this ugly heart

590
00:35:14,505 --> 00:35:18,205
打ち明けすぎないよう
So that I don't reveal too much

591
00:35:18,555 --> 00:35:26,305
ちょっと下手な振りして解けた
I pretended to be a bit bad at it and it came undone

592
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:33,505
私をもっと見ていてほしい
I want you to look at me more

593
00:35:33,855 --> 00:35:39,805
なんて今夜限りのメロディを
A melody for tonight only

594
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:48,305
聴いてくれたりしないかな
I wonder if you'd listen to it

595
00:35:51,205 --> 00:35:53,405
だめかな
Is it no good?

596
00:36:11,205 --> 00:36:14,305
数え切れないフレーズも
Countless phrases too

597
00:36:14,655 --> 00:36:18,205
二度と出せない響きも
And the sounds I can never make again

598
00:36:18,455 --> 00:36:23,805
伝えたいよ　起承転結はいらないから
I want to tell you, I don't need a beginning, middle, and end

599
00:36:24,105 --> 00:36:29,405
何も手に付かないほど
So much that I can't focus on anything

600
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:35,905
奏でている鼓動が今ねぇ
The pulse I'm playing now, hey

601
00:36:36,305 --> 00:36:38,605
また窓を曇らせていくルーム
It's fogging up the windows of the room again

602
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:44,305
ただひたすら貴方を歌うよ
I'll just keep singing about you

603
00:36:49,105 --> 00:36:52,405
声を枯らして叫んだよ
I shouted until my voice was hoarse

604
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:55,405
腹が立つくらい愛
An love that almost makes me angry

605
00:36:55,805 --> 00:37:00,905
吐き出しても体温だけ上がったままで
Even if I spit it out, my body temperature stays high

606
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:04,305
僕は求めたりしない
I won't ask for anything more

607
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,505
貴方を愛するためだけ
Just for the sake of loving you

608
00:37:07,855 --> 00:37:14,605
生まれたの自信ないままの歌声
I was born with this voice, still lacking confidence

609
00:37:15,105 --> 00:37:23,605
いつか綺麗に透き通る愛してるを
One day, a beautiful, transparent "I love you"

610
00:37:24,905 --> 00:37:28,205
愛してるを
I love you

611
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:42,205
Waaaaa! Hehehe.

612
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:44,505
How was that?

613
00:37:44,905 --> 00:37:47,605
Are you guys happy? Are you guys happy?

614
00:37:47,905 --> 00:37:53,305
So we're onto the next song, which will make you guys even more happy.

615
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:54,505
Are you guys happy?

616
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:56,605
I haven't heard your voice. Hello?

617
00:37:56,805 --> 00:37:58,305
Are you happy?

618
00:37:58,705 --> 00:38:00,305
Senang gak?
Are you happy?

619
00:38:00,705 --> 00:38:02,205
Senang gak?
Are you happy?

620
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:08,605
So weird talking to myself in VR.

621
00:38:08,805 --> 00:38:10,605
It's okay, I'm used to it.

622
00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:12,405
Are you guys happy?

623
00:38:12,605 --> 00:38:13,605
Because...

624
00:38:13,805 --> 00:38:14,905
I'm the happiest.

625
00:38:15,105 --> 00:38:17,605
You know what makes me so happy? Now that I think about it.

626
00:38:17,905 --> 00:38:19,905
I have one thing that makes me so happy.

627
00:38:20,205 --> 00:38:22,605
Pockets! Pockets!

628
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:28,305
I'm thinking, so for my next song, it's something related to happiness, I think.

629
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:32,505
Sometimes, you know, when you get too happy, you start to question yourself.

630
00:38:32,705 --> 00:38:34,705
You're like, "Hmm... is it really okay for me to be this happy?"

631
00:38:37,805 --> 00:38:41,305
Kayak, "Hah? Kok iya boleh ya sesenang ini?" Hah?
Like, "Huh? Is it really okay to be this happy?" Huh?

632
00:38:41,305 --> 00:38:42,605
Kok iya? Senang ya?
Is that so? Happy, right?

633
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:51,105
So, I think this next song I'm gonna be wearing something... I'm gonna be wearing something that makes me happy.

634
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:54,405
Oh, wait. Don't. I know what you guys are about to say.

635
00:38:54,705 --> 00:38:58,105
You guys are gonna say that I have six ears, which is not true.

636
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:01,105
It's just not true, I don't have six ears.

637
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,305
Okay, let me get ready. Should I go on all fours like a furry?

638
00:39:04,605 --> 00:39:07,605
Guys? This?

639
00:39:10,405 --> 00:39:13,305
Kayak kucing. Kayak kucing beneran nggak sih? Kayak...
Like a cat. Do I look like a real cat? Like...

640
00:39:13,905 --> 00:39:15,405
Kayaknya nggak gitu deh.
I don't think so.

641
00:39:15,805 --> 00:39:17,605
Kalau tampak belakang giman?
How about the back view?

642
00:39:18,205 --> 00:39:21,105
Tapi norak nggak sih kalau misalnya mulai lagunya dari belakang?
But isn't it tacky if, for example, the song starts from the back?

643
00:39:21,605 --> 00:39:23,605
Apa dari sini? Hmm...
Or from here? Hmm...

644
00:39:24,105 --> 00:39:25,605
Apa ya deh? Entahlah.
What should I do? I don't know.

645
00:39:26,305 --> 00:39:29,105
Nge-split nggak sih? Jangan jangan jangan.
Should I split? No, no, no.

646
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:32,505
Ya udah gini aja. Berdiri aja deh.
Okay, let's just do this. I'll just stand.

647
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,305
Okay, ready?

648
00:39:39,305 --> 00:39:41,305
Okay, I'm ready!

本日ハレの日 雨でもハレ
Today is a celebratory day, even if it rains, it's sunny

658
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:15,117
一生に一度のエブリデイ だけどやっぱり今日はスペシャル
A once-in-a-lifetime everyday, but today is special after all

659
00:40:15,617 --> 00:40:22,117
本日の衣装は悩みません
I won't worry about today's outfit

660
00:40:23,117 --> 00:40:30,117
一周回ってまシンプル だけどアレでもやっぱ派手すぎ？
In the end, it's simple, but is it still too flashy?

662
00:40:38,117 --> 00:40:42,117
どうでもいいことと超重要かもね
Things that don't matter and things that might be super important

663
00:40:42,617 --> 00:40:47,617
そして大事なこと まずはトゥデイのぶち上げよう
And an important thing, first let's hype up today

664
00:40:48,117 --> 00:40:49,117
おめでとう！
Congratulations!

665
00:40:49,217 --> 00:40:53,117
私こんなに幸せでいいのかな
Is it okay for me to be this happy?

666
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:57,117
なんてホントはそのこと悩んでないけど
I say that, but I'm not actually worried about it

667
00:40:57,217 --> 00:41:00,617
だってちょっとくらいのマイナスもなきゃ
Because there should be at least a little bit of negative

668
00:41:00,717 --> 00:41:04,117
って思うくらいにいい感じ
It feels so good that I think that

669
00:41:04,217 --> 00:41:07,617
まぁね こんなに幸せでいいので
Well, since it's okay to be this happy

670
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:11,617
だって私自分で選んだんだから
Because I chose it myself

671
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:14,617
犬は駆け回り 猫は可愛いし
Dogs run around, cats are cute

672
00:41:15,117 --> 00:41:18,617
青い鳥は飛ぶ みんながいる
Bluebirds fly, everyone is here

673
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:34,117
当日はケの日 普通にいい
The day itself is an ordinary day, it's normally good

674
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:42,117
一生で一番ギャングな日 だけど仕方ないですよ
The most "gang" day of my life, but it can't be helped

675
00:41:42,617 --> 00:41:49,617
って感じで冷めたりもしてるよ
I'm feeling a bit detached like that too

676
00:41:50,117 --> 00:41:56,617
サプライズのメッセージ 驚くはずないでお決まり
A surprise message, I won't be surprised, it's standard

677
00:41:57,117 --> 00:42:04,117
一昨年の今は他人で それまではたくさんもっと
Two years ago today we were strangers, until then, much more

678
00:42:04,617 --> 00:42:08,617
無駄かも手放せないとかしあわせね
It might be pointless, but being unable to let go is happiness, isn't it?

679
00:42:09,117 --> 00:42:14,117
だけど大事なこと 今は本当に大好きで
But an important thing, right now I really love it

680
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:15,617
おめでとう！
Congratulations!

681
00:42:15,717 --> 00:42:19,117
あなたこんなに幸せでいいのかな
Is it okay for you to be this happy?

682
00:42:19,217 --> 00:42:23,117
なんてホントはそのこと心配ないけど
I say that, but I'm not actually worried about it

683
00:42:23,217 --> 00:42:27,117
だってちょっとくらいの試練もなきゃ
Because there should be at least a little bit of trial

684
00:42:27,217 --> 00:42:30,617
って思うくらいにいい感じ
It feels so good that I think that

685
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:34,617
まぁね 結局幸せでいいので
Well, in the end, it's okay to be happy

686
00:42:35,117 --> 00:42:38,617
だって私ちゃんと戦ったんだから
Because I fought properly

687
00:42:38,867 --> 00:42:41,617
お神輿に乗って 花火も上げて
Ride the portable shrine, set off fireworks

688
00:42:42,117 --> 00:42:46,117
いいことは全部一度にしよう
Let's do all the good things at once

689
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:19,617
おめでとう！
Congratulations!

690
00:43:19,717 --> 00:43:23,617
私こんなに幸せでいいのかな
Is it okay for me to be this happy?

691
00:43:23,717 --> 00:43:27,617
なんてホントはそのこと悩んでないけど
I say that, but I'm not actually worried about it

692
00:43:27,717 --> 00:43:31,117
だってちょっとくらいのマイナスもなきゃ
Because there should be at least a little bit of negative

693
00:43:31,217 --> 00:43:34,617
って思うくらいにいい感じ
It feels so good that I think that

694
00:43:34,717 --> 00:43:38,117
まぁね こんなに幸せでいいので
Well, since it's okay to be this happy

695
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:42,117
だって私自分で選んだんだから

696
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:45,617
犬は駆け回り 猫は可愛いし
Dogs run around, cats are cute

697
00:43:45,867 --> 00:43:49,117
青い鳥は飛ぶ みんながいる

698
00:43:49,617 --> 00:43:54,117
最高の今におめでとうだよ
Congratulations to this greatest moment

699
00:44:15,617 --> 00:44:19,117
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay...

700
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:22,117
Mic check, mic check, one, two.

701
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:25,117
Mic check, one, two, ay, ay, ay...

702
00:44:28,117 --> 00:44:30,617
What's up?

703
00:44:30,617 --> 00:44:34,117
DJ Seven on the house, yo!

704
00:44:35,117 --> 00:44:40,117
So, next song is the rap of the night.

705
00:44:40,217 --> 00:44:45,117
Actually, it's not even rap. I don't know if you guys... it's the rap of the night, for sure.

706
00:44:45,217 --> 00:44:49,617
Can you... can you trust me enough if I say it's a rap song?

707
00:44:49,617 --> 00:44:52,617
What if it's like a ballad? A ballad song.

708
00:44:53,117 --> 00:44:56,617
Anyway, so I have a really cool song...

709
00:44:56,617 --> 00:45:00,117
...and I want you guys to scream with me!

710
00:45:00,729 --> 00:45:03,229
Everyone with me, okay?

711
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:08,129
Practice your screaming now. Ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah! Okay.

712
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:13,629
Okay, I want you guys to prepare your highest voice, okay?

713
00:45:14,329 --> 00:45:18,629
Let's go! Let's go! I want you guys to scream as loud as you can, okay?

714
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:24,529
Because this is the last song! Wooh! Let's go!

715
00:45:25,229 --> 00:45:31,529
Let's end it with a bang! Duru-ru-ru, pom-pom-pom-pom!

716
00:45:36,629 --> 00:45:43,129
思い出すのは 君の歌
歌い笑う 顔が鮮明だ
どこに行ってしまったの
What I remember is your song
The face that sings and laughs is vivid
Where have you gone?

717
00:45:39,129 --> 00:45:46,129
Kaijuu no Hanauta (怪獣の花唄) / Vaundy
Monster's Song / Vaundy

718
00:45:43,544 --> 00:45:48,129
いつも探すんだよ
I'm always looking for it.

719
00:45:49,653 --> 00:45:56,129
思い出すのは 君の歌
歌い笑う 顔が鮮明だ
君に似合うんだよ
What I remember is your song
The face that sings and laughs is vivid
It suits you well.

720
00:45:56,646 --> 00:46:01,129
ずっと見ていたいよ
I want to watch you forever.

721
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:09,629
でも最後に 見たいのは
きっともう 君の夢の中
もう一度
But in the end, what I want to see
Is probably already in your dreams
Once more

722
00:46:10,162 --> 00:46:15,629
また聴かせてくれよ
聴きたいんだ
Please let me hear it again
I want to hear it

723
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:22,129
もっと騒げ怪獣の歌
まだ消えない 夢の歌となれ
Make more noise, monster's song
The dream song that hasn't faded away yet, become the song

724
00:46:22,693 --> 00:46:29,129
君がいつも 歌う怪獣の歌
まだ消えない 口ずさんでしまうよ
The monster's song you always sing
I end up humming it, it hasn't faded yet

725
00:46:41,495 --> 00:46:47,629
思い出すのは 君がいた
ギター持てる 君がいた
What I remember is that you were there
You were there with a guitar

726
00:46:48,466 --> 00:46:54,129
忘れられないんだよ
だったら僕が歌うよ
I can't forget
If that's the case, I'll sing

727
00:46:55,026 --> 00:47:01,129
でも最後に 見たいのは
きっともう 君の夢の中
もう一度
But in the end, what I want to see
Is probably already in your dreams
Once more

728
00:47:01,963 --> 00:47:07,129
また聴かせてくれよ
聴きたいんだ
Please let me hear it again
I want to hear it

729
00:47:07,957 --> 00:47:13,629
もっと騒げ怪獣の歌
まだ消えない 夢の歌となれ
Make more noise, monster's song
The dream song that hasn't faded away yet, become the song

730
00:47:14,493 --> 00:47:21,129
君がいつも 歌う怪獣の歌
まだ消えない 口ずさんでしまうよ
The monster's song you always sing
I end up humming it, it hasn't faded yet

731
00:47:32,546 --> 00:47:38,129
落ちていく 過去は鮮明で
見せたい 未来は繊細で
The falling past is vivid
The future I want to show is delicate

732
00:47:39,112 --> 00:47:45,129
過ぎていく 日々には鈍感な君へ
To you, who are insensitive to the passing days

733
00:47:45,551 --> 00:47:51,129
落ちていく 過去は鮮明で
見せたい 未来は繊細で
The falling past is vivid
The future I want to show is delicate

734
00:47:52,045 --> 00:47:58,129
過ぎていく 日々には鈍感な君へ
To you, who are insensitive to the passing days

735
00:47:58,659 --> 00:48:04,629
ねぇ もっと騒げ怪獣の歌
まだ消えない 夢の歌となれ
Hey, make more noise, monster's song
The dream song that hasn't faded away yet, become the song

736
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:12,129
君がいつも 歌う怪獣の歌
まだ消えない 口ずさんでしまうよ
The monster's song you always sing
I end up humming it, it hasn't faded yet

737
00:48:24,214 --> 00:48:30,129
眠れない 夜に 手を伸ばして
Stretching out hands into the sleepless night

738
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:34,629
眠れない 夜に また伸ばして
Stretching out hands again into the sleepless night

739
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:38,629
そんな日々でいたいのに
Even though I want to stay in such days

740
00:48:39,246 --> 00:48:43,129
懲りずに 手を伸ばして
Without learning, stretching out hands

741
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:52,129
眠れない 夜に また伸ばして
そんな夜に 歌う怪獣の歌
Stretching out hands again into the sleepless night
The monster's song sung on such a night

742
00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:25,629
Yay! How was it? Did you guys enjoy the performance?

743
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:31,129
Hehe, fantastic side eye in this. I hope you guys liked it!

744
00:49:31,529 --> 00:49:36,129
I enjoyed it as well! I've always wanted to do a mini-live,

745
00:49:36,629 --> 00:49:42,629
so it's a dream come true that I get to do a mini-live for you.

746
00:49:43,129 --> 00:49:47,129
And, uh, I have Basil with me, I have you guys with me,

747
00:49:47,629 --> 00:49:54,129
although you guys are behind those screens in front of me, it's okay.

748
00:49:54,729 --> 00:49:59,629
Uh, I had so much fun! Thank you for staying with me for the past two years!

749
00:50:00,191 --> 00:50:01,391
...um, here's to...

750
00:50:01,391 --> 00:50:04,441
...hopefully many, many years in the future, you know?

751
00:50:04,741 --> 00:50:06,241
Many, many more.

752
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:08,241
Many, many more.

753
00:50:11,991 --> 00:50:12,791
Okay?

754
00:50:13,191 --> 00:50:15,541
Aku peres kalian sampai habis.
I'll squeeze you all until there's nothing left.

755
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:19,541
Jasad kalian.
Your corpses.

756
00:50:20,591 --> 00:50:22,941
Jadi, hari ini kita berhenti di sini.
So, we'll stop here for today.

757
00:50:23,391 --> 00:50:26,641
今日は終わりたいと思うんですけど...
I'd like to end it today, but...

758
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:31,941
But, but but but but but but but but...

759
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:34,541
Not before...

760
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:38,141
Not before I do something...

761
00:50:38,941 --> 00:50:40,541
...which is...
