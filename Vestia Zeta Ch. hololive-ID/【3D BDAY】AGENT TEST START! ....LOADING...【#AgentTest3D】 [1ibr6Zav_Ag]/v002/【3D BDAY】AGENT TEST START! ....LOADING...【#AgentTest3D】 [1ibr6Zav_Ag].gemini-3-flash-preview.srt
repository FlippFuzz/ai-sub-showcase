3D Birthday - Secret Agent Test

3
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,250
Wait, this is good.

4
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,200
I did it!

5
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,480
I infiltrated this place.

6
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,520
Success!

7
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,350
大成功だ！
It's a huge success!

8
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,750
Huh?

9
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,310
あ！みんなに見られた！
Ah! Everyone saw me!

10
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,500
うわああ！
Uwaaa!

11
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,500
Vestia Zeta

12
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,310
I can't believe you guys

13
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,500
were watching me this whole time! Noooo!

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,560
To be honest, um, I did feel...

15
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,840
I did feel eyes on me, but um,

16
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,500
I knew you guys were watching. It's okay.

17
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,020
Anyway, it's not the time to be

18
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,350
talking about that because today is a

19
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,000
special day for thee... for me! Yay!

20
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,480
Uh, today is... Do you know what today is?

21
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,450
Say it, say it! Say it, say it!

22
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,120
ご存じですよね？言って！
You know, don't you? Say it!

23
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,500
Yeah! Today is my birthday!

24
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,540
Happy birthday Zeta, Happy birthday Zeta,

25
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,720
Selamat ulang tahun, Happy birthday Zeta,
Happy birthday, Happy birthday Zeta,

26
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,180
Gitu gak sih lagunya? I don't know.
Is that how the song goes? I don't know.

27
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,540
Well...

28
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,450
Oh, what? You're saying something? Huh?

29
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,150
Mmm, nope.

30
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,210
Skill... skill... skill issue?

31
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,540
You're saying I'm a noob as a secret agent?

32
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,650
Bulls... okay, I can't say the rest, bulls...

33
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,850
Your lies, you're lying! That can't be true.

34
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,540
I've been working hard. I've got the stamina,

35
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,540
and obviously the intelligence.

36
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,920
IQ... IQ 200.

37
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,540
And strength, you know? Like the power as well.

38
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

39
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,020
So anyways, don't you worry because

40
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,620
I've got the perfect thing for today.

41
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Have you ever heard of a...

42
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,540
um... of a... of a Secret Agent School?

43
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,540
Yeah, so, uh, back in my days, back in my days,

44
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,840
I've been through hell and back.

45
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,540
So I invited some transfer students here

46
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,210
so we can prove that I'm the best secret agent,

47
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,500
okay?

48
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,500
So, um, we're gonna do some tests together

49
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,020
to see how tough it is to become a

50
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,450
professional secret agent like me, like me,

51
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,500
like me. I'm a good example.

52
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,500
Anyways, it reminds me of my, um, old

53
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
gakko-izumu, you know? Mmm.

54
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,520
But, to be honest, to be honest, let me...

55
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,680
to be honest, I don't know what we'll be

56
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,100
doing yet, but... ugh.

57
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,540
Wait, oh crap! Okay,

58
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,520
it's almost time for the first test!

59
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,250
最初のテストが... そろそろ...
The first test is... soon...

60
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,540
早く行かないと！
I have to go quickly!

61
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,020
Bye!

62
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,540
これな！
Check this out!

63
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:04,088
なんかさ...
You know...

64
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:05,388
あれ、ゾンビ？
Wait, a zombie?

65
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:07,488
あれ？ (威嚇の声)
Huh? (Intimidation sound)

66
00:05:09,388 --> 00:05:10,988
あれ？なんか... よわの。
Huh? It's somehow... weak.

67
00:05:10,988 --> 00:05:14,388
なんかみこちのカマキリの威嚇ポーズにビビってる。
It's totally scared of Mikochi's mantis intimidation pose.

68
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:15,988
ビビってる？
It's scared?

69
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:17,688
ビビってる。震えてる。
It's scared. It's shaking.

70
00:05:18,988 --> 00:05:20,288
これみこちゃんわかりました。
Miko's figured it out.

71
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:20,988
なに？なに？
What? What?

72
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,188
コイツ、雑魚ゾンビです。
This guy is a weakling zombie.

73
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:24,388
雑魚、雑魚。
Weakling, weakling.

74
00:05:24,388 --> 00:05:26,688
ざぁ〜こ。
W-e-a-k-l-i-n-g.

75
00:05:28,388 --> 00:05:30,488
コイツドMかもしんない。
He might be a total masochist.

76
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:31,788
ドMゾンビ？
A masochist zombie?

77
00:05:31,788 --> 00:05:34,288
ミオちゃんも行け、ミオちゃんも行け。
Mio-chan, you go too. Go, Mio-chan!

78
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:36,988
ポンコツ〜。
Useless~.

79
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:39,588
効いてる！
It's working!

80
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:41,288
あ、じゃあみこちゃんも言っていい？
Oh, then can Miko say it too?

81
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:42,088
いいよ、みこちゃんも言って。
Sure, you say it too.

82
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:43,888
ざぁ〜こ。
W-e-a-k-l-i-n-g.

83
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:45,588
効いてる、効いてる！
It's working, it's working!

84
00:05:45,588 --> 00:05:46,188
珍しい！
Unbelievable!

85
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:47,288
珍しく効いてる！
It's unusually effective!

86
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:49,388
ちょっと弱々ゾンビさんなんじゃない？
Isn't he just a bit of a weakling zombie?

87
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:51,688
全然怖くないんですけど。
I'm not scared at all.

88
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:53,388
余裕かま！
Piece of cake!

89
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,188
うぇ〜い、余裕かま！
Yeeaah, piece of cake!

90
00:05:58,688 --> 00:05:59,788
あー！みんなー！
Ah! Everyone!

91
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:00,688
お、ゼータ！
Oh, Zeta!

92
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:04,088
遅れてごめーーん！
Sorry I'm late!

93
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:05,988
ゼータ、おめでとう！
Zeta, congrats!

94
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:07,988
なにこのゾンビ？
What's with this zombie?

95
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:09,988
あれは、弱々ゾンビ！
That is a weakling zombie!

96
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:11,788
弱々ゾンビがいる。
A weakling zombie is here.

97
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:16,388
エージェントスクールの最初のテストにお招きしたけど、
We were invited for the Agent School's first test, but...

98
00:06:16,988 --> 00:06:19,388
ゾンビも新入生なのかな？
I wonder if the zombie is also a new student?

99
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:22,688
えぇー？新入生？新入生なの？
What? A newcomer? Is he a newcomer?

100
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:24,888
大丈夫なの？
Is it really okay?

101
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:28,288
そうだ、でも言葉通じないけどさ、ゾンビに。
True, but we can't communicate with the zombie.

102
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,788
ゼータはいろんな言葉話せるよね？
Zeta, you can speak many languages, right?

103
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:35,788
ゾンビ語も喋れるんじゃないの？
Can't you speak Zombie-ish too?

104
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:38,188
ええ、ちょっと待って... 行ってきていい？
Eh, wait... Can I try talking to it?

105
00:06:38,188 --> 00:06:39,088
行ってきて、行ってきて。
Go ahead, go ahead.

106
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:40,288
オッケー、オッケー。
Okay, okay.

107
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:41,288
行け！
Go for it!

108
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:44,488
(ゾンビの鳴き声)
(Zombie noises)

109
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,788
ちょっと弱そうかも。
He looks a bit weak.

110
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:50,088
会話してる！
They're having a conversation!

111
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:50,988
あれ？
Wait?

112
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:51,988
会話してる！
They're conversing!

113
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:54,788
よし、できた。
Alright, I did it.

114
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:55,488
できた？！
You did?!

115
00:06:56,588 --> 00:06:57,988
おい！ゾンビ！
Oi! Zombie!

116
00:06:58,288 --> 00:06:59,088
なになに？
What's going on?

117
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:00,088
何してるの？
What are you doing?

118
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:02,088
怖がらせろって言ったでしょ？！
I told you to be scary, right?!

119
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,388
オリーさんだ！
It's Ollie-san!

120
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:05,088
本当に何やってたのよ！
What have you been doing?!

121
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:06,288
怒ってる、怒ってる。
She's mad, she's really mad.

122
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:07,988
ごめんね。
Apologies.

123
00:07:07,988 --> 00:07:11,388
どうやら弱っちいゾンビを送っちゃったみたいね。
I probably sent over the weak zombies.

124
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:12,688
申し訳ないわね。
Sorry about that.

125
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:13,588
さて、
Anyways,

126
00:07:13,588 --> 00:07:16,688
今日はみなさんにサプライズテストをご用意しました。
I called you guys here for a surprise test.

127
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:21,088
シークレットエージェントにふさわしいか、確かめてみましょう。
To see if you guys are fit to be a secret agent.

128
00:07:21,388 --> 00:07:23,888
なになになにー
What what what what?

129
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:25,888
なんかわかんないけど受ける！
I don't really get it, but I'll take it!

130
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:27,388
なんかわかんないけど受けてみるか。
I don't get it either, but let's try it.

131
00:07:27,388 --> 00:07:28,588
受けてみよう！
Let's try it!

132
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:31,788
さてさて、みなさん落ち着いてくださいね。
Okay, okay, calm down everyone.

133
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:38,188
では、この箱の中身を当ててもらうテストになりまーす！
In this test, you will need to guess what is inside the box!

134
00:07:38,188 --> 00:07:40,788
これにはあなたたちの推理力が試されます。
This requires your investigative skills.

135
00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:43,088
ラウンド1では、
For round 1,

136
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:47,388
30秒間だけ中身に触れられます。
you can feel the object for 30 seconds only.

137
00:07:48,188 --> 00:07:49,388
楽しんでくださいね。
Have fun.

138
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:52,388
みなさんのリアクション、すっごく楽しみですね。
Can't wait to see your reactions.

139
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:56,088
いいリアクション期待してるよ、だって。
She says she's expecting good reactions.

140
00:07:57,388 --> 00:07:58,988
完全に理解してるから。
I completely understand it.

141
00:07:58,988 --> 00:08:00,188
本当だ、完全に理解してる。
True, she completely understands.

142
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,688
わかってるってこと？！
You mean you know?!

143
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:02,188
AZKiちゃん！
AZKi-chan!

144
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:04,188
じゃあAZKi先輩からかな？
Then is it AZKi-senpai first?

145
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:06,488
AZKiからですね！
It's from AZKi!

146
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:08,888
任せてくださいよ！
Leave it to me!

147
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:09,988
頑張って！
Good luck!

148
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:10,988
頑張れ！
Good luck!

149
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:13,588
これさ、みんなで協力してだよね？協力して。
This is about everyone cooperating, right? Cooperating.

150
00:08:13,588 --> 00:08:15,488
そうだね、情報を集めよう。
That's right, let's gather information.

151
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:19,788
情報を集めて、伝えることに集中したいと思います。
I'll focus on gathering information and communicating it.

152
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:22,888
AZKiの挑戦
AZKi's Challenge

Is it alive, or what is it... This is a bit...

210
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:45,569
でもこれみんなでね、力合わせて、誰かが当たればいいってこと。
But with everyone working together,
it's fine as long as someone gets it right.

211
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:52,069
プロペラがついたもの... みたいなのが付いてたのかなって思ったんだけど。
Something with a propeller...
I thought maybe it had something like that on it.

212
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:56,569
マジでみこ手入れた瞬間ブルってなったから、うわあってなって。
Seriously, the moment I put my hand in,
it went 'brrr', so I was like 'uwaa'.

213
00:11:57,119 --> 00:12:01,569
アヒルとかの足がこうなんか、バタバタバタバタってなるのとか...
Like a duck's feet going 'flap-flap-flap-flap'...

214
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:05,069
なんかそういうおもちゃ? ミオ先輩は?
Some kind of toy like that? How about you, Mio-senpai?

215
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:09,069
これはズバリ、カエルのおもちゃです!
This is clearly a frog toy!

216
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:12,069
ぴょこぴょこぴょこってしてたってこと?
You mean it was going 'hop-hop-hop'?

224
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:53,569
何がポイントだったんですか? 触った感じがペタペタしてて...
What was the key? It felt kind of sticky...

225
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:57,569
そのペタペタもきも... なんかね、ぴょんぴょんしてたから。
That stickiness is also gross... and because it was hopping.

226
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:03,569
ぴょんぴょんしてたから、これカエルのおもちゃっぽいなって思ったのよね。
Since it was hopping, I thought it seemed like a frog toy.

227
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:14,069

it's hard to say if it's a part of something.

Wait, what am I going to have to do here?

410
00:24:29,332 --> 00:24:33,532
No way. Are we going to have to fight? I'm not good at fighting though.

411
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:36,332
But I mean, I can try.

412
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:38,332

00:27:03,713 --> 00:27:05,913
Good! Everyone has gathered, right?

446
00:27:06,413 --> 00:27:08,213
This is probably a big surprise, huh?

447
00:27:08,413 --> 00:27:11,613
And I'm sure you're all wondering what kind of test this is gonna be!

448
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:13,413
Anyone have any guesses?

449
00:27:13,613 --> 00:27:15,113
Don't say ground pounding.

450
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:19,913
Oh, correct!

451
00:27:20,113 --> 00:27:24,413
We're holding a physical test using this long stick with these Bazo weights

452
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:28,213
to determine if you are fit enough to pass off as a secret agent!

453
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,913
Bazo! Oh my god, okay. That looks heavy.

454
00:27:33,213 --> 00:27:35,913
Okay, okay. For level 1 of the physical test!

455
00:27:36,913 --> 00:27:42,413
First, lift Bazo from the ring mat up to your hips as many times as you can within 30 seconds!

456
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:45,613
For level 2,

457
00:27:45,713 --> 00:27:47,413
the mat will be bumpy!

458
00:27:47,613 --> 00:27:50,913
You'll do the same thing as many times as you can within 30 seconds!

459
00:27:51,613 --> 00:27:53,413
And for the last level,

460
00:27:53,513 --> 00:27:56,413
you'll stand on the bumpy mat and balance a cup on your head!

461
00:27:56,913 --> 00:27:59,613
Make sure you don't drop it, and lift Bazo up!

462
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:02,213
Well then, are you guys ready?

463
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:03,413
Let's go!

464
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:11,413
Okay, who's ready for the physical test?

465
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:18,613
Okay, maybe we should have Bijou start first?

466
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:21,613
Bijou, Bijou, go go go!

467
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:22,913
I got it!

468
00:28:23,413 --> 00:28:26,413
Use your rock hard muscles to lift Bazo.

469
00:28:27,913 --> 00:28:30,413
Okay, are you ready? 3, 2, 1, start!

470
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:37,413
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

471
00:28:38,913 --> 00:28:42,413
6, 7, 8!

472
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:47,413
9, 10, 11!

473
00:28:47,913 --> 00:28:52,413
12, 13, 14, 15!

474
00:28:53,913 --> 00:29:00,913
16, 17, 18, 19, 20!

475
00:29:01,213 --> 00:29:01,913
21!

476
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:02,913
Time's up!

477
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:08,413
21! She's rock hard! Level 1: 21.

478
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,913
Now IRyS! IRyS!

479
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:15,913
I got this. I'm a pro...

480
00:29:16,413 --> 00:29:19,413
I'll show them my pro potential.

481
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:20,913
Start!

482
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:25,413
1, 2, 3, 4!

483
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:30,413
5, 6, 7, 8!

484
00:29:32,413 --> 00:29:37,413
9, 10, 11, 12!

485
00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:42,413
13, 14, 15!

486
00:29:43,913 --> 00:29:48,413
16, 17, 18, 19, 20!

487
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,413
21!

488
00:29:50,513 --> 00:29:51,413
Time's up!

489
00:29:54,913 --> 00:29:58,913
IRyS, 21! It's a tie, it's a tie!

490
00:30:02,128 --> 00:30:04,228
Like I said, it's more of a speed thing, isn't it?

491
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:05,128
Show us.

492
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,078
Ready? Start!

493
00:30:05,228 --> 00:30:06,628
Start!

494
00:30:06,128 --> 00:30:10,628
One! Two! Three! Four! Five!

495
00:30:11,128 --> 00:30:15,628
Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!

496
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:20,628
Eleven! Twelve! Thirteen! Fourteen! Fifteen!

497
00:30:20,128 --> 00:30:21,128
Oh my god!

498
00:30:21,128 --> 00:30:25,628
Sixteen! Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!

499
00:30:24,128 --> 00:30:25,128
She's fast!

500
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:30,628
Twenty-one! Twenty-two! Twenty-three! Twenty-four! Twenty-five!

501
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:35,628
Twenty-six! Twenty-seven! Twenty-eight! Twenty-nine! Thirty!

502
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:37,128
Time's up!

503
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:37,628
Time's up!

504
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,128
Anyway, that was crazy! What's the score?

505
00:30:41,328 --> 00:30:44,128
Twenty-nine!

506
00:30:42,128 --> 00:30:45,128
Calliope Level 1: 29

507
00:30:46,328 --> 00:30:49,128
Okay, now you have to show us what you're made of.

508
00:30:50,128 --> 00:30:53,128
You got this! You got this, Zeta!

509
00:30:53,628 --> 00:30:54,628
You ready?

510
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:55,328
Yeah.

511
00:30:55,428 --> 00:30:56,328
Alright. Start!

512
00:30:56,328 --> 00:30:57,628
Start!

513
00:30:56,628 --> 00:31:01,128
One! Two! Three! Four! Five!

514
00:31:01,628 --> 00:31:06,128
Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!

515
00:31:06,628 --> 00:31:11,128
Eleven! Twelve! Thirteen! Fourteen! Fifteen!

516
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:16,128
Sixteen! Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!

517
00:31:16,628 --> 00:31:21,128
Twenty-one! Twenty-two! Twenty-three! Twenty-four! Twenty-five!

518
00:31:21,628 --> 00:31:26,428
Twenty-six! Twenty-seven! Twenty-eight! Twenty-nine! Thirty!

519
00:31:26,628 --> 00:31:28,628
Time's up!

520
00:31:26,628 --> 00:31:28,628
Time's up!

521
00:31:29,128 --> 00:31:32,128
Whoa! That was awesome exercise!

522
00:31:32,428 --> 00:31:34,528
I can't stand up!

523
00:31:35,128 --> 00:31:36,628
You did great!

524
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:40,128
Zeta Level 1: 30

525
00:31:40,128 --> 00:31:41,628
That was great.

526
00:31:41,728 --> 00:31:44,128
She is a secret agent after all.

527
00:31:44,228 --> 00:31:46,328
I feel like I left my body.

528
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:53,628
Okay, now who's ready for level two?

529
00:31:55,128 --> 00:31:57,628
Oh, I don't know about this one...

530
00:31:57,728 --> 00:32:02,128
Wait a minute, that's not fair. Those are Bijou's brothers!

531
00:32:02,228 --> 00:32:05,128
Yeah, that's nasty! That's not fair!

532
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:12,628
Pebbles, I'm loving it! They're loving it!

533
00:32:13,628 --> 00:32:16,628
Oh, it hurts so... okay. Start!

534
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:18,628
Start!

535
00:32:18,128 --> 00:32:22,628
One! Two! Three! Four! Five!

536
00:32:23,128 --> 00:32:27,628
Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!

537
00:32:28,128 --> 00:32:32,628
Eleven! Twelve! Thirteen! Fourteen! Fifteen!

538
00:32:33,128 --> 00:32:37,628
Sixteen! Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!

539
00:32:38,128 --> 00:32:42,628
Twenty-one! Twenty-two! Twenty-three! Twenty-four! Twenty-five!

540
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:47,628
Twenty-six! Twenty-seven! Twenty-eight! Twenty-nine! Thirty!

541
00:32:47,728 --> 00:32:49,628
Time's up!

542
00:32:47,728 --> 00:32:49,628
Time's up!

543
00:32:53,628 --> 00:32:55,628
Was that her full power?

544
00:32:56,128 --> 00:32:59,128
Bijou Level 2: 34

545
00:32:57,128 --> 00:33:01,128
The rocks were helping me! They gave me strength!

546
00:33:05,128 --> 00:33:07,628
One's running away!

547
00:33:08,128 --> 00:33:12,628
Go on, show the world again, prove to the world that you are strong.

548
00:33:12,728 --> 00:33:15,128
Take your time. How does it feel?

549
00:33:15,628 --> 00:33:18,128
Tell me when you're ready. Ready!

550
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:19,528
Start!

551
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:19,628
Start!

552
00:33:19,628 --> 00:33:24,128
One! Two! Three! Four! Five!

553
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:29,128
Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!

554
00:33:29,628 --> 00:33:34,128
Eleven! Twelve! Thirteen! Fourteen! Fifteen!

555
00:33:34,628 --> 00:33:39,128
Sixteen! Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!

556
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:44,128
Twenty-one! Twenty-two! Twenty-three! Twenty-four! Twenty-five!

557
00:33:44,628 --> 00:33:48,628
Twenty-six! Twenty-seven! Twenty-eight! Twenty-nine! Thirty!

558
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:50,628
Time's up!

559
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:50,628
Time's up!

560
00:33:56,128 --> 00:33:59,128
IRyS Level 2: 20

561
00:33:56,628 --> 00:33:59,128
She's lost for words. I think she's okay.

562
00:34:00,628 --> 00:34:03,128
I'm not gonna go that hard, I'm not...

563
00:34:03,228 --> 00:34:06,128
The pebbles are gonna help her out, so...

564
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,628
Well, I'll try to just do my best.

565
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:12,628
Tell me when you're ready. Alright, I'm good.

566
00:34:14,628 --> 00:34:15,328
Start!

567
00:34:15,128 --> 00:34:16,628
Start!

568
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:20,128
One! Two! Three! Four! Five!

569
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:25,128
Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!

570
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:30,128
Eleven! Twelve! Thirteen! Fourteen! Fifteen!

571
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:35,128
Sixteen! Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!

572
00:34:35,628 --> 00:34:40,128
Twenty-one! Twenty-two! Twenty-three! Twenty-four! Twenty-five!

573
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:45,828
Twenty-six! Twenty-seven! Twenty-eight! Twenty-nine! Thirty!

574
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:48,128
Time's up!

575
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:48,128
Time's up!

576
00:34:50,128 --> 00:34:54,128
Yogi! Yogi! Yogi!

577
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:58,628
You got more than your first time! Thirty-two!

578
00:34:59,128 --> 00:35:02,128
Your form was perfect! I counted thirty-three.

579
00:35:05,043 --> 00:35:06,443
It was...

580
00:35:06,443 --> 00:35:08,643
The final count is 32!

581
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:11,443
Yay! I'll take it!

582
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,443
Step on those pebbles like they're rocks.

583
00:35:14,743 --> 00:35:15,643
Bibo gives you permission.

584
00:35:15,743 --> 00:35:17,143
Yeah, Bibo gives me permission.

585
00:35:17,243 --> 00:35:18,243
Can I step on it?

586
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:21,443
Whoa! Oh! [Screams in pain]

587
00:35:21,543 --> 00:35:23,443
She's going Super Saiyan!

588
00:35:24,343 --> 00:35:25,443
Something's coming out of me!

589
00:35:26,643 --> 00:35:28,343
Okay! All Zeta, are you ready?

590
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:29,243
Yeah!

591
00:35:29,443 --> 00:35:32,443
Three, two, one, GO!

592
00:35:32,743 --> 00:36:02,443
1, 2, 3, 4, 5... 38!

593
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:05,443
Time's up!

594
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:10,443
This is our potential level score!

595
00:36:12,943 --> 00:36:14,943
I'm glad you guys are having fun!

596
00:36:14,943 --> 00:36:18,443
Level 3 of the physical test is gonna be pretty tough, though.

597
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:19,943
You guys ready?

598
00:36:20,443 --> 00:36:24,243
For level 3, I've got a little something behind me...

599
00:36:24,243 --> 00:36:26,443
...which is a...

600
00:36:26,443 --> 00:36:27,943
A cup! A cup!

601
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:30,243
Would you like a cup of tea?

602
00:36:30,443 --> 00:36:32,443
Um, maybe later?

603
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:35,243
While you guys are stepping... while we are stepping...

604
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:37,443
...on the bumpy mat, we're also gonna be...

605
00:36:37,443 --> 00:36:41,943
...balancing this cup on top of our head like this.

606
00:36:42,443 --> 00:36:44,443
Wait, so we still have to use the mat?

607
00:36:45,443 --> 00:36:47,443
Yes! It's a combination of everything.

608
00:36:49,943 --> 00:36:52,443
And while lifting as well, of course.

609
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:56,943
Yeah, it doesn't affect us at all! It doesn't affect us at all!

610
00:36:58,943 --> 00:37:02,443
Okay, crown the princess! Crown the princess!

611
00:37:02,943 --> 00:37:07,443
There you go! It's so over! It's so over!

612
00:37:08,943 --> 00:37:11,443
Bibopeople, are you ready?

613
00:37:11,443 --> 00:37:14,443
Remember to use your butt and your legs. Form is important.

614
00:37:14,743 --> 00:37:17,243
Okay, butt and my legs. Form.

615
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,943
Are you ready?

616
00:37:19,943 --> 00:37:21,443
Start!

617
00:37:21,743 --> 00:37:51,443
1, 2, 3, 4, 5... 28!

618
00:37:51,943 --> 00:37:53,443
Time's up!

619
00:37:53,943 --> 00:37:56,943
Whoa! The teacup was like stuck on her head.

620
00:37:56,943 --> 00:38:00,443
And then it turned over and it was hot on her head! Oh, that was so funny.

621
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:03,443
28! You got 28! Congrats!

622
00:38:04,943 --> 00:38:06,443
IRyS! It's IRyS!

623
00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:08,443
IRyS is princess!

624
00:38:08,443 --> 00:38:11,443
I have to do this? Beautiful posture...

625
00:38:11,543 --> 00:38:13,943
Exactly, yeah! Beautiful posture.

626
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:18,443
This is IRyS's strong point because she is very good at keeping it on her head.

627
00:38:20,943 --> 00:38:23,443
Wait a sec, don't put it on me yet!

628
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:26,443
Okay, you may place it on my head, the crown, milady.

629
00:38:26,443 --> 00:38:27,743
Here goes.

630
00:38:27,743 --> 00:38:32,443
Thank you. Oh, it's beautiful. Oh, it's not too... my coronation.

631
00:38:33,443 --> 00:38:35,243
Three, two, one, start!

632
00:38:36,343 --> 00:39:05,443
1, 2, 3, 4, 5... 10!

633
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,443
Time's up!

634
00:39:11,443 --> 00:39:13,443
I'm proud of you.

635
00:39:13,943 --> 00:39:18,443
This stupid cup! Stupid cup!

636
00:39:18,943 --> 00:39:20,443
Don't blame the cup.

637
00:39:21,743 --> 00:39:24,443
Maybe my good form will come in handy here.

638
00:39:24,943 --> 00:39:27,443
You may place the tiara on my head.

639
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:29,443
No, you have to step on it first.

640
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:30,943
Oh, come on!

641
00:39:30,943 --> 00:39:33,443
It's the pain before the game! Pain is beauty!

642
00:39:36,943 --> 00:39:39,443
Maybe a wider stance is better. All right, all right, let's do it.

643
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:43,443
I shall place it on top of your crown so you have double crowns.

644
00:39:43,943 --> 00:39:47,943
Okay! Are you ready, cult?

645
00:39:48,943 --> 00:39:49,943
Maybe.

646
00:39:50,243 --> 00:39:51,943
Three, two, one, start!

647
00:39:52,943 --> 00:39:59,443
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

648
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,498
Six!

649
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:02,698
Seven!

650
00:40:03,098 --> 00:40:03,798
Eight!

651
00:40:04,198 --> 00:40:04,898
Nine!

652
00:40:05,298 --> 00:40:06,098
Ten!

653
00:40:06,498 --> 00:40:07,698
Eleven!

654
00:40:07,998 --> 00:40:09,098
Twelve!

655
00:40:09,398 --> 00:40:10,498
Thirteen!

656
00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:11,798
Fourteen!

657
00:40:11,998 --> 00:40:13,298
Fifteen!

658
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:14,798
Sixteen!

659
00:40:15,098 --> 00:40:16,098
Seventeen!

660
00:40:16,398 --> 00:40:17,398
Eighteen!

661
00:40:17,698 --> 00:40:18,698
Nineteen!

662
00:40:18,998 --> 00:40:19,998
Twenty!

663
00:40:20,298 --> 00:40:21,298
Twenty-one!

664
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:22,498
Twenty-two!

665
00:40:22,598 --> 00:40:23,598
Twenty-three!

666
00:40:23,698 --> 00:40:24,698
Twenty-four!

667
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:25,798
Twenty-five!

668
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:30,098
Yes! That's my goal! That was my goal!

669
00:40:30,698 --> 00:40:33,798
Yeah, that's 24! And I didn't lose the cup even once! Sheesh!

670
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,098
You sure? Maybe this cup is not real?

671
00:40:36,398 --> 00:40:38,798
Maybe there was tape! Maybe there was tape that helped her stay there!

672
00:40:39,098 --> 00:40:40,098
No, it's not! No!

673
00:40:42,098 --> 00:40:44,798
Super glue? Was it super glue on her head?

674
00:40:45,098 --> 00:40:49,098
Wait, what's really going on? Let's really test it. Let's really get in there and check it out.

675
00:40:49,298 --> 00:40:50,598
You're gonna use me as the test?

676
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:53,098
It's Zeta's turn!

677
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:57,098
Zeta! Zeta! Yeah!

678
00:40:58,398 --> 00:41:01,598
Directly right in the center of your head, so that it's less likely to fall off.

679
00:41:01,798 --> 00:41:04,098
This is like the best birthday ever!

680
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:06,098
Aw! Yay! I'm glad.

681
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:09,098
Now then, are you ready?

682
00:41:09,698 --> 00:41:12,398
Three, two, one, start!

683
00:41:12,898 --> 00:41:13,698
One!

684
00:41:13,998 --> 00:41:14,798
Two!

685
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:15,898
Three!

686
00:41:16,198 --> 00:41:16,998
Four!

687
00:41:17,298 --> 00:41:18,098
Five!

688
00:41:18,398 --> 00:41:19,198
Six!

689
00:41:19,498 --> 00:41:20,298
Seven!

690
00:41:20,598 --> 00:41:21,398
Eight!

691
00:41:21,698 --> 00:41:22,498
Nine!

692
00:41:22,798 --> 00:41:23,598
Ten!

693
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:24,898
Eleven!

694
00:41:25,198 --> 00:41:26,098
Twelve!

695
00:41:26,398 --> 00:41:27,298
Thirteen!

696
00:41:27,598 --> 00:41:28,498
Fourteen!

697
00:41:28,798 --> 00:41:29,698
Fifteen!

698
00:41:29,998 --> 00:41:30,898
Sixteen!

699
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:32,098
Seventeen!

700
00:41:32,398 --> 00:41:33,298
Eighteen!

701
00:41:33,598 --> 00:41:34,498
Nineteen!

702
00:41:34,798 --> 00:41:35,698
Twenty!

703
00:41:35,998 --> 00:41:36,998
Twenty-one!

704
00:41:37,298 --> 00:41:38,298
Twenty-two!

705
00:41:38,598 --> 00:41:39,598
Twenty-three!

706
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:40,898
Twenty-four!

707
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,198
Twenty-five!

708
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:43,498
Twenty-six!

709
00:41:49,098 --> 00:41:53,098
You did it! 26 is the final number!

710
00:41:54,798 --> 00:41:57,598
Wow! Does that mean the scores are what I think it is?

711
00:41:57,798 --> 00:41:59,098
I think so!

712
00:41:59,298 --> 00:42:00,598
Is anyone keeping the score?

713
00:42:00,798 --> 00:42:02,598
The staff-san has been keeping score for us.

714
00:42:05,098 --> 00:42:08,098
Yay, you're a winner!

715
00:42:09,098 --> 00:42:10,598
I am! I am!

716
00:42:11,598 --> 00:42:14,098
What are the scores again? What matters is what's inside.

717
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,098
Seems like you guys completed the test! Woohoo!

718
00:42:17,598 --> 00:42:21,098
Some of you were able to lift pretty well. Maybe not for some, though.

719
00:42:23,098 --> 00:42:28,098
It was so much fun just watching! But come on, Zeta! You're the birthday girl!

720
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:31,098
You should be showing us your crazy skills or something!

721
00:42:31,598 --> 00:42:33,798
Prove it to us next test, okay?

722
00:42:33,998 --> 00:42:35,398
Well then, thank you for having me!

723
00:42:35,598 --> 00:42:39,098
This is Amelia Watson signing off. Until next time! Bye!

724
00:43:14,798 --> 00:43:16,698
うーっし、お待たせ！ラプラス・ダークネス...
Alright, sorry to keep you waiting! Laplus Darknesss...

725
00:43:17,098 --> 00:43:18,598
よし、あいつ狙おう！
Alright, let's aim for her!

726
00:43:23,398 --> 00:43:26,598
やめてくれー！仲間だろー！
Stop it! We're allies, right?!

727
00:43:26,798 --> 00:43:29,598
よいしょー！よいしょー！
Here we go! Heave-ho!

728
00:43:35,098 --> 00:43:37,098
ダメージだー、ダメージ！
Damage! It's damage!

729
00:43:39,098 --> 00:43:43,098
はい、はい、はい！楽しそう、楽しそう！
Yes, yes, yes! Looks fun, looks fun!

730
00:43:44,798 --> 00:43:46,098
お、ゼータ！
Oh, Zeta!

731
00:43:46,298 --> 00:43:49,098
なになに、何水鉄砲持ってるの？
Wait, why do you have a water gun too?

732
00:43:49,798 --> 00:43:53,098
え、やめっ、やめて！痛い痛い痛い！
Eh, stop! Stop it! It hurts!

733
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,098
わー、やめてやめてやめて！
Whoa, stop it, stop it, stop it!

734
00:44:03,798 --> 00:44:07,098
どういうこと？誰か説明して〜
What's going on? Someone explain!

735
00:44:08,798 --> 00:44:10,598
Bokobokobo~ Kobo Kanaeru at your service!

736
00:44:10,798 --> 00:44:14,098
Let me be your sun to shine your day! Ehe!

737
00:44:14,798 --> 00:44:16,098
Zeta, happy birthday!

738
00:44:16,298 --> 00:44:18,098
ありがとう！
Thank you!

739
00:44:18,798 --> 00:44:23,098
I already told them what to do before you came here, so they know the rules!

740
00:44:23,798 --> 00:44:27,598
We're gonna be testing your aim skills with this water gun!

741
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:32,098
In shooting level 1, we will see how many immobile targets you can hit within 30 seconds!

742
00:44:32,698 --> 00:44:37,098
In level 2, we will see how many moving targets you can hit within 30 seconds!

743
00:44:37,698 --> 00:44:42,098
And level 3 will test if you can hit the targets on the moving zombie!

744
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:46,098
Who do you think is the best shooter here?

745
00:44:46,598 --> 00:44:49,598
俺だ俺だ俺だー！
It's me! Me! Me!

746
00:44:50,198 --> 00:44:54,098
トワたち、みんななんとFPSやってるんでね！
Everyone here, including Towa, plays FPS games!

747
00:44:54,698 --> 00:44:56,098
そうだね。
That's right.

748
00:44:56,798 --> 00:44:59,098
私はやってないけどね。
I don't play them, though.

749
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:01,839
よーし！頑張るぞ！
Alright! I'll do my best!

750
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,239
さあ、誰が勝つんでしょうか、という感じなんですが
Well, it's like, who's going to win?

751
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:06,239
負けませんよ！
I won't lose!

752
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:07,639
私も負けないよ
I won't lose either.

753
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:10,139
Level 1

754
00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:16,639
こちらに動かない的があるので、こちらをみんなで一人ずつ撃っていこうかなと思います
We have stationary targets here, so I think we'll all take turns shooting them.

755
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:17,539
頑張るー！
I'll do my best!

756
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:19,639
順番どうしましょう？
What should we do about the order?

757
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:23,139
1番！1番！やりたい！やりたい！
First! First! I want to go first!

758
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:28,639
まつりちゃんは1番、で。他の3人はね、ここら辺で見てもらいましょう
Matsuri-chan will be first. The other three, let's watch from around here.

759
00:45:29,139 --> 00:45:30,139
はーい
Okay.

760
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:33,139
3, 2, 1, Start!

761
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:35,639
おお！上手！
Oh! Good!

762
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:36,639
うまい
Nice.

763
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:42,339
まつりちゃんパーフェクトおじさんじゃない？
Isn't Matsuri-chan a Perfect Old Man?

764
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,139
パーフェクトおじさんじゃない？
Isn't she a Perfect Old Man?

765
00:45:46,439 --> 00:45:47,739
うますぎる
Too good.

766
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:48,939
やばい、うますぎる
Crazy, too good.

767
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:50,639
残り15秒！
15 seconds left!

768
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:53,639
これ、みんなにはわかんないけど、すげえムズいんだからね、これ
You guys might not know, but this is really hard.

769
00:45:54,139 --> 00:45:55,139
上手、上手、上手
Good, good, good.

770
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:57,139
偏差とかもなしに
Even without lead shooting...

771
00:45:57,639 --> 00:45:58,639
えっ、これ最後？
Wait, is this the last one?

772
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:01,139
えっ、パーフェクト？パーフェクト？
Wait, perfect? Perfect?

773
00:46:01,939 --> 00:46:03,139
おお！まつりちゃん！
Oh! Matsuri-chan!

774
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:11,639
まつりちゃんは1発も外さず、全て取れましたー！
Matsuri-chan didn't miss a single shot and got them all!

775
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:13,139
イエーイ！
Yay!

776
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:14,139
おめでとう！すごい！
Congrats! Amazing!

777
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:15,639
すごすぎる、うますぎるよね
Too amazing, too good, right?

778
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,639
なんかちょっと行きづらいわ
It's a bit hard to follow that.

779
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:18,639
次、私行く
I'll go next.

780
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:19,639
お、マジ？
Oh, really?

781
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:22,139
いや、常闇様でしょ、次
No, it should be Tokoyami-sama next.

782
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:23,639
次、常闇様でしょ、リーダー！
Next is Tokoyami-sama, right, leader!

783
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:24,639
じゃあトワ
Then, Towa.

784
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:26,139
頑張れ！
Good luck!

785
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:30,139
支えるよ、支える感じ行くよ
I'll support it, I'll go with a supporting feel.

786
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:32,139
じゃあ、カウントするよ
Then, I'll count down.

787
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:35,139
3, 2, 1, Start!

788
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,139
おお、速い、速い
Oh, fast, fast.

789
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:44,639
速い！
Fast!

790
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:46,639
大したもんだ
Impressive.

791
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,639
ちょっと待って、どういうこと？
Wait a second, what's going on?

792
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:51,639
うまい、めっちゃ速い
Good, so fast.

793
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:54,639
おー、うまい
Oh, nice.

794
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:57,139
うわー、えー
Whoa, ehh.

795
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:00,139
おめでとうー！
Congrats!

796
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:03,139
だんだん超えてくんだ、これ
They keep getting better.

797
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:05,139
ああ、これは、次どうする？
Ah, this is... who's next?

798
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:07,139
いやー、先にやっとけばよかった
Man, I should have gone earlier.

799
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:11,139
じゃあ、次私やります。とりあえずね
Then, I'll go next. For now.

800
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:14,639
作戦あんだ。下半身作戦
I have a strategy. The lower body strategy.

801
00:47:12,339 --> 00:47:14,139
下半身作戦
Lower Body Strategy

802
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:17,639
下半身を安定させてブレないようにする
Stabilize the lower body to prevent shaking.

803
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:17,139
下半身を安定させる
Stabilize the lower body

804
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:19,139
下半身作戦だと？
Lower body strategy, you say?

805
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:20,639
ポーズだっせぇ！
That pose is lame!

806
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:20,639
ポーズダッセェ！
Pose is lame!

807
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:22,139
ダサすぎる！
Too lame!

808
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:22,139
ダサすぎる！
Too lame!

809
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,139
これでいくから
I'm going with this.

810
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,139
3, 2, 1, Start!

811
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:29,139
頑張れ、頑張れ！
Good luck, good luck!

812
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:31,139
頑張れー！
Good luck!

813
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:33,139
安定させて
Keep it stable.

814
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:35,639
おー、入ってる、入ってる
Oh, she's hitting, she's hitting.

815
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:41,639
いや、適当に打ってるな
No, she's just shooting blindly.

816
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:45,639
あ、でも、惜しい惜しい
Ah, but, close, close.

817
00:47:45,939 --> 00:47:47,139
惜しい、惜しい
Close, close.

818
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:48,939
そらだ、そらに打ってる
It's the sky, she's shooting the sky.

819
00:47:48,939 --> 00:47:50,639
もっと上、もっと上
Higher, higher.

820
00:47:51,139 --> 00:47:54,139
頑張って、頑張って。今のはそらだぞ
Keep trying, keep trying. That was the sky.

821
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:56,139
あー
Ah-

822
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:58,139
Time's up!

823
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:01,639
ラプラスの結果は、まあ、ぼちぼちとなります
La+'s result is, well, so-so.

824
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:03,639
イエーイ！
Yay!

825
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:06,139
最後、行きますか
Shall we go for the last one?

826
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:08,639
行きます！頑張るー！
Let's go! I'll do my best!

827
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:12,139
ということで、じゃあ最後、ゼータ、撃ちやすく
So, finally, Zeta, to make it easier to shoot...

828
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:13,639
1秒で、1秒で
One second, one second.

829
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:15,639
いやいやいや、1秒はダメでしょ
No, no, one second is no good.

830
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:17,639
準備OK、準備OK
Ready, ready.

831
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:17,639
準備OK
Ready

832
00:48:18,139 --> 00:48:21,139
3, 2, 1, Go!

833
00:48:22,339 --> 00:48:24,139
頑張れ、当たった、当たった！
Good luck, it hit, it hit!

834
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:26,139
おー、すごい
Oh, amazing.

835
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:30,139
うまい！えっ、思ったより上手い
Good! Wait, she's better than I thought.

836
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:32,139
うまいよー
I'm good!

837
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:33,639
いや、これは
No, this is...

838
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:35,639
うー、あー
Ugh, ahh.

839
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:40,139
あー、全然余裕余裕
Ah, total piece of cake.

840
00:48:40,139 --> 00:48:41,639
うまい！
Good!

841
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:43,139
あれ？どこだ？どこだ？
Wait, where? Where?

842
00:48:43,639 --> 00:48:45,139
どこ？どこだ？
Where? Where is it?

843
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,139
右下、右下、ここら辺
Bottom right, bottom right, around here.

844
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:49,639
下、下、下、下、下
Bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom.

845
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:52,139
どこにある？どこだ？
Where is it? Where?

846
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,639
えっ、なくなった？
Wait, it's gone?

847
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:56,639
えっ、なくなった
Eh, it's gone.

848
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:57,639
いや、なに、これ？
Wait, what is this?

849
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,139
守護霊？これ
A guardian spirit? Is it this?

850
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:01,139
神様が手伝ってもらったのかな？
Maybe a god helped me?

851
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:02,639
おまかせ！
Leave it to me!

852
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:05,139
どこだ？あれ？
Where is it? Huh?

853
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:05,139
まつり先輩ナイスショット！
Matsuri-senpai Nice Shot!

854
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:08,639
なんかギリギリ滑り込みで、判定はClear!
Somehow, she just barely made it, result is Clear!

855
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:08,639
Clear

856
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:14,139
Level 2

857
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:16,139
あちらをご覧ください！
Please look over there!

858
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:18,639
はい！動いてる！
Yes! They're moving!

859
00:49:21,139 --> 00:49:23,139
さあ、頑張っていきましょう！
Alright, let's do our best!

860
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:25,139
じゃあ、誰からいく？
So, who's going first?

861
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:27,639
俺だ、俺だ、俺だ！
Me, me, me!

862
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:29,139
私もいきたい！
I want to go too!

863
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:32,639
むずかしくなっちゃう、どんどん
It's getting harder and harder.

864
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,139
もう行っちゃったから、ラプラス行っちゃったからね
She's already gone, La+ has already gone out there.

865
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,639
いいんだ
It's fine.

866
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:38,639
やったもん勝ちでやばい
First come, first served, that's crazy.

867
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:41,639
では、いきましょう。ラプラス、いきますよ
Then, let's go. La+, here we go.

868
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:43,139
3, 2, 1, Start!

869
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:45,639
このゲームには必勝法がある
This game has a winning strategy.

870
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:45,639
このゲームには必勝法がある
This game has a winning strategy

871
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:47,639
めっちゃ回っとるやん
She's spinning so much.

872
00:49:48,139 --> 00:49:49,639
うわー！
Whoa!

873
00:49:50,139 --> 00:49:52,639
ねえ、これ、ずるい！
Hey, this is cheating!

874
00:49:53,139 --> 00:49:54,639
うしろから撃ってるのヤバイって
Shooting from behind is crazy.

875
00:49:53,139 --> 00:49:54,639
うしろから撃ってるのヤバイって
Shooting from behind is crazy

876
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:57,139
当たってないよ、当たってない
You're not hitting, you're not hitting.

877
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:57,139
当たってないよ
You're not hitting

878
00:49:58,139 --> 00:49:59,639
ちゃんと見て
Look properly.

879
00:50:01,427 --> 00:50:02,427
撃て！撃て！
Shoot! Shoot!

880
00:50:02,427 --> 00:50:03,927
撃て撃て撃て！
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

881
00:50:03,927 --> 00:50:05,427
ぐるんぐるんだからカメラ。
The camera is spinning around.

882
00:50:07,927 --> 00:50:08,927
あと5秒しかないよ！
Only 5 seconds left!

883
00:50:09,427 --> 00:50:10,927
一個しか倒してないよ！
You've only knocked down one!

884
00:50:10,927 --> 00:50:12,427
頑張れ！頑張れ！
Go for it! Good luck!

885
00:50:14,427 --> 00:50:14,927
Time's up!

886
00:50:14,927 --> 00:50:16,427
あのね、すごいよ1個。
Hey, one is actually amazing.

887
00:50:16,427 --> 00:50:17,427
1個ってどれ？
Which one was it?

888
00:50:17,427 --> 00:50:18,927
あの後ろ向きでね。
The one that was facing backward.

889
00:50:18,927 --> 00:50:19,927
ゼータいきたい？
Zeta, do you want to go?

890
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:21,927
あ、いきたい、いきたい！
Ah, I want to! I want to!

891
00:50:22,427 --> 00:50:24,427
はい、じゃあゼータいきましょう。
Okay, then let's have Zeta go.

892
00:50:24,427 --> 00:50:25,927
頑張れゼータくん！
Good luck, Zeta-kun!

893
00:50:26,927 --> 00:50:29,427
ラプラスみたいに後ろ向かなくていい？
I don't have to face backward like La+?

894
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:31,427
うん、大丈夫。
Yeah, you're fine.

895
00:50:31,927 --> 00:50:34,427
ゼータの挑戦、いきましょう！
Zeta's challenge, let's go!

896
00:50:34,927 --> 00:50:37,927
3, 2, 1, Start!

897
00:50:38,427 --> 00:50:39,427
Start!

898
00:50:38,927 --> 00:50:40,427
頑張れ！
Good luck!

899
00:50:42,927 --> 00:50:44,427
当たった！当たった！
It hit! It hit!

900
00:50:45,427 --> 00:50:46,427
むず！
Hard!

901
00:50:46,427 --> 00:50:47,927
もう来るからね！
It's coming already!

902
00:50:48,427 --> 00:50:50,427
いやもう終わってるんだけど私が。
Wait, I'm already finished.

903
00:50:51,427 --> 00:50:53,427
終わってる終わってる！ゼータもう終わってる。
She's finished, finished! Zeta is already done.

904
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:56,427
裏…裏面だったな。
The back... it was the back side.

905
00:50:57,427 --> 00:50:59,927
裏面だとダメなのか。そうダメ。
Is the back side no good? Yeah, it's no good.

906
00:51:00,427 --> 00:51:02,427
やばい、ゼータ後ろ！
Crap, Zeta, behind you!

907
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:06,427
これはもう後ろ、後ろしかない！
This is already just the back, only the back side!

908
00:51:09,427 --> 00:51:09,927
Time's up!

909
00:51:10,927 --> 00:51:14,427
ということで残念、ゼータ0枚です！
And so, unfortunately, Zeta got zero!

910
00:51:14,427 --> 00:51:18,427
めちゃめちゃ難しい！これむずいよ。
This is super difficult! It's really hard.

911
00:51:18,927 --> 00:51:20,427
でも惜しかったのあったね。
But there were some close ones.

912
00:51:20,927 --> 00:51:22,427
裏がやばい、裏が。
The back side is the problem, the back.

913
00:51:22,427 --> 00:51:24,927
裏面だったからすごい惜しい。
Since it was the back side, it was very close.

914
00:51:25,427 --> 00:51:28,427
最後やから、まつりいかせてください。
Since it's the last one, please let Matsuri go.

915
00:51:28,927 --> 00:51:31,427
もういっちゃった、もういっちゃった。
She's already gone, she's already gone.

916
00:51:32,927 --> 00:51:34,927
まつり先輩いくぞ！
Matsuri-senpai, let's go!

917
00:51:34,927 --> 00:51:37,427
3, 2, 1, Go!

918
00:51:37,927 --> 00:51:38,927
Start!

919
00:51:39,427 --> 00:51:40,927
うま！マジ？
Skillful! Really?

920
00:51:42,927 --> 00:51:45,427
惜しい！今のダメなんだ。
Close! That one was no good?

921
00:51:46,427 --> 00:51:47,927
おお、うま！
Oh, skillful!

922
00:51:49,427 --> 00:51:50,927
2個目！
Second one!

923
00:51:51,427 --> 00:51:54,427
今のところ最高だよ、これ。
This is the best so far.

924
00:51:54,927 --> 00:51:56,927
2個の時点でね。
With two hits already.

925
00:51:57,927 --> 00:51:59,927
むずいんだからこれ。
Because this is hard.

926
00:52:00,927 --> 00:52:03,427
撃ちとるうちにどんどん時間が過ぎてく！
Time keeps passing as I shoot!

927
00:52:03,927 --> 00:52:05,927
これ後ろじゃない？後ろ！
Isn't this the back side? The back!

928
00:52:06,927 --> 00:52:07,927
後ろはね、もうあの…
The back is already, well...

929
00:52:08,427 --> 00:52:08,927
Time's up!

930
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:12,927
残念です！2個か…
Too bad! Two hits...

931
00:52:13,927 --> 00:52:16,927
でも2個でもすごいよ。1だったよね？
But even two is amazing. It was one before, right?

932
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,427
これ気づいたぞ私。
I've realized something.

933
00:52:22,427 --> 00:52:24,427
追わない方がいい。
It's better not to chase them.

934
00:52:23,927 --> 00:52:25,927
絶対そう！トワも思ってた。
Definitely! Towa thought so too.

935
00:52:25,927 --> 00:52:29,427
一点集中で来たところパーンのほうがいいね。
It's better to focus on one point and hit them when they come.

936
00:52:30,427 --> 00:52:32,427
アドバイスを活かしてやろうかな。
I guess I'll make use of that advice.

937
00:52:32,427 --> 00:52:35,427
トワ様の挑戦！ 3, 2, 1, Go!
Towa-sama's challenge! 3, 2, 1, Go!

938
00:52:36,427 --> 00:52:37,427
Start!

939
00:52:38,427 --> 00:52:40,427
頑張れ！おおい！
Good luck! Whoa!

940
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:45,427
やばい、こっち向け！やばい！
Crap, look this way! Crap!

941
00:52:45,927 --> 00:52:47,927
ええ、いくね！
Whoa, she's going for it!

942
00:52:48,427 --> 00:52:49,927
裏だ！裏！
It's the back! The back!

943
00:52:50,927 --> 00:52:52,427
頑張れ！
Good luck!

944
00:52:53,427 --> 00:52:55,427
うお、当たった当たった当たった！

00:52:56,427 --> 00:52:58,427
あと10秒！頑張れ！
10 seconds left! Good luck!

946
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:01,427
タイミングがタイミングだよ！
The timing is everything!

947
00:53:01,427 --> 00:53:04,427
お、全部裏です！
Oh, they're all the back side!

948
00:53:05,927 --> 00:53:06,927
まずい！
Crap!

949
00:53:07,427 --> 00:53:07,927
Time's up!

950
00:53:09,927 --> 00:53:12,427
難しいんだよ！2個です！
It's so hard! Two hits!

951
00:53:12,927 --> 00:53:14,927
え、これクソむずい！一番でした。
Wait, this is so damn hard! That was the best one.

952
00:53:15,427 --> 00:53:17,927
一緒だ、トワさん。一緒っすよ。
We're the same, Towa-san. Same score.

953
00:53:18,427 --> 00:53:21,427
後ろ向いてるやつ、申し訳ないけど後ろの人と一緒。本当に。
I'm sorry, but that backward-facing one is really just like the person behind it.

954
00:53:21,927 --> 00:53:23,427
Level 3

955
00:53:24,427 --> 00:53:27,927
普通の的、動く的と来て、なんとこちら！ドーン！
After normal targets and moving targets, look at this! Boom!

956
00:53:32,427 --> 00:53:33,927
ゾンビだ！
It's a zombie!

957
00:53:33,927 --> 00:53:38,427
次はゾンビの、あの動く的になってます。
Next is this zombie-style moving target.

958
00:53:39,927 --> 00:53:42,427
でも的自体は2個しかないから。
But there are only two targets on it.

959
00:53:42,927 --> 00:53:46,427
こちらを狙って。なんか気持ち悪いポーズもしてますけど。
Aim for these. It's making some gross poses though.

960
00:53:47,927 --> 00:53:50,427
どれどれ？トワちんからじゃあ行きましょう！
Let's see... then let's start with Towa-chin!

ごめん！イージー、イージー、イージー！
Sorry! Easy, easy, easy!

965
00:54:00,927 --> 00:54:03,427
え、でもなんか…おい、こっち向け！
Wait, but something... hey, look this way!

966
00:54:03,927 --> 00:54:06,427
やばい！いやちょっと待って！
Crap! No, wait a minute!

967
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:09,427

頑張れ！代われよ！
Good luck! Change poses already!

970
00:54:15,927 --> 00:54:18,427
やばいやばい！動くんだけど！
Crap, crap! It keeps moving!

971
00:54:18,927 --> 00:54:21,427
いや、そ…やばいなんかポーズが！
No, it... crap, the pose!

972
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:24,427
よっしゃ、当たった！
Alright, I hit it!

973
00:54:25,427 --> 00:54:26,427
Clear

974
00:54:26,927 --> 00:54:29,927
ギリ！ギリクリア！すごいギリギリだった。
Barely! Barely cleared it! That was really close.

975
00:54:30,427 --> 00:54:33,427
2つ取れました！ありがとうございます！
I got two! Thank you very much!

976
00:54:35,427 --> 00:54:40,427
なんかゾンビだがたまに自我を持ち始めて不思議な動きをするので皆さま注意を
The zombie occasionally begins to gain a sense of self and performs mysterious movements, so everyone please be careful.

977
00:54:41,427 --> 00:54:43,927
いきたい、いきたい！じゃあまつりちゃんだね。
I want to go! Okay, then it's Matsuri-chan's turn.

978
00:54:44,427 --> 00:54:47,427
頑張るぞ！まつりちゃん！ 3, 2, 1, どうぞ！
I'll do my best! Matsuri-chan! 3, 2, 1, Go!

979
00:54:49,427 --> 00:54:50,427
Start!

980
00:54:48,927 --> 00:54:50,927
はや！はや！
Fast! So fast!

981
00:54:53,427 --> 00:54:55,427
ええ、はやっぷ！
Whoa, so fast!

982
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:58,427
クリア！3秒で終わりました。
Clear! I finished in 3 seconds.

983
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:58,427
Clear

984
00:54:58,927 --> 00:55:00,427
3秒！3秒じゃな…

985
00:55:02,168 --> 00:55:03,168
あー！
Ahhh!

00:55:03,168 --> 00:55:04,668

あ、これまずい！閉じ込めてる！

988
00:55:07,268 --> 00:55:11,268
これまずいよこれ！あー！やっちゃったやっちゃった！まずいよこれ！
This is bad! Ahhh! I did it, I did it! This is bad!

989
00:55:11,468 --> 00:55:15,668
今まつりちゃんが3秒で打ち抜いちゃったということは...
Since Matsuri-chan just shot it down in 3 seconds...

990
00:55:15,668 --> 00:55:19,468
...あの多分もう次ゾンビはこの動きしちゃいけないなっていうふうになって...
...the zombie probably realized it shouldn't move like that anymore...

991
00:55:19,568 --> 00:55:21,568
えー！やばい、学習するタイプだ！
What?! Oh no, it's the type that learns!

992
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,668
学習しています！
It's learning!

993
00:55:22,668 --> 00:55:23,968
学習ゾンビなんだ！
It's a learning zombie!

994
00:55:23,968 --> 00:55:25,668
ちょっと待って、じゃあ次ラプ様？先にやる？
Wait a minute, so next is Lap-sama? Wanna go first?

やっぱ主役が最後でしょ！
The star should go last, after all!

00:55:31,668 --> 00:55:34,168
3, 2, 1, Go!

998
00:55:34,168 --> 00:55:35,168

やばいちょっと途中我慢できなかった...
Oh no, I couldn't hold back halfway through...
