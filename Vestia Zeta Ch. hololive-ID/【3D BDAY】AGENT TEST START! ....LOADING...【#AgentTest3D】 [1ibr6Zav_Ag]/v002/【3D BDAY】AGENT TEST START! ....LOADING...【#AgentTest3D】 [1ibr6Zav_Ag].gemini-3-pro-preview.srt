00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,200
Wait... This is good... I did it...

3
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,800
I infiltrated this place...

4
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Success!

5
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
大成功じゃ！
Great success!

6
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,800
あ、みんなに見られた。
Ah, everyone saw me.

7
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,800
I can't believe you guys were watching me this whole time!

8
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,200
No!

9
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,200
To be honest... mmm, I did feel... mmm, I did feel eyes on me...

10
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,500
But... mmm... I... I knew you guys were watching, it's okay.

11
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,500
Anyways, it's not the time to be talking about that, because...

12
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,100
Today is a special day for the... for me! Yeah!

13
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,200
Today is... do you know what today is? Say it, say it!

14
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,900
Don't be shy, say it!

15
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,200
Yeah! Today is my birthday!

16
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,000
Happy Birthday Zeta~

17
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,100
Happy Birthday Zeta~

18
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,500
Selamat Ulang Tahun~
Happy Birthday~

19
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,500
Gitu ga sih lagunya? I don't know.
Is that how the song goes? I don't know.

20
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Oh? What? You're saying something? Huh?

21
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,500
Mmm... Noob? Skill... Skill issue?

22
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,500
You're saying I'm a noob as a secret agent?

23
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,400
Bulls... Okay, I can't say the word. Bulls.

24
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,100
Your lies... You're lying! That can't be true.

25
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,500
I've been working hard. I've got the stamina...

26
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,200
And obviously the intelligence... IQ... IQ二百。
And obviously the intelligence... IQ... IQ 200.

27
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,500
And strength. You know? Like the power as well. Yeah yeah yeah.

28
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,500
So anyways, don't you worry because I've got the perfect thing for today.

29
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,500
Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Have you ever heard of a... ummm...

30
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,800
Of a... of a secret agent school?

31
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,100
Yeah, so... uh, back in my days...

32
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,800
I've been through hell and back, so I invited some transfer students here...

33
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,500
So we can prove that I'm the best secret agent, okay?

34
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,100
So, mmm, we're gonna do some tests together to see...

35
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,500
How tough it is to become a professional secret agent like me.

36
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,500
Like me, like me. Like me! I'm a good example.

37
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,400
Anyways, it reminds me of my... old... 学校... um... you know?
Anyways, it reminds me of my... old... school... um... you know?

38
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,500
But... to be honest... mmm... to be honest... I did feel... mmm...

39
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,200
To be honest, I don't know what we'll be doing yet, but...

40
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,200
Wait. Oh crap. Okay. It's almost time for the first test.

41
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,500
最初のテストが... そろそろ... は... 早く行かないと！
The first test is... almost... I... I gotta go quick!

42
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,100
Bye!

43
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,500
来るなー！
Don't come!

44
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:02,188
あれ？なんか…
Huh? Something...

45
00:05:02,188 --> 00:05:02,988
なんかさ…
Something like...

46
00:05:02,988 --> 00:05:06,388
なんかみこちのカマキリの威嚇ポーズにビビってる！
It's scared of Mikochi's mantis intimidation pose!

47
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:07,988
ビビった？ビビった？
Scared? You scared?

48
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:10,488
あ、ビビってるビビってる！
Ah, it's scared, it's scared!

49
00:05:10,488 --> 00:05:11,388
あれ？
Huh?

50
00:05:11,388 --> 00:05:13,188
これ、みこちゃん分かりました。
Miko-chan has figured this out.

51
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,188
こいつ、雑魚ゾンビです。
This guy is a small-fry zombie.

52
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:17,688
ざぁ〜こ♡
Sma~ll-fry~ <3

53
00:05:17,688 --> 00:05:19,288
ざぁ〜こ♡
Sma~ll-fry~ <3

54
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:21,388
こいつドMかもしれない！
This guy might be a huge masochist!

55
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,688
ドM？！
A masochist?!

56
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:23,988
みこ向け？みこ向け？
Suitable for Miko? For Miko?

57
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:26,388
ポンコツ〜♡
Useless~ <3

58
00:05:26,388 --> 00:05:28,388
あ、効いてる効いてる！
Ah, it's working, it's working!

59
00:05:28,388 --> 00:05:29,888
珍しく効いてる。
Unusually, it's working.

60
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:32,388
ちょっとよわよわゾンビさんなんじゃない？
Isn't this a bit of a weakling zombie?

61
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:34,888
全然怖くないんですけど〜！
It's not scary at all though~!

62
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:36,688
余裕かも〜！
Might be easy~!

63
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:38,388
うぇ〜い！
Ya~y!

64
00:05:38,388 --> 00:05:40,888
うぇ〜い！
Ya~y!

65
00:05:43,388 --> 00:05:44,588
みんな〜！
Everyone~!

66
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:45,888
あ！ゼータ！
Ah! Zeta!

67
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,388
遅れてごめん〜！
Sorry I'm late~!

68
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,888
ヤッホー！
Yahoo!

69
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:50,688
お誕生日おめでとう！
Happy Birthday!

70
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:52,388
なにこのゾンビ？
What's with this zombie?

71
00:05:52,388 --> 00:05:53,888
あれはよわよわゾンビさんで…
That is a weakling zombie and...

72
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:55,688
よわよわゾンビがいる〜！
There's a weakling zombie~!

73
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,888
レジェンドスクールの最初のテストにお招きしたけど…
I was invited to the first test of Legend School but...

74
00:05:59,888 --> 00:06:02,188
ゾンビも新入生なのかな？
Is the zombie a new student too?

75
00:06:02,188 --> 00:06:03,688
新入生？！
New student?!

76
00:06:03,688 --> 00:06:04,888
大丈夫なの？
Is it okay?

77
00:06:04,888 --> 00:06:08,388
そうなんだ。でも言葉通じないけどさ、ゾンビに。
Is that so? But language doesn't get through to zombies.

78
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:11,388
ゼータは言葉、いろんな言葉話せるよね？
Zeta can speak many languages, right?

79
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:13,688
ゾンビ語も喋れるんじゃないの？
Can't you speak Zombie language too?

80
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:14,688
そっち？！
That way?!

81
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:16,388
任せて任せて！
Leave it to me, leave it to me!

82
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:17,888
おけおけおけ！
Okay okay okay!

83
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:19,888
う〜あ〜あ〜…
Oo... ah... ah...

84
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:21,888
ちょっと弱そうかも。
Sounds a bit weak maybe.

85
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:23,888
え、会話してる？
Eh, are they conversing?

86
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:26,388
よし！出来た！
Alright! I did it!

87
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:27,388
出来た？！
You did it?!

88
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:28,588
おい！ゾンビ！
Oi! Zombie!

89
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:29,888
何してるの！
What are you doing!

90
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:31,888
怖がらせろって言ったでしょ！
I told you to be scary!

91
00:06:31,888 --> 00:06:32,888
オリーちゃんだ！
It's Ollie-chan!

92
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:34,388
I told you to be scary, right?!

93
00:06:34,388 --> 00:06:35,688
What have you been doing?!

94
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:37,388
怒ってる怒ってる！
She's angry, she's angry!

95
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:38,388
Apologies.

96
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:40,888
I probably sent over the weak zombies.

97
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:42,888
Sorry about that.

98
00:06:42,888 --> 00:06:43,888
Anyways,

99
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:46,188
I called you guys here for a surprise test

100
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:49,188
to see if you guys are fit to be a secret agent.

101
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:50,888
なるほどね。
I see.

102
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:54,688
なんか分かんないけどウケる。
I don't really get it but it's funny.

103
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:56,888
なんか分かんないけど受けてみるか。
I don't really get it but let's take the test.

104
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:57,888
受けてみよう！
Let's take it!

105
00:06:57,888 --> 00:07:00,188
Okay, okay, calm down everyone.

106
00:07:00,188 --> 00:07:03,188
In this test, you will need to guess what is inside the box!

107
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:06,888
では、この箱の中身を当ててもらうテストになります！
So, this will be a test to guess what is inside this box!

108
00:07:06,888 --> 00:07:07,888
箱の中身〜？！
Inside the box~?!

109
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:10,388
This requires your investigative skills.

110
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,888
これはあなたたちの推理力が試されます。
This will test your deductive reasoning.

111
00:07:11,888 --> 00:07:13,688
For round 1,

112
00:07:13,688 --> 00:07:16,888
you can feel the object for 30 seconds only.

113
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:18,388
Have fun.

114
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:20,388
Can't wait to see your reactions.

115
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:24,888
いいリアクション期待してるよだって。
She says she expects good reactions.

116
00:07:24,888 --> 00:07:26,388
完全に理解してるから。
I completely understand.

117
00:07:28,388 --> 00:07:29,888
じゃあ、AZKi先輩からかな？
Then, starting with AZKi-senpai?

118
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:30,888
分かりました。
Understood.

119
00:07:30,888 --> 00:07:31,688
頑張ります。
I'll do my best.

120
00:07:31,688 --> 00:07:32,888
頑張って〜！
Good luck~!

121
00:07:32,888 --> 00:07:34,688
これ、みんなで協力してだよね？
We're doing this together, right?

122
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,388
まぁそうね。情報を集めよう。
Well, yes. Let's gather information.

123
00:07:37,388 --> 00:07:39,888
伝えることに集中したいと思います。
I'll focus on conveying what I feel.

124
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:45,888
Three, Two, One...

125
00:07:45,888 --> 00:07:46,688
Start!

126
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:47,888
おお〜！
Ooh~!

127
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:48,888
え？これ…
Eh? This...

128
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:50,888
え、コードのような…
Eh, like a cord...

129
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:51,888
コード？
Cord?

130
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,888
なんだこれ？え、ちょっと待って。
What is this? Eh, wait a minute.

131
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:55,888
え、なんか、ジタバタしてます。
Eh, something is flailing.

132
00:07:55,888 --> 00:07:56,688
ジタバタ？！
Flailing?!

133
00:07:56,688 --> 00:07:57,888
動いてる！動いてるよ！
It's moving! It's moving!

134
00:07:57,888 --> 00:07:59,388
怖っ！何？
Scary! What?

135
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:00,888
え、なんか動いているけど…
Eh, it's moving though...

136
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:01,888
Time's up!

137
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:03,888
なんか足がバタバタしてるみたいな。
It feels like legs flapping around.

138
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:04,888
やばい！
Oh no!

139
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:06,388
変な機械なんじゃないの？
Isn't it some strange machine?

140
00:08:06,388 --> 00:08:09,388
なんか、足がバタバタしてるみたいな感覚…
It feels like legs are flapping around...

141
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,888
え〜！やばい！
Ehh! That's bad!

142
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:15,388
じゃあ、ミオちゃん！
Then, Mio-chan!

143
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:17,388
Start!

144
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:18,388
ほら！
Here goes!

145
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:22,888
お！お！お！お！
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

146
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:23,888
怖い怖い怖い！
Scary scary scary!

147
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:27,388
は！なんか… は！あ！あ！
Hah! Something... Hah! Ah! Ah!

148
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:30,388
でも分かったかもこれウチ。
But I might have figured it out.

149
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:31,388
え？分かった？
Eh? You figured it out?

150
00:08:31,388 --> 00:08:33,888
ああ、なるほど。はいはいはい。
Ah, I see. Yes yes yes.

151
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,888
ああ、元気ですね。
Ah, it's energetic, isn't it.

152
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:36,888
元気？！
Energetic?!

153
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:37,888
元気元気。

311
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:33,444
やだな、濡れてるっていう前情報で嫌だ。
I hate the prior info that it's wet.

312
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:34,944
濡れてるよ。
It IS wet.

313
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:36,444
あー！やっぱ濡れてるな！
Aah! It really is wet!

314
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:37,944
濡れてる？
Wet?

315
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:38,944
濡れてる。
It's wet.

316
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,444
あー、おっと、濡れてる！
Ah, oh, it's wet!

317
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:43,944
濡れてるけど…
It's wet but...

318
00:19:43,944 --> 00:19:46,444
なんか硬くて…
It's sort of hard...

319
00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:48,444
下にたくさんいる！
There are many of them below!

320
00:19:48,444 --> 00:19:49,944
いっぱいいるんだよ！
There's a lot, right!

321
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:51,444
たくさんいるぞ！
There are many!

322
00:19:51,444 --> 00:19:52,944
なんだ、これ？
What is this?

323
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:57,444
え、これでさ、あんまり見かけないやつの気がする。
Eh, I feel like I don't see this kind of thing often.

324
00:19:57,444 --> 00:19:58,444
見かけない？
You don't see it?

325
00:19:58,444 --> 00:19:59,944
見かけない？
Uncommon?

326
00:20:07,532 --> 00:20:08,832
むずいんだ！
It's difficult!

327
00:20:09,032 --> 00:20:09,832
出た！
I did it!

328
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:10,532
行こう！
Let's go!

329
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:12,132
頑張るゼータ！
I'll do my best zeta!

330
00:20:12,432 --> 00:20:13,432
それでは…
Well then...

331
00:20:13,932 --> 00:20:16,932
ベスティア・ゼータの挑戦
Vestia Zeta's Challenge

332
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,132
スタート！
Start!

333
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:20,732
うわ！おお！
Whoa! Oh!

334
00:20:21,932 --> 00:20:23,432
うわ！あー！
Whoa! Ah!

335
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:26,432
あ、OK、OK。OK。
Ah, OK, OK. OK.

336
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:27,932
早い！わかったかも。
Fast! I might know what it is.

337
00:20:29,732 --> 00:20:32,432
我々はあんまり馴染みないけど…
We aren't very familiar with it, but...

338
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,132
ゼータは馴染みあるの？
Is Zeta familiar with it?

339
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,132
馴染みがある、もしかしたら。
I might be familiar with it, possibly.

340
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:39,132
これいっぱい触ったことあるかも。
I might have touched this a lot.

341
00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:40,432
馴染み深い？
Very familiar?

342
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:42,132
馴染み深いんだよ、きっと。
It's surely familiar.

343
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:43,732
ゼータにとっては。
For Zeta, at least.

344
00:20:45,432 --> 00:20:47,432
我々にしたらちょっと難しいかも。
For us, it might be a bit difficult.

345
00:20:48,132 --> 00:20:48,932
Time's up!

346
00:20:48,932 --> 00:20:50,432
イエーイ！OK！
Yay! OK!

347
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:53,732
これはね…うんうんうん。
This is... yeah yeah yeah.

348
00:20:55,932 --> 00:20:57,432
おそらくこれは…
Probably this is...

349
00:20:57,732 --> 00:20:59,132
ウニの仲間。
A friend of sea urchins.

350
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:00,432
ウニ！？
Sea urchin?!

351
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:03,132
あずきの答えは…
AZKi's answer is...

352
00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:04,132
苔。
Moss.

353
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:07,432
なんかちょっとずついっぱい生えている感じ。
It feels like a lot of little things growing.

354
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,132
でも確かに湿ってたしね。
But it was certainly damp.

355
00:21:09,732 --> 00:21:10,932
うちの答えは…
My answer is...

356
00:21:10,932 --> 00:21:11,932
ライチ。
Lychee.

357
00:21:13,432 --> 00:21:15,932
ゼータはね、多分…
Zeta thinks, probably...

358
00:21:17,432 --> 00:21:20,732
インドネシア果物と近いかも。
It might be close to an Indonesian fruit.

359
00:21:21,432 --> 00:21:23,432
いっぱいトゲトゲを…
Lots of spikes...

360
00:21:24,932 --> 00:21:25,932
なんていう食べ物？
What's the food called?

361
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:27,932
名前はランブータン。
The name is Rambutan.

362
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:29,432
ランブータン？
Rambutan?

363
00:21:31,432 --> 00:21:33,732
でもわかんない、ここにはランブータンいないのかな。
But I don't know if Rambutan exists here.

364
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:36,932
自信持っていこう。
Let's be confident.

365
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:38,932
ゼータが一番わかってたよ。
Zeta understood it the best.

366
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:40,432
一番自信あったじゃん。
She had the most confidence.

367
00:21:42,432 --> 00:21:43,732
じゃあそれでいきましょうよ。
Then let's go with that.

368
00:21:43,932 --> 00:21:45,432
答えは、せーの…
The answer is, one two...

369
00:21:45,432 --> 00:21:46,932
ランブータン！
Rambutan!

370
00:21:49,432 --> 00:21:51,432
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!

371
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:52,932
Correct answer!

372
00:21:52,932 --> 00:21:55,932
やったー！すごい！
Yay! Amazing!

373
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:03,432
ちょっと待って、うちライチとか言ったけど…
Wait a minute, I said Lychee but...

374
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:04,432
全然違うわ。
It's totally different.

375
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:05,732
何これ！？
What is this?!

376
00:22:06,432 --> 00:22:07,932
ライチの味がするかも。
It might taste like Lychee.

377
00:22:07,932 --> 00:22:09,432
味は似てる。
The taste is similar.

378
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,732
初めて見た。
I've never seen it before.

379
00:22:11,932 --> 00:22:13,432
甘いの？
Is it sweet?

380
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:17,432
ちょっと甘っぽい。
It's a little sweet-ish.

381
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:25,932
There seems to have been correct and incorrect answers.

382
00:22:26,932 --> 00:22:27,932
But...

383
00:22:28,132 --> 00:22:29,132
Zeta!

384
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:33,732
It seems like your investigative skills are not quite up to par yet.

385
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:35,932
You need to work harder.

386
00:22:35,932 --> 00:22:37,932
Or, in other words...

387
00:22:37,932 --> 00:22:39,432
SKILL ISSUE!

388
00:22:39,932 --> 00:22:42,932
Skill issue ってどういうこと！？
What do you mean 'skill issue'?!

389
00:22:42,932 --> 00:22:45,432
見て、スキルが問題のゼータだよ！
Look, it's Zeta with the skill issue!

390
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:47,732
She's getting mad!

391
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:48,732
あっ、怒っちゃった！
Ah, she got mad!

392
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:49,732
Oh dear!

393
00:22:49,932 --> 00:22:51,932
Wow, you can't even solve that!

394
00:22:51,932 --> 00:22:53,932
まったく、こんなのも解けないなんて！
Geez, to think you can't even solve this!

395
00:22:54,932 --> 00:22:56,432
Everyone else, you did great!

396
00:22:56,732 --> 00:22:57,732
みんな、よくやったわ！
Everyone, you did well!

397
00:22:57,932 --> 00:22:59,732
Good luck on the next test!

398
00:23:01,932 --> 00:23:02,932
See y'all!

399
00:23:02,932 --> 00:23:03,932
またね！
See ya!

400
00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:07,932
え、ゼータも頑張ったのにな。
Eh, but Zeta did her best too.

401
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,932
さっき笑ったの？
Did you just laugh?

402
00:23:16,932 --> 00:23:18,432
ちょっとナメてたね。
It was underestimating us.

403
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:19,932
笑ってんじゃねえよ！
Don't you be laughing!

404
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,432
笑ってんじゃねえお前！
Don't you laugh, you!

405
00:23:25,932 --> 00:23:27,432
弱い者いじめすんな！
Don't bully the weak!

406
00:23:27,932 --> 00:23:29,432
かわいそう！
Poor thing!

407
00:23:30,432 --> 00:23:31,432
あずき様！？
AZKi-sama?!

408
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:34,432
優しそう！
She looks kind!

409
00:23:34,432 --> 00:23:37,132
もっと、床に這いつくばりなさい。
Crawl on the floor more.

410
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:39,432
あずき様ー！
AZKi-sama!

411
00:23:41,432 --> 00:23:42,932
ありがとね、みんな来てくれて。
Thanks everyone for coming.

412
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,132
誕生日おめでとう！
Happy Birthday!

413
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:49,432
ありがとう！
Thank you!

414
00:23:56,932 --> 00:23:59,132
次のテストの時間だから、行ってくるね！
It's time for the next test, so I'm going!

415
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:00,432
頑張れー！
Good luck!

416
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:02,132
バイバーイ！
Bye bye!

417
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:11,432
ゾンビ、もっと祝いなさいよ。
Zombie, celebrate more.

418
00:24:11,732 --> 00:24:13,432
ゼータを祝って！
Celebrate Zeta!

419
00:24:21,932 --> 00:24:23,932
Wait, there's like a ring.

420
00:24:23,932 --> 00:24:25,932
Wait, is this like a boxing ring?

421
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,432
Wait, what am I gonna have to do here?

422
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:30,932
No way. Are we gonna have to fight?

423
00:24:31,432 --> 00:24:33,432
I'm not good at fighting though.

424
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,132
I mean I can try, but...

425
00:24:36,932 --> 00:24:38,132
Happy birthday, Zeta!

426
00:24:38,132 --> 00:24:39,432
Long time no see.

427
00:24:39,932 --> 00:24:41,432
This is Amelia Watson.

428
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:45,132
hololive EN's number one time-traveling detective!

429
00:24:45,432 --> 00:24:46,432
How've you been?

430
00:24:46,432 --> 00:24:47,732
I've been good!

431
00:24:47,732 --> 00:24:48,932
How are you?

432
00:24:49,432 --> 00:24:51,432
Ah, glad to see you're doing well!

433
00:24:51,932 --> 00:24:53,432
Yeah. I prepared the second test.

434
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:56,432
But we also have other transfer students.

435
00:24:56,932 --> 00:24:58,132
Let's call them in now!

436
00:24:58,432 --> 00:25:01,432
Don't let the first contestant's size fool you!

437
00:25:02,453 --> 00:25:05,613
People tremble when they hear her name and her infamous line!

438
00:25:05,613 --> 00:25:07,913
"Small but mighty, always rock hard."

439
00:25:07,913 --> 00:25:09,213
"I'm rocking in!"

440
00:25:09,513 --> 00:25:12,313
Please welcome... Koseki Bijou!

441
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:15,613
Koseki Bijou!

442
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:23,513
Happy birthday Zeta!

443
00:25:23,913 --> 00:25:26,713
Today I'm rock hard just for you.

444
00:25:27,913 --> 00:25:31,413
KOSEKI BIJOU

445
00:25:33,213 --> 00:25:35,513
Coming to the ring, she's the hero we didn't ask for,

446
00:25:35,513 --> 00:25:37,413
but somehow still believe in!

447
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:38,913
She's everyone's last hope.

448
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,613
Because all the good ones were busy!

449
00:25:41,513 --> 00:25:42,813
Her line is:

450
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:46,013
"Meet your end, and... despair!"

451
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:47,413
"Haiyah!"

452
00:26:03,413 --> 00:26:05,413
Happy birthday Zeta!

453
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:07,313
I'm taking you down!

454
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:08,913
Down... under.

455
00:26:06,613 --> 00:26:10,413
IRyS

456
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:12,913
Ladies and gentlemen!

457
00:26:12,913 --> 00:26:15,213
Hide your dumbbells and protect your ego!

458
00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:17,913
Because this grim reaper doesn't just reap souls,

459
00:26:17,913 --> 00:26:19,413
she rips the gym apart!

460
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:21,813
Her favorite line is:

461
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,113
"Only time can out-bench me."

462
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:27,613
Please welcome... Mori Calliope!

463
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:34,413
Mori Calliope!

464
00:26:48,413 --> 00:26:49,913
Happy birthday Zeta!

465
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:54,413
MORI CALLIOPE

466
00:26:51,413 --> 00:26:52,413
Yeah boi!

467
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,213
Good! Everyone has gathered, right?

468
00:27:06,413 --> 00:27:08,413
This is probably a big surprise, huh?

469
00:27:08,413 --> 00:27:10,913
And I'm sure you're all wondering what kind of test this is gonna be!

470
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:12,913
Anyone have any guesses?

471
00:27:13,413 --> 00:27:14,913
Don't say ground pounding.

472
00:27:15,913 --> 00:27:17,413
She just said that!

473
00:27:18,413 --> 00:27:19,913
Oh, correct!

474
00:27:19,913 --> 00:27:22,213
We're holding a physical test using this long stick...

475
00:27:22,213 --> 00:27:24,913
...with these Bazo weights to determine if you are fit enough...

476
00:27:24,913 --> 00:27:27,413
...to pass off as a secret agent!

477
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:28,913
RIP Bozo.

478
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:33,913
Okay, okay.

479
00:27:33,913 --> 00:27:35,613
For level 1 of the physical test!

480
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:40,613
First, lift Bazo from the ring mat up to your hips...

481
00:27:40,613 --> 00:27:43,213
...as many times as you can within 30 seconds.

482
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,413
For level 2,

483
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,613
the mat will be bumpy.

484
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:48,913
You'll do the same thing as many times as you can...

485
00:27:48,913 --> 00:27:50,413
...within 30 seconds.

486
00:27:50,913 --> 00:27:52,213
And for the last level,

487
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:55,413
you'll stand on the bumpy mat and balance a cup on your head!

488
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:58,913
Make sure you don't drop it, and lift Bazo up!

489
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:00,913
Well then, are you guys ready?

490
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:02,913
Let's go!

491
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:10,913
Okay, who's ready for the physical test?

492
00:28:16,413 --> 00:28:18,413
Maybe we should have... Bijou start first?

493
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:22,913
I got it!

494
00:28:27,913 --> 00:28:28,913
Okay, are you ready?

495
00:28:29,413 --> 00:28:30,413

Now IRyS!

513
00:29:11,913 --> 00:29:12,913
IRyS!

514
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:14,413
I got this.

515
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:17,413
Yes, full potential!

516
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:20,913
Start!

517
00:29:20,913 --> 00:29:22,913

It's a tie!

531
00:30:06,328 --> 00:30:07,028

大丈夫、大丈夫。
It's okay, it's okay.

00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,328
Anyway, that was weak.

Twenty-nine!

565
00:30:44,628 --> 00:30:45,928
Like I said...

566
00:30:46,128 --> 00:30:48,128
You have to show us what you're made of.

567
00:30:48,628 --> 00:30:49,328
Okay...

568
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:50,628

You did great!

608
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:41,628
That was crazy.

609
00:31:41,928 --> 00:31:43,628
She is a secret agent after all.

610
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:51,628
Okay, now who's ready for Level 2?

611
00:31:55,128 --> 00:31:57,128
I don't know about this one...

612
00:31:58,128 --> 00:31:59,928
Wait a minute, that's not fair!

613
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,128
Those are Biboo's brothers and sisters!

614
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:09,128
That's not fair!

615
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:10,628
She has an advantage!

616
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:12,128
Pebbles! You see this?

617
00:32:12,628 --> 00:32:13,928
They're loving it!

618
00:32:15,128 --> 00:32:16,628
Oh, it hurts though...

Thirty-four!

653
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:55,928
Was that her full power?

654
00:32:57,628 --> 00:32:58,928
That's Level 2!

655
00:32:59,328 --> 00:33:00,628
Give me strength!

656
00:33:04,128 --> 00:33:05,628
No, don't step on them!

657
00:33:07,628 --> 00:33:09,128
Show them who you are!

658
00:33:10,628 --> 00:33:12,128
Take your time...

659
00:33:12,628 --> 00:33:14,128
How does it feel?

660
00:33:18,128 --> 00:33:18,928

680
00:33:38,128 --> 00:33:38,928
Nineteen!

681
00:33:39,128 --> 00:33:39,928
Twenty!

682
00:33:40,128 --> 00:33:40,928
Twenty-one!

683
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:50,128
Time's up!

684
00:33:56,628 --> 00:33:58,128
She's lost for words.

685
00:34:01,128 --> 00:34:02,128
Are you okay?

686
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,128
It's not like the pebbles are gonna help me.

687
00:34:09,628 --> 00:34:11,128
So...

688
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,928
I'll try to just do my best.

689
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:13,928
You got this!

690
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:16,328
Start!

691
00:34:16,628 --> 00:34:17,328
One!

692
00:34:17,628 --> 00:34:18,328
Two!

693
00:34:18,628 --> 00:34:19,328
Three!

694
00:34:19,628 --> 00:34:20,328
Four!

695
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:21,328
Five!

696
00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:22,328
Six!

697
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:23,328
Seven!

698
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:24,328
Eight!

699
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:25,328
Nine!

700
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:26,328
Ten!

701
00:34:26,628 --> 00:34:27,328
Eleven!

702
00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:28,328
Twelve!

703
00:34:28,628 --> 00:34:29,328
Thirteen!

704
00:34:29,628 --> 00:34:30,328
Fourteen!

705
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:31,328
Fifteen!

706
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:32,328
Sixteen!

707
00:34:32,628 --> 00:34:33,328
Seventeen!

708
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:34,328
Eighteen!

709
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:35,328
Nineteen!

710
00:34:35,628 --> 00:34:36,328
Twenty!

711
00:34:36,628 --> 00:34:37,328
Twenty-one!

712
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:38,328
Twenty-two!

713
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:39,328
Twenty-three!

714
00:34:39,628 --> 00:34:40,328
Twenty-four!

715
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:41,328
Twenty-five!

716
00:34:41,628 --> 00:34:42,328
Twenty-six!

717
00:34:42,628 --> 00:34:43,328
Twenty-seven!

718
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:44,328
Twenty-eight!

719
00:34:44,628 --> 00:34:45,328
Twenty-nine!

720
00:34:45,628 --> 00:34:46,328
Thirty!

721
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:47,628
Time's up!

722
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,628
Thirty-three!

723
00:34:58,128 --> 00:35:00,128
Your form was perfect.

724
00:35:08,043 --> 00:35:09,443
32!

725
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:10,343
Yeah!

726
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:11,743
I'll take it.

727
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,743
Step on those pebbles, like they were...

728
00:35:14,743 --> 00:35:16,843
Biboo gives you permission.

729
00:35:16,843 --> 00:35:18,443
Yeah, Biboo gives me permission.

730
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:19,943
Whaaa!

731
00:35:21,043 --> 00:35:22,943
She's going Super Saiyan.

732
00:35:23,443 --> 00:35:24,143
Yeah!

733
00:35:24,143 --> 00:35:25,943
Something's coming out of me!

734
00:35:26,743 --> 00:35:28,743
All right, is that all? Are you ready?

735
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:29,443
Yeah!

736
00:35:29,743 --> 00:35:32,743
3, 2, 1, Go!

737
00:35:32,943 --> 00:35:33,743
Start!

738
00:35:32,943 --> 00:35:34,843
One! Two!

739
00:35:34,943 --> 00:35:39,443
Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven!

740
00:35:39,443 --> 00:35:42,443
Eight! Nine! Ten! Eleven!

741
00:35:42,443 --> 00:35:43,943
Mama! Mama!

742
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:45,943
13! 14! 15!

743
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:48,943
16! 17! 18! 19! 20!

744
00:35:48,943 --> 00:35:51,943
21! 22! 23! 24!

745
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:55,943
25! 26! 27! 28! 29!

746
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:57,943
30! 31! 32!

747
00:35:57,943 --> 00:35:59,443
Oh my god! 33!

748
00:35:59,443 --> 00:36:01,943
34! 35! 36! 37!

749
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:03,943
Time's up!

750
00:36:04,043 --> 00:36:05,943
Yaaay!

751
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:09,443
My butt...

752
00:36:09,443 --> 00:36:11,443
Ow! It hurts so bad.

753
00:36:11,443 --> 00:36:12,943
It is over!

754
00:36:13,443 --> 00:36:15,443
I'm glad you guys are having fun!

755
00:36:15,443 --> 00:36:18,443
Level 3 of the physical test is gonna be pretty tough, though.

756
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,443
You guys ready?

757
00:36:20,943 --> 00:36:23,943
For Level 3, I've got a little something...

758
00:36:23,943 --> 00:36:26,443
behind me, which is a...

759
00:36:26,443 --> 00:36:27,443
A cup!

760
00:36:27,443 --> 00:36:28,443
A cup!

761
00:36:28,443 --> 00:36:29,743
Would you like a cup of tea?

762
00:36:29,943 --> 00:36:30,943
Um, maybe later.

763
00:36:30,943 --> 00:36:32,443
It's tea time!

764
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:36,943
Uh, while you guys are stepping... uh, while we are stepping on the...

765
00:36:36,943 --> 00:36:38,443
...bumpy mat...

766
00:36:38,443 --> 00:36:40,943
We're also gonna be balancing this cup on top of our head like this.

767
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:42,443
Oh, it's so over.

768
00:36:43,943 --> 00:36:45,443
You'll have to use the mat?

769
00:36:45,743 --> 00:36:46,743
Yeah, we still have...

770
00:36:46,943 --> 00:36:48,443
It's a combination of everything!

771
00:36:48,943 --> 00:36:49,943
Yeah.

772
00:36:49,943 --> 00:36:51,943
And while lifting as well, of course.

773
00:36:53,943 --> 00:36:55,443
Yeah, it doesn't affect us at all.

774
00:36:55,443 --> 00:36:56,943
At all! It doesn't affect us at all!

775
00:36:57,943 --> 00:36:59,443
Okay. Crown me.

776
00:36:59,443 --> 00:37:01,443
Crown... Crown the princess.

777
00:37:01,943 --> 00:37:02,943
Oh, oh...

778
00:37:03,443 --> 00:37:04,943
There you go. It's so over.

779
00:37:05,443 --> 00:37:06,443
It's so over.

780
00:37:06,943 --> 00:37:08,943
Pray to the people. Are you ready?

781
00:37:08,943 --> 00:37:11,443
It's not over! Hold on!

782
00:37:11,443 --> 00:37:13,943
Remember to use your butt and your legs.

783
00:37:13,943 --> 00:37:16,443
Okay, butt and my legs. Okay form.

784
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:17,443
Okay. Ready?

785
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,943
Are you ready? Yeah!

786
00:37:18,943 --> 00:37:20,443
Okay. Start!

787
00:37:21,943 --> 00:37:25,443
One! Two! Three!

788
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,443
Four! Five! Six! Seven!

789
00:37:28,443 --> 00:37:30,443
Eight! Nine!

790
00:37:30,443 --> 00:37:31,443
Oh no!

791
00:37:32,943 --> 00:37:36,443
Ten! Eleven! Twelve! 13!

792
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:39,443
14! 15! 16! 17!

793
00:37:39,443 --> 00:37:42,943
18! 19! 20! 21!

794
00:37:42,943 --> 00:37:45,943
22! 23! 24! 25!

795
00:37:45,943 --> 00:37:49,443
26! 27! 28! 29!

796
00:37:49,443 --> 00:37:51,943
30! 31! 32!

797
00:37:51,943 --> 00:37:52,943
Time's up!

798
00:37:52,943 --> 00:37:54,943
Yaaaay!

799
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:58,443
I like how the cup was like, stuck on her head.

800
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,943
Yeah, that was funny.

801
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:01,943
It turned over and it was hot on her head.

802
00:38:01,943 --> 00:38:02,943
28!

803
00:38:03,943 --> 00:38:05,443
IRyS. Hybrid.

804
00:38:05,943 --> 00:38:07,443
Princess.

805
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:08,943
I have...

806
00:38:08,943 --> 00:38:10,443
Beautiful posture.

807
00:38:10,443 --> 00:38:11,443
Exactly.

808
00:38:11,443 --> 00:38:13,443
You have the posture.

809
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:16,943
This is my strong point.

810
00:38:16,943 --> 00:38:18,943
Because I'm really good at keeping it on my head.

811
00:38:20,443 --> 00:38:22,943
Wait a sec. Don't put it on me yet.

812
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:25,943
Okay, you may place it on my head. The crown.

813
00:38:25,943 --> 00:38:27,943
Milady. Here goes the cup.

814
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:29,943
Thank you. Oh, it's beautiful.

815
00:38:29,943 --> 00:38:31,943
My coronation.

816
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,943
3, 2, 1, Start!

817
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:39,943
One! Two! Three!

818
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:43,443
Four! Five! Six! Seven!

819
00:38:43,443 --> 00:38:45,943
Eight! Nine! Ten!

820
00:38:45,943 --> 00:38:48,943
Eleven! Twelve!

821
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:51,943
Noooo! Noooo!

822
00:38:54,443 --> 00:38:55,943
Go for it!

823
00:38:56,943 --> 00:38:59,443
Nine! Ten! Eleven!

824
00:38:59,943 --> 00:39:02,943
Twelve! Oh my god! No no no!

825
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:06,943
Time's up!

826
00:39:10,943 --> 00:39:12,443
I'm proud of you.

827
00:39:14,943 --> 00:39:16,443
This stupid cup!

828
00:39:16,443 --> 00:39:17,743
Stupid, stupid cup!

829
00:39:17,743 --> 00:39:19,443
Don't blame the cup!

830
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,943
Maybe my good form will come in handy here.

831
00:39:23,943 --> 00:39:24,943
Yeah, exactly.

832
00:39:24,943 --> 00:39:27,443
You may place the tiara on my head.

833
00:39:27,443 --> 00:39:29,443
No, you have to step on it first.

834
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:30,443
Oh, come on.

835
00:39:30,943 --> 00:39:32,943
It's the pain before the gain.

836
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:34,943
Pain before the game?

837
00:39:34,943 --> 00:39:36,443
Pain is beauty.

838
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:40,443
I shall place it on top of your crown...

839
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:41,943
...so you have double crown.

840
00:39:41,943 --> 00:39:42,943
Awesome.

841
00:39:43,943 --> 00:39:44,943
Okay.

842
00:39:45,443 --> 00:39:46,943
Are you ready, coach?

843
00:39:47,943 --> 00:39:48,943
Maybe.

844
00:39:49,943 --> 00:39:51,943
3, 2, 1, Start!

845
00:39:52,943 --> 00:39:55,943
One! Two! Three!

846
00:39:55,943 --> 00:39:59,443
Four! Five! Six! Seven!

847
00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:04,798
Eighteen!

848
00:40:04,798 --> 00:40:05,748
Nineteen!

849
00:40:05,748 --> 00:40:06,698
Twenty!

850
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:08,048
Twenty-one!

851
00:40:08,048 --> 00:40:09,348
Twenty-two!

852
00:40:09,348 --> 00:40:10,748
Twenty-three!

853
00:40:10,748 --> 00:40:12,048
Twenty-four!

854
00:40:12,048 --> 00:40:13,298
Twenty-five!

855
00:40:13,298 --> 00:40:14,798
Twenty-six!

856
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:18,998
Oh, my posture!

857
00:40:23,098 --> 00:40:24,298
Time's up!

858
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:28,298
That was my goal!

859
00:40:28,298 --> 00:40:29,798
Got the 24!

860
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:33,998
And I didn't lose the cup even once!

861
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:37,098
You sure this cup is not rigged?

862
00:40:38,398 --> 00:40:40,098
Super glue?

863
00:40:40,098 --> 00:40:40,998
Was it super glue?

864
00:40:45,898 --> 00:40:48,898
Let's really test it, get in there...

865
00:40:52,098 --> 00:40:53,398
Zeta's turn!

866
00:40:57,698 --> 00:41:00,398
Directly right in the center of your head.

867
00:41:02,698 --> 00:41:04,498
This is like the best birthday ever.

868
00:41:05,698 --> 00:41:06,698
Yay, I'm glad!

869
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,098
Now then, are you ready?

870
00:41:09,098 --> 00:41:12,398

00:41:12,898 --> 00:41:13,798

878
00:41:19,498 --> 00:41:20,698
Eight!

879
00:41:20,698 --> 00:41:21,798

880
00:41:21,798 --> 00:41:22,898

883
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:26,098
Thirteen!

884
00:41:26,098 --> 00:41:27,098
Fourteen!

885
00:41:27,098 --> 00:41:28,098
Fifteen!

886
00:41:28,098 --> 00:41:28,998
Sixteen!

887
00:41:28,998 --> 00:41:29,998
Seventeen!

888
00:41:29,998 --> 00:41:30,898
Eighteen!

889
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:31,798

891
00:41:32,598 --> 00:41:33,498
Twenty-one!

892
00:41:37,098 --> 00:41:37,998
Twenty-two!

893
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:38,798
Twenty-three!

894
00:41:38,798 --> 00:41:39,698
Twenty-four!

895
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:40,598
Twenty-five!

896
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:41,898
Twenty-six!

897
00:41:42,398 --> 00:41:43,498
Time's up!

898
00:41:43,598 --> 00:41:44,798
Yay!

899
00:41:47,098 --> 00:41:48,398
Twenty-six!

900
00:41:48,398 --> 00:41:49,098
You did it!

901
00:41:49,598 --> 00:41:51,398
Twenty-six is the final number!

902
00:41:55,198 --> 00:41:57,098
Does that mean the scores are what I think it is?

903
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:58,198
I think so!

904
00:41:58,498 --> 00:41:59,998
Is anyone keeping score?

905
00:42:01,198 --> 00:42:03,098
Staff-san has been keeping score for us!

906
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:05,098
You are a winner!

907
00:42:05,098 --> 00:42:06,098
I am a winner?

908
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:13,598
What matters is what's inside.

909
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,398
Seems like you guys completed the test! Woohoo!

910
00:42:17,398 --> 00:42:19,398
Some of you were able to lift pretty well.

911
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:21,498
Maybe not for some, though.

912
00:42:23,098 --> 00:42:24,998
It was so much fun just watching!

913
00:42:24,998 --> 00:42:26,098
But come on, Zeta!

914
00:42:26,198 --> 00:42:27,298
You're the birthday girl!

915
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:30,398
You should be showing us your crazy skills or something!

916
00:42:31,498 --> 00:42:32,998
Prove it to us next test, okay?

917
00:42:33,398 --> 00:42:35,098
Well then, thank you for having me!

918
00:42:35,298 --> 00:42:37,298
This is Amelia Watson signing off.

919
00:42:37,898 --> 00:42:38,798
Until next time!

920
00:42:38,798 --> 00:42:39,698
Bye!

921
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,598
Thank you so much!

922
00:42:51,398 --> 00:42:52,398
Good luck!

923
00:43:05,198 --> 00:43:06,098
See ya!

924
00:43:16,098 --> 00:43:17,398
あいつを狙おう！
Let's target her!

925
00:43:23,098 --> 00:43:25,098
やめてくれ！やめてくれ！
Stop it! Stop it!

926
00:43:41,098 --> 00:43:42,698
楽しそう！楽しそう！
Looks fun! Looks fun!

927
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:46,598
ゼータ？
Zeta?

928
00:43:46,798 --> 00:43:48,598
何水鉄砲持ってるの？
Why are you holding a water gun?

929
00:43:49,098 --> 00:43:50,398
やめて！やめて！
Stop! Stop!

930
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:01,198
撃てるよ！
I can shoot!

931
00:44:04,098 --> 00:44:05,298
どういうこと？
What does this mean?

932
00:44:05,398 --> 00:44:06,698
誰か説明して〜！
Someone explain~!

933
00:44:08,098 --> 00:44:10,098
Bokobokobo~ Kobo Kanaeru at your service!

934
00:44:11,098 --> 00:44:13,398
Let me be your sun to shine your day! Ehehe!

935
00:44:14,098 --> 00:44:15,198
ゼータ、誕生日おめでとう！
Zeta, happy birthday!

936
00:44:18,598 --> 00:44:21,098
I already told them what to do before you came here,

937
00:44:21,098 --> 00:44:22,898
so they know the rules!

938
00:44:23,598 --> 00:44:27,098
この水鉄砲で君のエイム力を確かめるよ！
We're gonna be testing your aim skills with this water gun!

939
00:44:28,598 --> 00:44:32,498
In shooting level 1, we will see how many immobile targets you can hit within 30 seconds.

940
00:44:32,998 --> 00:44:37,098
In level 2, we will see how many moving targets you can hit within 30 seconds.

941
00:44:37,398 --> 00:44:42,098
And level 3 will test if you can hit the targets on the moving zombie.

942
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:46,398
誰が最強のエイム力を持っているかな？
Who do you think is the best shooter here?

943
00:44:47,398 --> 00:44:48,898
オレア！オレア！
Orea! Orea!

944
00:44:50,698 --> 00:44:53,498
トワ達みんななんとFPSやってるんでね！
We all play FPS games, you know!

945
00:44:54,198 --> 00:44:54,998
そうだね！
That's right!

946
00:44:55,898 --> 00:44:57,398
私はやってないけどね。
I don't play them though.

947
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:01,598
どういうこと？誰か説明して〜
What do you mean? Someone explain~

948
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:08,239
私も負けないよー！
I won't lose either!

949
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:10,639
Level 1

950
00:45:11,139 --> 00:45:12,339
こちらに！
Over here!

951
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:14,239
動かない的があるので...
There are stationary targets...

952
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:17,339
こちらをみんなで一人ずつ撃っていこうかなと思います。
...so let's all shoot them one by one.

953
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,039
頑張るー！
I'll do my best!

954
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:18,939
順番どうしましょう？
How should we decide the order?

955
00:45:18,939 --> 00:45:19,639
一番！
First!

956
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:20,539
やりたい！やりたい！
I wanna do it! I wanna do it!

957
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:21,639
やりたい！やりたい！
Me too! Me too!

958
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:22,939
やったー！
Yay!

959
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:26,039
まつりちゃんは見やすい位置...
I'll go to a spot where it's easy to see...

960
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:27,139
しょうがないね。
Can't be helped.

961
00:45:27,139 --> 00:45:30,039
撃たない三人はね、ここら辺で見て待ってましょう。
The three not shooting can watch from here.

962
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:30,639
はーい。
Okay.

963
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:31,439
3...

964
00:45:31,439 --> 00:45:32,039
2...

965
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:32,639
1...

966
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:33,439
スタート！
Start!

967
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,339
はい！
Yes!

968
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:36,539
おお、うま！
Oh, so good!

969
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:37,239
ごめん！
Sorry!

970
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:37,939
ごめん！
Sorry!

971
00:45:37,939 --> 00:45:38,539
ごめん！
Sorry!

972
00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:39,339
え？
Eh?

973
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:40,239
マシーンなの？
Is she a machine?

974
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:42,139
まさかパーフェクトおじさんじゃない？
Isn't that 'Mr. Perfect'?

975
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,139
ごめん！ごめん！
Sorry! Sorry!

976
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:44,139
パーフェクトおじさんじゃない？
Isn't she 'Mr. Perfect'?

977
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:45,939
ごめん！
Sorry!

978
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:47,039
え、うますぎる！
Whoa, too good!

979
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:47,739
ヤバい！
Dangerous!

980
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:48,539
すごすぎる！
Too amazing!

981
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:50,639
残り15秒！
15 seconds left!

982
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:51,139
え？！
Eh?!

983
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:53,639
これみんなには分かんないけど、ぶっちゃけ難しいからねこれ。
You guys might not realize, but this is honestly super hard.

984
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:54,139
すごいすごいすごい！
Amazing, amazing!

985
00:45:54,139 --> 00:45:55,939
偏差とかもなしに...
Without even needing to lead the shots...

986
00:45:55,939 --> 00:45:57,139
え、これ最後？
Eh, is this the last one?

987
00:45:57,139 --> 00:45:57,939
最後？！
Last one?!

988
00:45:58,239 --> 00:45:59,339
えー？！
Ehh?!

989
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,139
あと一個！あと一個！
One more! One more!

990
00:46:00,939 --> 00:46:01,739
はい！
Hup!

991
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:04,139
おおー！！
Oooooh!!

992
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:05,039
終わっちゃったー！
Finished!

993
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:05,639
怖っ！
Scary!

994
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:06,539
無限に...
Infinitely...

995
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:07,439
まつりちゃんは...
Matsuri-chan...

996
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:11,139
一発も外さず全て取れましたー！
...got them all without missing a single shot!

997
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:12,939
やったー！すごーい！
Yay! Amazing!

998
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:15,339
え、すごすぎる...
Eh, that's too good...

999
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,239
うますぎるよね。
Way too good, right?

1000
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:17,339
なんかちょっと行きづらいわ。
Kinda hard to follow that.

1001
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:18,139
ハードル下げていこう。
Let's lower the hurdle.

1002
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:19,139
あ、マジ？
Ah, really?

1003
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:20,139
じゃあトワ様でしょ、次は。
Then it's Towa-sama next, right?

1004
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:22,339
あ、トワ様だ！
Ah, Towa-sama it is!

1005
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:23,639
じゃあトワ...
Okay then, Towa...

頑張れ！
Do your best!

1007
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:26,139
いけるいける！
You can do it!

1008
00:46:26,139 --> 00:46:27,639
支えるよ、支える感じでいくよ。
I'll support you, I'll go with a supporting vibe.

1009
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:28,639
じゃあカウントお願いします。
Start the count, please.

1010
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:29,639
大事、大事。
Important, important.

1011
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:32,739
3...

1012
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:33,339
2...

1013
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:34,039
1...

1014
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:34,939

00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,139
おい！
Oi!

1020
00:46:41,139 --> 00:46:41,639
速い速い！
Fast, fast!

1021
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:43,139
はい！
Yes!

1022
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:43,639
あー！

順調順調！
Smooth sailing!

1025
00:46:46,939 --> 00:46:47,639
はい、ここ！
Okay, here!

1026
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:48,739
うまい！
Good!

1027
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:49,439
え、ちょっと待って！
Eh, wait a sec!

1028
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:50,739
はい！
Yup!

1029
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:51,639
うまい、うまい！
Good, good!

1030
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:52,439
めっちゃ速い！
So fast!

1031
00:46:52,439 --> 00:46:53,139
ここ！
Here!

1032
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:54,139
はい！
Hup!

1033
00:46:54,139 --> 00:46:54,639
え、うま！
Eh, good!

1034
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:55,539
ここ！
Here!

1035
00:46:56,139 --> 00:46:56,739
よし！
Alright!

1036
00:46:57,139 --> 00:46:58,139
いい感じ！
Nice feeling!

1037
00:46:58,139 --> 00:46:59,639
やったー！
I did it!

1038
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:00,639
すごーい！
Amazing!

1039
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:02,439
だんだん超えてくんだ、これ。
It's gradually getting harder to beat.

1040
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:03,939
次どうする？
Who's next?

1041
00:47:03,939 --> 00:47:04,639
いやー...
No way...

1042
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:06,439
先にやった方がいい！
Better to go first!

1043
00:47:06,439 --> 00:47:07,239
じゃあ、じゃあ、じゃあ...
Okay, okay, okay...

1044
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:08,639
トリはね...
The grand finale is...

1045
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:10,639
とりあえずね。
For now.

1046
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:12,639
作戦あるんだ。
I have a strategy.

1047
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,639
下半身作戦！
Lower Body Strategy!

1048
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:14,439
下半身作戦？
Lower Body Strategy?

1049
00:47:14,439 --> 00:47:16,639
下半身を安定させブレないようにする。
Stabilize the lower body to prevent shaking.

1050
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:18,139
安定、安定。
Stable, stable.

1051
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:19,139
ポーズだっせぇ！
That pose is so lame!

1052
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:21,139
ダサすぎる！
Too lame!

1053
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:22,139
これでいくから。
I'm going with this.

1054
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:23,139
3...

1055
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:23,639
2...

1056
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:24,139
1...

1057
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:25,139
どうぞ！
Go ahead!

1058
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:25,639
オラ！
Ora!

1059
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:27,639
頑張れー！
Do your best!

1060
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:28,639
頑張れ！
Fight!

1061
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:29,639
頑張れー！
Go for it!

1062
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:34,139
安定させて...
Stabilize...

1063
00:47:35,139 --> 00:47:35,939
当たってる、当たってる！
Hit, hit!

1064
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:40,139
適当に撃つ...
Just shooting randomly...

1065
00:47:43,139 --> 00:47:44,139
あ、でも惜しい惜しい。
Ah, but close, close.

1066
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:46,139
ヤバい！
Oh no!

1067
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:47,639
空に...
Into the sky...

1068
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:49,139
もっと上！
Higher!

1069
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:50,139
もっと上！
Higher!

1070
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:52,639
頑張って、頑張って！
Come on, come on!

1071
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:53,639
いいよ、それ空だぞ！
Nice, but that's the sky!

1072
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:59,639
ラプラスの結果は、まあ...
La+'s result is, well...

1073
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:01,139
ボイドということで。
...void.

1074
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:02,139
イェーイ！
Yay!

1075
00:48:05,139 --> 00:48:06,139
最後、行きますか！
Shall we go for the last one?

1076
00:48:06,139 --> 00:48:07,139
行きます！
I'm going!

1077
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:08,639
頑張れ！
Good luck!

1078
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:11,139
ということで、じゃあ最後ゼータ。
Alright, so lastly, Zeta.

1079
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,639
一秒で？
In one second?

1080
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:14,639
いやいやいや。
No no no.

1081
00:48:16,139 --> 00:48:16,939
準備オッケー？
Ready OK?

1082
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:17,739
準備オッケー。
Ready OK.

1083
00:48:18,139 --> 00:48:18,639
いくよ！
Here we go!

1084
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:19,139
3...

1085
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:19,639
2...

1086
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:20,139
1...

1087
00:48:20,139 --> 00:48:21,139
ゴー！
Go!

1088
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:24,639
お、いいよ！
Oh, nice!

1089
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:27,139
いいよ！
Nice!

1090
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:28,139
すごいすごい！
Amazing!

1091
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:29,639
思ったよりうまい！
Better than I thought!

1092
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:31,139
うまいよ！
You're good!

1093
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:33,139
いや、これは...
No, this is...

1094
00:48:38,139 --> 00:48:39,139
全然余裕、余裕！
Totally easy, easy!

1095
00:48:42,139 --> 00:48:43,139
まだ、まだ！
Still, still!

1096
00:48:44,139 --> 00:48:44,939
どこだ？
Where?

1097
00:48:44,939 --> 00:48:45,639
どこどこ？
Where, where?

1098
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:46,139
右右右！
Right right right!

1099
00:48:46,139 --> 00:48:47,139
そっちそっち！
That way!

1100
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:49,139
下です、下です！
Below, below!

1101
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:50,139
どこにある？
Where is it?

1102
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:51,139
どこだ？
Where?

1103
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:53,139
あれ？
Huh?

1104
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,139
どこだ？
Where is it?

1105
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:56,139
なくなった？
Did it disappear?

1106
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:58,639
バグか、これは？
Is this a bug?

1107
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:01,139
神様が手伝ってもらったか？
Did God help us out?

1108
00:49:03,139 --> 00:49:04,139
どこだ？
Where was it?

1109
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:05,139
あれ？
Huh?

1110
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:08,139
なんかギリギリ滑り込みで...
Somehow slid in just in time...

1111
00:49:08,139 --> 00:49:09,139
判定だー！
It counted!

1112
00:49:09,139 --> 00:49:11,139
イェーイ！
Yay!

1113
00:49:12,139 --> 00:49:14,139
Level 2

1114
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:16,139
あちらをご覧ください！
Please look over there!

1115
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:16,639
はい！
Yes!

1116
00:49:16,939 --> 00:49:18,139
動いてる！
They're moving!

1117
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:19,639
無茶苦茶！
That's messy!

1118
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:21,139
はい、頑張っていきましょう。
Okay, let's do our best.

1119
00:49:23,139 --> 00:49:24,139
じゃあ誰から行く？
So, who's going first?

1120
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:25,639
おるぞ、おるぞ！
I'm here, I'm here!

1121
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:27,139
私も行きたい！
I want to go too!

1122
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:29,139
譲る譲る譲る！
I'll yield, I'll yield!

1123
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:31,139
もう言っちゃったから、じゃあラプラス。
Since you said it, La+ goes.

1124
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:32,639
もう言っちゃったからね。
Since I already said it.

1125
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:33,139
いいんだ。
That's fine.

1126
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,639
やったもん勝ちでヤバい。
First come first served is crazy.

1127
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:38,139
ではいきましょう、ラプラス。
Then let's go, La+.

1128
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:41,139
3...

1129
00:49:41,139 --> 00:49:42,139
2...

1130
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:42,639
1...

1131
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:43,639
スタート！
Start!

1132
00:49:44,139 --> 00:49:46,139
このゲームには必勝法がある！
There is a winning strategy for this game!

1133
00:49:46,139 --> 00:49:47,639
めっちゃ回っとるやん！
She's spinning like crazy!

1134
00:49:49,139 --> 00:49:51,139
目が回る！
I'm getting dizzy!

1135
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:53,139
当たらん！
Not hitting!

1136
00:49:53,139 --> 00:49:54,139
ずるい！
Unfair!

1137
00:49:54,139 --> 00:49:55,639
後ろから撃ってるのヤバいって！
Shooting from behind is crazy!

1138
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:56,639
当たってないよ！
You're not hitting!

1139
00:49:57,139 --> 00:49:58,139
前見て！
Look forward!

1140
00:50:05,527 --> 00:50:06,927
裏だ！裏だ！
It's the back! It's the back!

1141
00:50:07,627 --> 00:50:09,227
あと5秒しかないよ！
Only 5 seconds left!

1142
00:50:09,427 --> 00:50:10,927
一個しか倒してないよ！
You only got one!

1143
00:50:11,227 --> 00:50:12,427
頑張れ！
Do your best!

1144
00:50:14,527 --> 00:50:15,927
Time's up!

1145
00:50:15,927 --> 00:50:18,227
一個... すごいよ一個。
One... one is amazing.

1146
00:50:18,927 --> 00:50:20,227
ゼータ行きたい？
Zeta, wanna go?

1147
00:50:20,227 --> 00:50:21,627
ゼータ行きたい！
Zeta wants to go!

1148
00:50:22,427 --> 00:50:23,927
はい！じゃあゼータ行きます！
Okay! Zeta is going!

1149
00:50:23,927 --> 00:50:25,427
行きます！
I'm going!

1150
00:50:27,227 --> 00:50:29,427
ラプラスみたいに後ろ向かなくていい？
You don't need to turn your back like Laplus?

1151
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:30,927
あ、大丈夫。
Ah, I'm fine.

1152
00:50:32,927 --> 00:50:34,627
メンタル調整行きましょう！
Let's go for a mental reset!

1153
00:50:37,927 --> 00:50:39,427
Start!

1154
00:50:39,627 --> 00:50:41,427
頑張れ！
Go go!

1155
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,427
あー、裏面だったな。
Ah, it was the back side.

1156
00:51:02,427 --> 00:51:04,427
これもう後ろだから！
This is already the back!

1157
00:51:09,427 --> 00:51:10,927
Time's up!

1158
00:51:13,427 --> 00:51:16,427
残念、ゼータ達裏面です。
Too bad, Zeta and co. got the back side.

1159
00:51:17,427 --> 00:51:18,927
めちゃくちゃ難しい...
It's so difficult...

1160
00:51:18,927 --> 00:51:20,427
これムズいよ！
This is hard!

1161
00:51:25,427 --> 00:51:27,927
最後やだから祭行かせてください。
Since it's the last one, let Matsuri go.

1162
00:51:29,427 --> 00:51:30,927
もう行っちゃった。
She's already going.

1163
00:51:32,927 --> 00:51:34,627
祭り先輩、行くぞ！
Matsuri-senpai, let's go!

1164
00:51:37,927 --> 00:51:39,227
Start!

1165
00:51:41,927 --> 00:51:43,227
お、上手い！
Oh, nice!

1166
00:51:57,427 --> 00:51:59,427
ムズいんだからこれ！
Because this is actually hard!

1167
00:52:08,427 --> 00:52:09,927
Time's up!

1168
00:52:13,927 --> 00:52:15,427
二個か...
Two, huh...

1169
00:52:24,927 --> 00:52:26,927
一点集中！
Focus on one point!

1170
00:52:30,427 --> 00:52:32,427
アドバイスを生かし、やろうかな。
I guess I'll use that advice.

1171
00:52:33,427 --> 00:52:35,227
トワちんの挑戦！
Towachin's challenge!

1172
00:52:36,927 --> 00:52:38,227
Start!

1173
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:45,227
ヤバい、こっち向け！
Crap, face this way!

1174
00:52:49,427 --> 00:52:50,927
あ、裏だ！
Ah, it's the back!

1175
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,927
タイミングだ、タイミングだ。
It's timing, it's timing.

1176
00:53:07,427 --> 00:53:08,927
Time's up!

1177
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:10,627
これ難しいんだよ！
This is really hard!

1178
00:53:11,927 --> 00:53:13,427
一枚でした！
It was one!

1179
00:53:21,927 --> 00:53:23,927
Level 3

1180
00:53:28,427 --> 00:53:29,927
ゾンビ！
Zombie!

1181
00:53:30,927 --> 00:53:32,427
気持ち悪い！
Gross!

1182
00:53:35,927 --> 00:53:37,927
動く的になってます！
It's a moving target!

1183
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:52,927
トワちんから、じゃあ行きましょう。
Starting with Towachin, let's go.

1184
00:53:53,927 --> 00:53:55,427
Start!

1185
00:53:55,927 --> 00:53:57,227
速っ！
So fast!

1186
00:54:03,427 --> 00:54:04,927
おい、こっち向け！
Hey, face this way!

1187
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:16,227
回るんだ！
It spins!

1188
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:24,927
よっしゃー！
Alright!

1189
00:54:26,427 --> 00:54:27,927
ギリギリです！
That was close!

1190
00:54:30,927 --> 00:54:32,927
二つ、なんと割れました！
Somehow, two were broken!

1191
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:44,427
じゃあ姉さんね。
Okay, big sister's turn.

1192
00:54:44,927 --> 00:54:46,227
頑張るぞ！
I'll do my best!

1193
00:54:49,927 --> 00:54:51,227
Start!

1194
00:54:51,427 --> 00:54:52,427
速っ！
Fast!

1195
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,227
速っ！
So fast!

1196
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,927
3秒で終わりました。
Finished in 3 seconds.

1197
00:55:07,268 --> 00:55:08,668
まずいよこれ
This is bad.

1198
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:10,668
やっちゃったやっちゃった
She totally did it.

1199
00:55:10,968 --> 00:55:14,968
今まつりちゃんが３秒で撃ち抜いちゃったということは
Since Matsuri-chan just shot it down in 3 seconds...

1200
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:19,668
多分もう次ゾンビは「あ、この動きしちゃいけないな」って風になって
The next zombie will probably learn not to move like that.

1201
00:55:19,968 --> 00:55:21,568
やばい学習するタイプだ
Oh no, it's the learning type!

1202
00:55:21,768 --> 00:55:23,168
学習ゾンビなんだ
It's a learning zombie.

1203
00:55:23,368 --> 00:55:25,168
ちょっと待ってじゃあ先にやる！
Wait, then I'll go first!

1204
00:55:26,268 --> 00:55:27,368
先にやる！
I'll do it first!

1205
00:55:28,468 --> 00:55:30,068
主役が最後だよな
The main character goes last, right?

1206
00:55:32,668 --> 00:55:34,068
Start!

1207
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,368
当たるんかい！
