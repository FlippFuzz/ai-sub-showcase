00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:33,545
Bazzo, can you think of where the key is?

91
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,345
Okay, Bazzo doesn't think.

00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:37,845
Bazzo nggak bisa mikir, dia nggak tahu kuncinya di mana.
Bazzo can't think, he doesn't know where the key is.

00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:56,545
Why would a laser be here?

99
00:10:56,545 --> 00:11:00,045
Okay, you know what? I get it. It's like security and all that.

I'm the master of infiltration!

102
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:08,545
I'm literally the best secret agent in the world. I can do this.

103
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:10,045

Wah, malah kabur dong!
Wow, he's actually running away!

114
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:35,545
Tunggu bentar, kabur!
Wait a minute, he's running away!

115
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:37,545
Gimana? Terus gimana?
How? Then what?

116
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:40,045
Terus gimana kalau dia kabur?
Then what if he runs away?

117
00:11:40,045 --> 00:11:42,545
Terus gimana kalau misalnya dia kabur?
Then what if, for example, he runs away?

118
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:45,045
Bazzo, kamu nggak mau duluan?
Bazzo, don't you want to go first?

Chase after him! You can do it!

122
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:54,045
Hey, isn't that cheating? He's just like going straight.

123
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:56,545
That's cheating! Hey, yeah, that's cheating!

ズルいそれ！
That's cheating!

125
00:11:58,545 --> 00:12:02,545
That's cheating, he just went straight. Now what?

126
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:06,045
Now what? Now I'm left alone.

127
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:10,045
Okay, it's okay. I can do this.

128
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:13,545
For the sake of my mission, I shall show to you...

129
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:17,545
...what a secret agent is truly like.

130
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:22,045
Okay... uhm... uhm... ah...

131
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:25,545
Merangkak dulu nggak sih?
Should I crawl first?

132
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,545
Maybe if I crawl under here...

133
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:32,045
...maybe... maybe it'll work if I crawl under.

134
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:36,045
Wah! Aduh, duh, duh, duh, duh...
Waah! Ouch, ouch, ouch...

135
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:38,045
Nggak sakit sih, tapi bohong nggak sakit.
It doesn't hurt, but just kidding, it does hurt.

136
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:40,045
It doesn't hurt, but... uhm...

137
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:44,045
Okay, that's because of my hair buns, my ears, or whatever you call it.

138
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:47,045
Okay, what about... what if I step over?

139
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:50,045
If I step over, maybe... Huaa!

140
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:53,045
Wah! Aduh, duh, duh, duh!
Wah! Ouch, ouch, ouch!

00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:29,045
Ah! Nggak bisa!
Ah! I can't!

152
00:13:29,545 --> 00:13:31,545
Wah! Ini bisa sih.
Wah! This might work.

153
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:33,545
Ini kayaknya bisa deh.
I think this might work.

154
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:37,045
If I do bridge like this, I can cross... ah, adeh.
If I do bridge like this, I can cross... ah, oh no.

155
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:41,045
Is it just me or did the laser just go up?

156
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:45,045
Somebody's operating it. Okay, well... okay, this is easy.

157
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:48,545
Limbo! We just have to do limbo, right?

158
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:52,545
Uh... Limbo! Ah! Aduh!
Uh... Limbo! Ah! Ouch!

159
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:55,545
Okay, okay, what do I do?

160
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:58,545
Aduuh! Wah, nggak bisa juga.
Ouch! Wow, that doesn't work either.

161
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:02,545
Okay, okay, nggak bisa, nggak bisa. Yo...
Okay, okay, it doesn't work, it doesn't work. Yo...

162
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:05,045
Ah...

163
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:08,545
You just have to crawl.

164
00:14:08,545 --> 00:14:11,045
Look at that, that was stupid. That was stupid.

165
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:14,045
Because I said that, then that never happened.

166
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:15,545
Adah...
Ouch...

167
00:14:15,545 --> 00:14:19,045
Okay, okay... ah... ah...

168
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:22,045
Just keep crawling I guess.

169
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:25,045
If I keep crawling, maybe I'll reach the destination faster.

170
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:28,045
Ah... what about this one?

171
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:31,045
What about... ah...

172
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:34,545
Aduh, ini tuh nggak bisa tembus tembok aja ya?
Ouch, can't I just phase through the wall?

173
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:37,045
Capek, serius.
I'm tired, seriously.

174
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:40,045
Aduh, kena! Kena! Rambutku kena!
Ouch, I got hit! I got hit! My hair got hit!

175
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,045
Okay... okay... watch me crawl again.

176
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:46,045
Watch this, watch this, watch this, chat, watch, watch.

177
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:56,045
Ah! Let's go! Ah... ah...

178
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:04,257
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Ah!

179
00:15:04,257 --> 00:15:05,857
Yeah. Sorry.

180
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:07,857
oshiri too big.
My butt is too big.

181
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:09,857
Okay, yay!

182
00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:13,557
Weehee! Yatta!
Weehee! We did it!

183
00:15:13,557 --> 00:15:15,057
That was so easy.

184
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:16,557
That was so easy. See?

185
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:19,057
I'm literally the best agent out there.

186
00:15:19,057 --> 00:15:20,857
Literally the best agent out there.

187
00:15:21,057 --> 00:15:23,557
Easy, gampang itu mah.
Easy, that's easy.

188
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:27,557
Gampang!
Easy!

189
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:29,257
Ini apaan?
What is this?

190
00:15:29,257 --> 00:15:30,857
Ini curang nggak sih?
Isn't this cheating?

191
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:33,257
Ini tuh kayak apa sih, kayak main game
It's like, you know, playing a game

192
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:35,857
terus level boss-nya tiba-tiba muncul di akhir.
and then the boss level suddenly appears at the end.

193
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:36,857
Kesel.
So annoying.

194
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:38,257
Okay, whatever.

195
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:40,857
There's like a new... what?

196
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:43,257
Ah! And it's moving.

197
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:44,557
This is so unfair.

198
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:46,057
これずるいな...
This is unfair...

199
00:15:46,557 --> 00:15:47,857
いけるかな?
Can I do it?

200
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:50,057
I don't know if I can make it.

201
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:52,057
Okay. Um...

202
00:15:52,057 --> 00:15:55,257
put your bets if I can... if you guys think I can make it.

203
00:15:55,557 --> 00:16:00,257
Three, two, wah tapi bohong.
Three, two, wah just kidding.

204
00:16:01,057 --> 00:16:08,557
Three, two, one! Woah!

205
00:16:09,557 --> 00:16:15,557
Yeah, yatta! Let's go! Let's go, we made it!
Yeah, we did it! Let's go! Let's go, we made it!

206
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,557
Bazo? Bazo-re? Bazo...

207
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:21,057
Bazo... Bazo-nya kabur duluan.
Bazo... Bazo ran away first.

208
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:23,257
Bazo nggak ada. Ya udahlah.
Bazo is gone. Oh well.

209
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:25,557
Ya udah, ayo sekarang kita kejar Sekretari.
Alright, let's go catch Secretary now.

Aneh banget sumpah. Eh?

00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:16,257
Don't, don't, don't destroy it.

251
00:18:16,257 --> 00:18:17,857
No, no, no, no, no.

252

うん。本当に帰ってくるかな?
Yeah. Will she really come back?

00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:07,557
大丈夫かな?
Will she be okay?

00:19:15,557 --> 00:19:18,057
あ! あ! Zeta ちゃん!
Ah! Ah! Zeta-chan!

You've ended up like that, are you okay?

00:19:22,557 --> 00:19:24,057
Zeta? Zeta?

00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:28,057
ポルカ先輩! 助けて!
Polka-senpai! Help me!

277
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:29,857
助けてじゃないよ。
It's not "help me".

278
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:31,557
Zeta を助けに行くんでしょう?
We're going to save Zeta, right?

279
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:35,557
Zeta も助け、 Bazo も助けないといけないのかポルカは。
Polka has to save Zeta and Bazo?

00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:36,557
助けて!

Okay, okay, okay. お願い。
Okay, okay, okay. Please.

Whoa, whoa, this is tough. Whoa, whoa...

290
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:56,557
高いの平気? ちなみに。
Are you okay with heights? By the way.

291
00:19:56,557 --> 00:19:57,557
高いの怖くない?
Aren't you afraid of heights?

292
00:19:57,557 --> 00:19:59,257
いや、怖くない。全然怖くない。
No, I'm not. I'm not afraid at all.

左、左。To the left.
Left, left. To the left.

297
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:09,019
無理です。動かせないです、こんなに。そんなに器用に動かないです。
It's impossible. I can't move like this. I can't move that skillfully.

298
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:12,019
どこがどこ辺そう？どこら辺そう？
Where, about where? About where is it?

299
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,019
見えた？

00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:20,019
これ鍵持ってないかな…？
Does this one not have the key...?

304
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:21,219
鍵どこ？
Where's the key?

305
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,069
There's no key!

306
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:27,319
それね、多分ハズレだ。
That's probably a miss.

307
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,019
ハズレ！？
A miss!?

308
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:32,519
それは多分普通のバゾだわ。
That's probably just a normal Bazo.

309
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:34,019
そうです。そうです。
That's right. That's right.

310
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:37,519
でも普通のバゾも可愛いからね。こっちね。
But the normal Bazo is cute too, right here.

311
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:41,569
あ、そんなに雑に投げられて…可哀想に。
Ah, being thrown so roughly... poor thing.

312
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:43,069
もう一回行こう。
Let's go again.

313
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:45,369
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

314
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,519
大丈夫？そろそろ、あのなんか底ってさ、どんな感じ？
Are you okay? By now, how does the bottom feel down there?

315
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:50,019
高い？怖い？
Is it high? Is it scary?

316
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:51,169
ううん、怖くない、怖くない。
No, it's not scary, not scary.

317
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,519
怖くないね！
Not scary!

318
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:54,019
じゃあ早めに行った方がいい。怖くない！
Then we should go quickly. Not scary!

319
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:56,619
じゃあもう一回さね。行くよ。
Then one more time. Here we go.

320
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:58,019
あ、ノー！はい！はい！
Ah, no! Yes! Yes!

321
00:20:58,219 --> 00:21:00,219
うわあ！どうする？どこだ？
Whoa! What should we do? Where is it?

322
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,919
ポルカ先輩、あと何秒？
Polka-senpai, how many seconds left?

323
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:05,219
三…どこら辺？あ、見えた、見えた？
Three... about where? Ah, did you see it? See it?

324
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,219
見えた！
I see it!

325
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,519
見えた、見えた、見えた！
I see it, see it, see it!

326
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:09,219
行くよ、はい、ストップ！
Going, hey, stop!

327
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,919
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

328
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,219
どこだ？これはさすがに行ったんじゃない？
Where? Didn't we get it this time?

329
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,019
ここじゃないかも…
It might not be here...

330
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:16,219
嘘でしょ！？
No way!?

331
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:18,519
ここじゃないかも。ね、ポルカ先輩、ここじゃないかも。
It might not be here. Hey, Polka-senpai, it might not be here.

332
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:21,519
いや、まだわかんない。見えない…うん。
No, we don't know yet. Can't see... yeah.

333
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:24,019
え！？あー！
Eh!? Aaa!

334
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:30,019
なんで！？
Why!?

335
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,519
まずい！？やばいって、それは！それよ！
Bad!? That's bad! That's it!

336
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:34,019
爆発？焦げた？
Explosion? Did it burn?

337
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,369
あれ？大丈夫？
Huh? Are you okay?

338
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:37,919
あれ？大丈夫じゃないかも。
Huh? Maybe I'm not okay.

339
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:40,019
線切れてない？大丈夫？
Is the line cut? Are you okay?

340
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:44,019
まあ、そういう時のためにね、ホロライブはね、いつもこうやって頑張ってますから。大丈夫ですよ。
Well, for times like this, Hololive is always working hard like this. It's okay.

341
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,019
ゼータさんはこうやって無事です。
Zeta-san is safe like this.

342
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,369
いや、私無事じゃないよ。
No, I'm not safe.

343
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:48,419
え！無事じゃないの！？
Eh! You're not safe!?

344
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,519
無事じゃないよ！
I'm not safe!

345
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:52,019
じゃあなんとかして早く！無事を確かめなくちゃ。
Then do something quickly! We have to confirm you're safe.

346
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:57,519
待って、でもよかった、黒焦げだけで済んで。よかった、よかった。じゃあ行くよ、ゼータ。
Wait, but I'm glad it only ended with you being charred black. Good, good. Okay, let's go, Zeta.

347
00:21:57,719 --> 00:22:00,419
Okay、もうちょっとだよ。頑張ろう、ゼータ。
Okay, just a bit more. Let's do our best, Zeta.

348
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,219
ゼータ、本気で探して。
Zeta, look for it for real.

349
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,219
Okay, okay.

350
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,519
みんなも「頑張って」って、「ゼータ頑張れ」ってコメントして！
Everyone too, say "do your best". Comment "Zeta do your best"!

351
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,219
Okay, okay, okay.

352
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,219
そういうこと。Cheer for me.
That's right. Cheer for me.

353
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:14,369
Okay, cheer for me, okay. じゃあ行くぞ。せーの、おらあ！
Okay, cheer for me, okay. Here we go. Ready, ora!

354
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:18,219
おお！おお！最後か？あ、あ、ちょっと！
Oh! Oh! Is it the last one? Ah, ah, wait!

355
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,519
ゼータ、ちょっと、ちょっと右かも。ちょっと右かも。
Zeta, wait, maybe a little to the right. Maybe a little to the right.

356
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:24,369
Just stop! Hey!

357
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:27,219
いや、ああ！Okay, okay, okay.
No, aa! Okay, okay, okay.

358
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:30,019
ゼータが頑張ってこうやって「ふう、ふう」ってやってる。
Zeta is doing her best like "phew, phew".

359
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:32,519
見える、見える？見えてきた？
Can you see, see? Is it coming into view?

360
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:33,519
うん、うん、見える。
Yeah, yeah, I see it.

361
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,019
見える、見える、見える。
I see it, see it, see it.

362
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,219
これじゃない？
Isn't it this one?

363
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,219
ああ！それですゼータ！それ！正解、正解、正解のバゾです、それは！
Aa! That's it Zeta! That! Correct, correct, that's the correct Bazo!

364
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,219
おお！いい眺めだなぁ、上から見て。
Oh! It's a nice view looking from above.

365
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,369
これ合ってるかな？
Is this correct?

366
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,519
それ合ってますよ、ゼータさん。それ合ってます。
That's correct, Zeta-san. That's correct.

367
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:51,219
おめでとう！やったー！
Congratulations! We did it!

368
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:53,519
ああ、落ちてきた。ありがとう！
Aa, it fell down. Thank you!

369
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:57,219
これ鍵だ。ゼータ、早く降りてこないと、ゼータが今度大変なことになっちゃうから。
This is the key. Zeta, if you don't come down quickly, something bad will happen to Zeta next.

370
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:00,019
下ろしてあげなきゃ。下ろすぞ。今待ってろ、ゼータ。
I have to let you down. I'm letting you down. Wait for it, Zeta.

371
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:11,019
ゼーター！

372
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:18,219
うわ！ゼータ！出てくる、出てくる。見てて、見てて。
Whoa! Zeta! She's coming out, coming out. Watch, watch.

00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,519
まあ、シニ、賢いじゃん。
Well, Sini, you're smart, aren't you?

378
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,419

00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,519
あれが求められてるものらしいですね、みなさん。
It seems like that's what's being sought after, everyone.

Yeeey!

396
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:14,519
じゃあ、もしかしてポルカ先輩、頑張ったからさ、なんか、くれないかな？
So, maybe since Polka-senpai worked hard, could I get something?

397
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,219
ええ！？「え」って何？「え」って何？
Ehh!? What's with the "eh"? What's with the "eh"?

おつサバです！
Otsu-saba-desu!

440
00:25:37,414 --> 00:25:40,114
ああ、マイスター。ゼータミンが盗まれた。
Ah, my star. The Zeta Min was stolen.

441
00:25:40,114 --> 00:25:43,114
My star... Senpai Zeta Min got stolen.

442
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:48,414
Okay, well... okay. (sigh) It's okay. I still have the key.

443
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:54,681
Aku masih punya kuncinya. Jadi, kita bakal pakai kunci ini untuk buka ruangan selanjutnya.
I still have the key. So, we will use this key
to open the next room.

444
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:58,081
I'm gonna use this key for the next room. Okay, let's go! Let's go!

The hardest one? Okay, okay.

869
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,200
You know, as a secret agent, it must be pretty tough to...

870
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:51,200
...balance properly, to find inner peace in the middle of stress.

871
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,200
Inner peace... okay, okay.

872
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,200
So, yeah, I need you to balance on one foot... wait, wait.

873
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,200
Do you have anything to put on your head maybe that you could balance on?

874
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,200
I mean, I don't have anything, I only have... I have like Baso or...

875
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,200
I have Zetamin, I guess! Oh, that'll work!

876
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,200
If I drop it, it'll... whoa! It's so heavy!

877
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,200
So heavy! So cute!

878
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,200
Okay, let's see if you can balance Zetamin on your head and stand on one foot.

879
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:30,200
Okay, on my head, and then stay on one foot.

880
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,200
Yeah... like this? Wait... yeah, yeah!

881
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,200
Wait, this is too easy! It's too easy for you!

882
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,200
How is this easy? This is not easy at all! I'm falling!

883
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,200
No, no, we gotta up the difficulty. No hands! No hands!

884
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:51,200
No hands? Okay, wait... ah-t-t-t-t!

00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,200
Whoa! Okay, okay! Can you hold it for three seconds? Does three seconds count?

886
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,200
Okay... whoa! Okay there!

887
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,200
Okay, I hope that counts! That counts! Wait, wait, I have a question.

888
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,200
Are we going to get our Zetamin in the mail for our participation?

889
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,200
Oh, yeah! Of course! I'll deliver the Zetamin personally to you.
