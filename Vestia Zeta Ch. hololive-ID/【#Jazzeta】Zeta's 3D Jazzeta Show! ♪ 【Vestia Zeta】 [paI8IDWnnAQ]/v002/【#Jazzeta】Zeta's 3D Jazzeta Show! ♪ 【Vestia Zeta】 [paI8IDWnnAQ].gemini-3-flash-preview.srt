00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,283
Aaah, the good old days

3
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:06,877
when I was performing with my friends at the jazz club.

4
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:09,112
It was so much fun!

5
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:13,434
Everyone was having their BEST time dancing, singing,

6
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:17,472
and just having the best time of their lives.

7
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:20,354
Haaa... good memories.

8
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:26,241
Now I kinda wanna watch old tapes...

9
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:28,188
Hmm...

10
00:03:28,452 --> 00:03:29,623
not this one.

11
00:03:30,147 --> 00:03:31,026
Not this...

12
00:03:31,855 --> 00:03:33,322
Okay, this one!

13
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:34,629
Yeah yeah yeah!

14
00:03:35,155 --> 00:03:36,726
This one was a blast!

15
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:39,467
I had so much fun on this one!

16
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Hmm-mm-mm...

17
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You Make Me

(Vocalizing)

20
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:38,257
You make me wanna get up in the morning

21
00:04:38,835 --> 00:04:42,148
You make me wanna stay up all night long

22
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:46,069
You make me wanna get up to be dancing

23
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:50,844
You make me wanna reach up to the sky

24
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:53,640
I feel so high

25
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:55,787
When I first met you

26
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:57,947
I already knew

27
00:04:58,384 --> 00:04:59,000
Something special has begun

28
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,333
...than I've ever knew before.
...than I've ever known before.

29
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:06,433
Was it in your eyes, feelings you can't disguise?

30
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:11,133
Something telling me that destiny knocked on my front door.

31
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:18,233
It's better to believe than to let by the happiness I feel inside.

32
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:25,533
Don't let go, I know you feel the same, let passion grow...

33
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:28,933
...and it gets better day by day.

34
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,533
You make me wanna get up in the morning.

35
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,533

You make me wanna reach up to the sky, I feel so high.

38
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:52,933
Universal love from heaven above.

39
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:57,233
Fundamentally the truth I've been searching for.

40
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:01,433
Secret rendezvous in my dreams, me and you.

41
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:06,533
Brand new feelings warm my soul like a blaze more and more.

42
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,533
Like a shield protecting me from night.

43
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:15,533
Your love makes me forget those times I was alone.

44
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:19,333
There's nothing that can touch me, oh-oh...

45
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,533
...the beauty of this love to the world.

46
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:27,833

You make me wanna get up to be dancing. Yeah!

You make me wanna reach up to the sky, I feel so high.

54
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:04,233
Can you feel this energy? Whoa-oh.

55
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,533
Synchronizing you and me. Whoa-oh.

56
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:13,233
Power of positivity. Whoa-oh.

57
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:18,033
Your electricity. Whoa-oh.

58
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:42,833
It's better to believe than to let by the happiness I feel inside.

59
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:49,733
Don't let go, I know you feel the same, let passion grow...

60
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,033
...and it gets better day by day.

61
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:56,833
You make me wanna get up in the morning.

62
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,833

77
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:35,333
How did you like it? The moves had a bit of hip-hop dance moves in it.

78
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:41,233
Was it cool? Was it cool? Was it cool? Was it cool?

So yeah, I hope you like that one. It's very groovy.

Do you guys know? Do you guys know?

I'll guess... um, okay okay.

94

唸れる月が足をくすぐる
The groaning moon tickles my feet

102
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:26,596
流れる光に沿って行ってみたら
When I try to follow the flowing light

103
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:31,557
耳に囁いた 君に届かない？
Does what I whispered in your ear not reach you?

104
00:11:32,528 --> 00:11:35,257
今手を繋いでも
Even if we hold hands now

105
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:38,301
精一杯抱きしめても
Even if I hug you as hard as I can

106

空は秋に満ちるんだ
The sky is filled with autumn

107
00:11:43,157 --> 00:11:47,168
指先でゆらゆらと
Swaying at my fingertips

108
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:53,159
その動きが止まった時計の針に飛び込んだ
That movement jumped into the hands of the clock that stopped

109
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:58,386
固まった願いさえ
Even the frozen wishes

爽やかな香りがくすぐる
A refreshing scent tickles me

115
00:12:37,386 --> 00:12:42,169
足跡合わせて歩いてみたら
When I try to walk matching our footprints

116
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:47,386
私を見ていた 君に届かない？
Does it not reach you, who was looking at me?

117
00:13:09,157 --> 00:13:13,168
ずっと手を繋いでも
Even if we hold hands forever

118
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,557
君について行ってみても 空は雨に染めるんだ
Even if I try to follow you, the sky turns to rain

119
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:24,257
君を呼び出した声
The voice that called out to you

120
00:13:24,357 --> 00:13:30,168
の形が 渇いた色濡らして
Its shape wets the parched colors

121
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,497
強く叫んだ声が
The voice that screamed out loudly

122
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:41,156
散らばった今は その言葉を
Has scattered now, those words

123
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:45,387
知ってるよ
I know

124
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:51,170

戻らない その幸せは
That happiness which won't return

127

I'm so... I'm so excited to sing this with you.

Thank you so much, Ina, for singing with me.

129
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:30,075
"Violet" has been one of my favorite songs, so I'm really happy...

130
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:34,595
...that I got to sing this, especially with you and in jazzy version as well!

131

I love Jazz, and I love you.

132

Thank you, Ina.

133
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,585
No, thank you for inviting me to sing with you, especially "Violet" too!

134
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,595
Inoseta- also I really love your singing voice, so it made me really happy...

135
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,585
...that you wanted to sing "Violet" with me.

136

指先で夜を揺らした

その動きが　止まった時計の針に踏み込んだ

蜘蛛が描いた列車　そよ風
The train drawn by the clouds, a gentle breeze

142
00:16:00,557 --> 00:16:05,557
その笑顔を　知ってるよ
I know that smile

143
00:16:08,557 --> 00:16:14,557
Da ba da da...

00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:21,057
Da ba da da...

145
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:26,557
Da ba da da...

146
00:16:26,857 --> 00:16:31,057
Da ba da da...

147
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,557
OH! What's this tape? OH! Ini kaset apa, ya? ん？このテープ、なんだろう？
OH! What's this tape? OH! What is this tape? Hmm? What is this tape?

148
00:17:47,857 --> 00:17:49,557
I don't think I've ever seen it before. Kayaknya aku belum pernah lihat ini sebelumnya. 初めて見るな。
I don't think I've ever seen it before. It seems I haven't seen this before. I'm seeing it for the first time.

149
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:51,557
Wait, let me play it! Bentar, coba aku putar! ちょっと再生してみようかな...
Wait, let me play it! Wait, let me try playing it! I think I'll try playing it...

一つ　秘密を増やしましょう
Let's increase our secrets by one

153

あなたが悪い　心は火照り
It's your fault, my heart is flushed

航海先に佇まないよ　今更
I won't linger at the destination of our voyage, not now

155

唇　優しく重ねましょう
Let's gently press our lips together

156
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:05,057
指を　素肌に這わせましょう
Let's trace our fingers along bare skin

157
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:10,057
深まる吐息　身体を乗っ取り
Deepening sighs taking over the body

158
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:16,057
枯れない薔薇のような　私をあげる
I'll give you myself, like a rose that never withers

159
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:18,557
ああ
Ah...

160
00:19:24,557 --> 00:19:29,057
Heeey! 地獄へ落ちてゆけ　そこで骨まで髄まで
Heeey! Fall down to hell, and there, until the very marrow of your bones...

161
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:34,057
愛せぬなら　一途なふりをして
If you can't love, at least pretend to be devoted

162
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:43,557
Heeey! 地獄を見るほどの　愛ならば惨めな癖に
Heeey! If it's a love enough to see hell, despite being miserable...

163
00:19:56,557 --> 00:19:58,557
Towa-sama, let's go!

164
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:02,869
…虜に飢えてた時
...When I was starving for a captive,

165
00:20:02,894 --> 00:20:07,790
夜の帳を狙いましょう
Let's aim for the curtain of night.

166
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:10,169
あいつはちょろい
That guy is easy,

167
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:12,619
この手に弱い
vulnerable to this hand.

168
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:18,469
欲の皮が張るのに見苦しすぎる
Even though he's blinded by greed, it's too unsightly.

169
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:30,969
Hey Hey Hey この世は蜃気楼
Hey Hey Hey, this world is a mirage.

170
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:36,769
噂も偏見も涙も幻でしょう
Rumors, prejudices, and tears are all probably illusions.

171
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:41,269
知らぬが仏たち
Ignorance is bliss.

172
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:44,269
溶けた手
Melted hands,

173
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:47,869
詐欺を働く 音沙汰もない
working a scam, not a word heard.

174
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:00,169
Towa-sama!

175
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:00,869
Yes!

176
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:01,869
Are you okay?

177
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:03,569
I'm okay, I'm okay!

178
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:07,869
Okay! Let's sing this part together!

179
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:09,569
Okay!

180
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:14,369
Hey Hey Hey この世は蜃気楼
Hey Hey Hey, this world is a mirage.

181
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:19,869
噂も偏見も涙も幻でしょう
Rumors, prejudices, and tears are all probably illusions.

182
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:24,569
Hey Hey Hey 地獄へ落ちてゆけ
Hey Hey Hey, fall into hell.

183
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:30,269
そこで骨の髄まで愛してるなら
If you love to the marrow of your bones down there,

184
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:34,469
いちずな振りをして
pretend to be single-minded.

185
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:39,469
Hey Hey Hey 地獄は見るほどないなど
Hey Hey Hey, there's no hell worth seeing,

186
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:43,769
満ち足りないくせに
even though you're never satisfied.

187
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:01,829
Thank you!

188
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:02,894
Thank you!

189
00:22:02,894 --> 00:22:04,355
Bye bye!

190
00:22:12,946 --> 00:22:14,357
Hi!

191
00:22:14,357 --> 00:22:18,309
How was the performance too?

192
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:20,569
It was fall, right?

193
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:23,569
Fall, fall, fall-y.

194
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:25,569
It was strictly good.

195
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:27,569
It was really cool.

196
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:30,869
I tried my best to use my deep voice for that one.

197
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:34,069
Hope you guys liked it.

198
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:37,069
Towa-sama was so freaking cool.

199
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:40,069
Towa-sama was so freaking cool.

200
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:43,569
I had so much fun singing with her.

201
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:46,569
Oh wow. Actually...

202
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:48,069
...not don't forget.

203
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:50,569
Actually, we still have a little bit of something.

204
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,669
Last time we had Zetamin...

205
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:55,369
...a bottle.

206
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:58,269
But today, we have many many cool stuff.

207
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:00,869
We have more cool stuff.

208
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:03,569
Even cooler than Zetamin.

209
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:06,069
What could it be?

210
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:08,569
Apa ya kira-kira?
I wonder what it is?

211
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:10,069
Masih ada lagi nih...
There's still more...

212
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:11,869
な！
Na!

213
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:16,569
Vestia Zeta Birthday Celebration 2024

214
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:16,569
Tada!

215
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:18,569
Wah!

216
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:22,069
Tentu saja, bukan birthday party kalau tidak iklan dulu, iya gak?
Of course, it wouldn't be a birthday party without an ad first, right?

217
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,569
Kita iklan dulu, guys.
Let's have an ad first, guys.

218
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,569
This is my merchandise! Yay!

219
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:31,569
Goods! Yay!

220
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:35,069
Isn't this really beautiful?

221
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:38,069
I really love the dress.

222
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:40,569
Do I look nice?

223
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:42,569
大人っぽいね。
It looks mature, doesn't it?

224
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:45,569
This is like, just like imagine like a spy...

225
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:48,069
...going inside a ballroom...

226
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:51,569
...having a glass of strawberry juice.

227
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:55,569
The concept is like jazz but also like spy...

228
00:23:55,569 --> 00:24:00,069
...kind of like mixed together.

229
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:02,569
So, yeah!

230
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:05,569
アルテラママ、ありがとう！
Arutera-mama, thank you!

231
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:11,069
Thank you so much for making such a beautiful illustration.

232
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:14,569
So, of course, if you see here...

233
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:18,569
...it's very rare that my theme is like red...

234
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:21,069
...because you know if you see in the back...

235
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:24,069
...I mean the stage, everything, everything is super red.

236
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:27,569
So I hope you guys like this one.

237
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:30,069
And there's still more.

238
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,569
There's still more.

239
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:33,069
There's still more.

240
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:36,569

Um, you can have, you can have elegant, elegant Zeta accompany you in your room.

255
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:09,681
Or you can bring this around.

256
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:13,181
I usually bring my acrylic stand inside like a pouch.

257
00:25:13,181 --> 00:25:17,731
So, if you find like an accessory for the pouch, it would be nice.

258
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:23,319
And it's something like, um, it says "Fancy a dance with me?" question mark.

259
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:26,581
Ooh, fancy, fancy, super fancy!

Bwah! Woah! It's a hoodie!

262
00:25:39,463 --> 00:25:43,423
So this is something you guys... I feel like you guys wanted it for a long time.

263
00:25:43,423 --> 00:25:50,081
Coz you guys were always like "Zeta, can you make us something to wear?"

264
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,563
And now we have a uniform!

265
00:25:52,563 --> 00:25:56,597
Ya nggak sih? Masak Zecretary unit sama Zegethering nggak punya seragam?
Right? How can Zecretary unit and Zegethering not have a uniform?

266
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:59,894
Tapi ini bukan seragam ya. Ini kayak cozy gitu lho.
But this isn't a uniform. This is like cozy, you know.

267
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:02,914
Enak kalau mau di rumah santai.
It's nice if you want to relax at home.

268
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:05,190
Kalau mau ke luar juga bisa.
If you want to go out, you can too.

269
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,504
Soalnya nggak terlalu formal tapi nggak terlalu casual banget ya, in between.
Because it's not too formal but not too casual, in between.

Isn't it cute?

278
00:26:36,837 --> 00:26:42,581
So the main point of this illustration is Zeta with like Bazo suit actually.

279
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:46,414
If you look at it, yeah. And it's gray, so we know it's Zeta.

280
00:26:46,414 --> 00:26:51,128
Because it's gray. Anyways, yeah.

281
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:57,734
And then, um, it has a little bit of tag in it, and the tag says "Vestia Zeta".

282
00:26:57,734 --> 00:27:02,219
So yeah, this is what it looks like.

283
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:06,582
Yeah, you can wear this in conventions, or meet and greet.

284
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:11,081
Or wherever you want to go, honestly. It's not tacky at all.

285
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:13,331
So wear it wherever. Okay, next!

286
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:18,415
Oh! It's a pocket size BaZeta plushie keychain!

287
00:27:18,415 --> 00:27:20,581

00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:23,165
Wait, that's actually so cute. That's so cute!

289
00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:30,081
That's like the drawing in, um, in the back of the hoodie, but except it's now in a plushie!

290
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,481
So we have Bazo plushie, we have the other Zeta plushie, the Friends one.

291
00:27:33,481 --> 00:27:36,934
And now we have the pocket size.

00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:03,632

309
00:28:40,913 --> 00:28:47,423
And this is the last item, it's Zecretary's Pin Me Down Pin Badge! Ooh!

310
00:28:47,423 --> 00:28:52,494
So this is a badge as a Zecretary. So I wanted something... I wanted like a tie at first.

311
00:28:52,494 --> 00:28:58,894
But then I decided on a badge because badge is more wearable.

312
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:02,914
So this badge you can put it, you can wear it um on your shirt.

313
00:29:02,914 --> 00:29:05,735
You can wear it on your bags.

314
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:12,913
Because, you know, people wear pins on their bags. You can pin this on your shoe, your socks, wherever.

315
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:16,506
This is really nice. Um, also if you have like... the original idea is for it if you have a tie,

316
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:18,893
You can like pin the badge on the tie.

317
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:23,912
Jadi kalau kalian punya dasi, kalian bisa pin di dasi gitu misalnya.
So if you have a tie, you can pin it on the tie, for example.

318
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:27,581
Atau kalian bisa pin di mana aja.
Or you can pin it anywhere.

319
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:31,337
Aku juga sebenarnya punya nih pin-pin gitu nih nih.
I actually have these pins too, look.

320
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:33,935
Aku punya... I have a pin as well.
I have... I have a pin as well.

321
00:29:33,935 --> 00:29:36,913
If you guys can see. I have the deer pin.

322
00:29:36,913 --> 00:29:40,735
You can pin it in your um belt bag if you have that.

323
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:43,734
I mean I have thigh highs but...

324
00:29:43,734 --> 00:29:48,183
Yeah, you can pin it anywhere. You can pin it in your shoes if you want and all that.

325
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:51,735
Or in your hairband? Do you have a hairband?

326
00:29:51,735 --> 00:29:55,415
Ini pin kalian jadi ini serbaguna, oke.
This is your pin, so it's versatile, okay.

327
00:29:55,415 --> 00:29:59,913
But of course, it doesn't end there, because I also...

328
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,393
...prepared three voice packs...

329
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:04,293
...for my birthday as well. Yay!

330
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:15,093

“A Spy Hired to Track Down a Prince at a Ballroom, When a Mysterious Man Approaches Her”

331
00:30:04,293 --> 00:30:06,893
So I prepared the stories for the three birthdays as well.

332
00:30:06,893 --> 00:30:09,593
I wanted different stories for each language.

333
00:30:12,816 --> 00:30:15,445
Sama yang bilang skip iklan, kalian nggak bisa skip.
To those of you saying to skip the ad, you can't skip it.

334
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:17,425
Karena kita lanjut terus!
Because we're keeping it going!

335
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:19,555
First one, situational voice in Japanese.

336
00:30:19,555 --> 00:30:22,605
So これ日本語のボイスなんだけど...
So this is a Japanese voice pack, but...

337
00:30:22,605 --> 00:30:25,775
The title is “The Runaway Princess

338
00:30:25,775 --> 00:30:28,175
Who Found Herself in a Jazz Club?”

339
00:30:28,175 --> 00:30:32,505
Yay! If you guys are unsure, there is a preview button to sneak peek the content.

340
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:35,895
So it's about a princess from a certain kingdom.

341
00:30:35,895 --> 00:30:38,385
She sneaks out of the castle

342
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:41,315
to perform as a jazz singer at the club.

343
00:30:41,315 --> 00:30:44,295
So this is really interesting. Next!

344
00:30:44,295 --> 00:30:48,425
So, the second one is a different story in English.

345
00:30:48,425 --> 00:30:51,455
It's called “A Spy Hired to Track Down

346
00:30:51,455 --> 00:30:53,395
a Prince at a Ballroom,

347
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:54,695
When a Mysterious Man Approaches Her.”

348
00:30:54,695 --> 00:30:57,575
Ooh, who could that be?

349
00:30:57,575 --> 00:31:00,765
So this is about Zeta who infiltrates a ballroom as a spy on a mission...

350
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:04,695
...searching for the prince she is targeting. Yay!

351
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:07,445
Next!

352
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:10,605
Lastly, we have something a little bit familiar, maybe you're curious.

353
00:31:10,605 --> 00:31:14,478
A different story in Bahasa Indonesia.

354
00:31:14,478 --> 00:31:18,618

464
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:13,117
最後に残されたものは
What was left at the end

465
00:40:13,317 --> 00:40:17,117
透明な正体の知れない予感と
Was a transparent, unknown premonition and

466
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:22,617
個性の残骸
The wreckage of individuality.

467
00:40:23,117 --> 00:40:26,617
それを芸術と呼べるのか
Can that be called art?

468
00:40:26,617 --> 00:40:30,117
誰にも分からない
No one knows.

469
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:33,117
頭の中はごちゃごちゃで
My head is a mess,

470
00:40:33,117 --> 00:40:36,617
不透明なままも悪くない
But staying opaque isn't so bad either.

471
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:40,117
さっき決めた私を決めた
The 'me' I decided on just now, I've decided.

472
00:40:40,117 --> 00:40:43,117
私の道
On my path.

473
00:40:43,117 --> 00:40:49,117
Ha~

474
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:56,117
幸か不幸か 感情を選んだ
Fortunately or unfortunately, I chose my emotions.

475
00:40:56,617 --> 00:41:05,117
道は情へ 続く道
The path leads to emotion...

476
00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:10,117
女王様のおなりー！
The Queen has arrived!

477
00:41:20,617 --> 00:41:24,117
私が女王様さ
I am the Queen.

478
00:41:25,117 --> 00:41:29,117
何か文句あるの？
Do you have any complaints?

479
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:33,617
私の歌えば誰もが釘付け
When I sing, everyone is captivated.

480
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:38,117
全てをひれ伏させるオーラ
An aura that makes everything bow down.

481
00:41:38,617 --> 00:41:42,617
あなたが女王様 承知しておき
You are the Queen, keep that in mind.

482
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:47,117
美しい歌声 当たり前じゃない？
A beautiful singing voice, isn't that a given?

483
00:41:47,617 --> 00:41:51,117
オーケストラさ 始めましょう
An orchestra, let's begin.

484
00:41:51,617 --> 00:41:55,117
私のミューゼ
My Muse.

485
00:41:56,117 --> 00:42:00,117
Hey know, yeah, one base

486
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:04,617
Oh ho! Drums! Whoo! Brass section!

487
00:42:05,117 --> 00:42:08,617
皆言う事をお聞き 私のために奏でなさい
Listen to what I say, play for me.

488
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:14,117
全ては私のものよ 私は女王様だからさ
Everything is mine, because I am the Queen.

489
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:18,617
ちょっと待って
Wait a minute.

490
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:24,117
これはみんなで 奏でるミュージック
This is music we all play together.

491
00:42:24,617 --> 00:42:29,617
へんてこでも まとまらなくても
Even if it's weird or disorganized,

492
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:33,617
どんな時でも ハッピーを感じてるのさ
Always feeling happy.

493
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:36,617
十人十色 だけど
Ten people, ten colors, but

494
00:42:37,117 --> 00:42:40,117
重なれば ハーモニーになる
When layered, they become harmony.

495
00:42:40,617 --> 00:42:43,117
理由は単純さ
The reason is simple,

496
00:42:43,617 --> 00:42:46,117
だって We love music
Because We love music.

497
00:42:47,117 --> 00:42:50,117
お話をしよう
Let's talk,

498
00:42:50,617 --> 00:42:55,617
昔話より
More than old stories,

499
00:42:56,117 --> 00:43:03,117
もっともっと 素敵な おとぎ話
A much more wonderful fairy tale.

500
00:43:04,617 --> 00:43:08,617
それはありふれた 魔法のフィロソフィー
It's a common magic philosophy.

501
00:43:08,617 --> 00:43:14,117
みんなのハートに 隠れた ミュージック
Music hidden in everyone's heart.

502
00:43:14,117 --> 00:43:30,117
La~

503
00:43:33,117 --> 00:43:40,117
Ha~

504
00:43:53,117 --> 00:43:56,117
Alice in Musicland

505
00:43:56,617 --> 00:43:59,617
How do you get to Musicland?

506
00:43:59,617 --> 00:44:03,117
Under the pillow, another land?

507
00:44:03,117 --> 00:44:06,117
Or just behind the tree?

508
00:44:06,617 --> 00:44:09,617
Where clouds go rolling by

509
00:44:09,617 --> 00:44:12,617
They roll away and leave the sky

510
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:16,117
Where is the land beyond the eye

511
00:44:16,117 --> 00:44:19,117
That people cannot see?

512
00:44:19,617 --> 00:44:22,617
Where do stars go?

513
00:44:22,617 --> 00:44:26,117
Where is the silver crescent moon?

514
00:44:26,617 --> 00:44:30,117
They must be somewhere

515
00:44:30,117 --> 00:44:33,117
In the sunny afternoon

516
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:36,617
Alice in Musicland

517
00:44:36,617 --> 00:44:39,617
Where is the path to Musicland?

518
00:44:40,117 --> 00:44:42,617
Over the hill or here or there?

519
00:44:42,617 --> 00:44:45,117
I really wonder where

520
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:49,117
Now we know the answer

521
00:44:49,117 --> 00:44:52,617
When we're enjoying music

522
00:44:52,617 --> 00:44:59,617
Always we're in Musicland!

523
00:44:50,117 --> 00:44:56,117
Alice in Musicland

524
00:45:09,229 --> 00:45:13,229
Yeah!

525
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:15,529
Gimana? Gimana? Gimana?
How was it? How was it? How was it?

526
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:18,629
どうでしたか？
How was it?

527
00:45:21,029 --> 00:45:23,829
Oh, I can't believe it's almost ending.

528
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,529
Almost, because it still hasn't ended, right?

529
00:45:26,629 --> 00:45:29,429
How are you guys enjoying it so far?

530
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:31,429
Are you watching it with popcorn?

531
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:34,329
Or are you watching it with something else? With coffee maybe?

532
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:37,929
Thank you everyone for coming to my birthday party because...

533
00:45:38,029 --> 00:45:43,129
Ah, I am so excited, I am so happy that my...

534
00:45:43,229 --> 00:45:47,429
...that my vision is coming to reality.

535
00:45:47,529 --> 00:45:51,429

That was really nice.

537

I hope you guys noticed my love for all things like...

538
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,829
...retro, vintage...

539
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:00,929
...and like jazz, you know?

540
00:46:01,029 --> 00:46:04,429
I've always wanted to create something like a little bit different...

541
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:08,429
...like slightly old-style jazz vibes.

542
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:14,329
Makasih semuanya udah bikin mimpi aku jadi realita, pokoknya...
Thank you everyone for making my dream a reality, basically...
