00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:50,045
You guys ready?

151
00:14:51,045 --> 00:14:52,545
Oh, ready?

152
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:53,545
Okay.

153
00:14:53,545 --> 00:14:55,545
Music start!

154
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:15,457
多分 憧れてた
Maybe I was longing for it

155
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,457
追いかけてた
Maybe I was chasing it

156
00:15:17,457 --> 00:15:19,457
いつまでもそういたかった
I wanted to stay like that forever

157
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:22,457
完璧なあなた 嫌になった
I grew to hate you, who's so perfect

158
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:28,457
同じ様に アイもらって
In the same way, I received love

159
00:15:28,457 --> 00:15:30,457
育ったのにな
Even though I grew up like that

160
00:15:30,457 --> 00:15:32,957
いつからか差が開いてた
Before I knew it, a gap had opened

161
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:36,457
八つ当たりだってしたかった
I even wanted to take it out on you

162
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:41,457
ねえ ベイビー
Hey, baby

163
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,457
神様は試練与えた
God gave me a trial

164
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:45,957
「強くなれよ」と うざいよ
“Become stronger,” he said. So annoying

165
00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:49,957
平等なんて嘘すぎ
Equality is such a lie

166
00:15:49,957 --> 00:15:52,957
分かってるけど
I know that, but...

167
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:54,457

171
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:03,957
猫かぶり
And playing innocent

172
00:16:03,957 --> 00:16:06,457
オンリーワンだよ
I'm the only one

173
00:16:06,457 --> 00:16:08,457

So please love me

174
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:10,457
生き方は無限にある

175
00:16:10,457 --> 00:16:13,457

Let’s live a life that isn’t just about the now

180
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:38,457
だって理想言えば
Because if I speak of my ideals

181
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,457
キミがいなくて
You aren't there

182
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,457
ないもの全部欲しがって
And I want everything I don't have

183
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:45,957
鏡を見たって ため息
Looking in the mirror, I sigh

184
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:52,957
あなたが悩んでいた 知らなかった
I didn't know you were struggling

185
00:16:52,957 --> 00:16:55,957
みんなと同じだとしたら
If we're all the same

186
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:58,457
ピーンと張った糸
The tightly stretched thread

187
00:16:58,457 --> 00:17:02,957

神様は楽しんでる
God is enjoying this

189
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:08,457

勉強とか
Like studying

00:17:18,457 --> 00:17:19,957
仕事とか
Like working

193
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:23,457
諦めないの 女の子だし
I won’t give up, I’m a girl after all

194
00:17:23,457 --> 00:17:25,457
元気よく
Cheerfully

00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:38,957
張り切って

I’ll go my own way

203
00:17:43,457 --> 00:17:46,457
胸張って生きる
I’ll live with my head held high

204
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:50,457

When I look up at the sky

Then if you're wondering, like, wow, when Moona's streaming...

294
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:45,069

314
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:30,081
Isn't it nice? I love it. I love it.

315
00:25:30,581 --> 00:25:33,581
Hey! Don't! No! Na-ah!

316
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:44,281
I see, I see a lot of people like want to moonwalk.

317
00:25:45,081 --> 00:25:47,881
It's been a while, I don't know how to do it.

318
00:26:00,281 --> 00:26:03,581
That's how we do it, baby!

319
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:07,581
Tapi... tapi karena ini karpet ya,
But... but because this is a carpet,

320
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:11,081
jadi kalau moonwalk itu agak-agak agak sulit...
so moonwalking is a bit, a bit difficult...

321
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:14,581
...syung syung syung gitu. It's, it's so hard but yeah.
...like that. It's, it's so hard but yeah.

322
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:19,581
Wow! Wow! It's a flawless moonwalk though.

323
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:25,581
I mean, after all, I am the celestial moon.

324
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:30,881
You want to take a screenshot?

325
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:33,881
Sure, I'm gonna... I'm gonna pose.

326
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:36,581
While pose... What is that?

327
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:39,581
Oh my God! Superchat!

328
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:44,581
I'm gonna pose while I get a superchat then. Hya!

329
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:57,581
Wa! There's a lot of superchat coming! What is this?

330
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:09,581
Oh! Whoa! I got balls in my hand! I got balls in my hand!

331
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:15,581
There's a lot of balls in my room! And I'm liking it. Yeah!

332
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:23,581
Glistening balls. Nice, isn't it?

333
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:32,581
Okay. I, I have a lot of things, you know.

334
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:35,581
I cannot... I cannot look all of the superchat.

335
00:27:35,681 --> 00:27:38,281
So I'm gonna keep it. I'm gonna keep it.

336
00:27:38,381 --> 00:27:39,881
And I will sing a lot more for you.

337
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:43,281
But, I think my head a little bit dizzy

338
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:45,581
because of the... of the balls.

339
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,581
Probably the balls is come to me so...

340
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:51,581
Whoa!

341
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:32,281
Look up at the night sky, what do you see?

342
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:38,881
The glowing beauty in the twilight and the mystery.

343
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:41,281
Know what's a fantasy and light it all up.

344
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:44,581
When the time has come, I'll be rising high.

345
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:47,581
No form like a lifeline,

346
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:50,581
but never you'll see my shine.

347
00:28:50,681 --> 00:28:56,581
I... I will catch your eye.

348
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,281
It's pulling you in, like gravity.

349
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:07,581
You will be bowing on your knees, yeah,

it's pulling you in, so close to me.

351

My rain will never stop,

353
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:19,881
the dawn begins to rise to the top.

354
00:29:19,981 --> 00:29:23,281
Let my power entwine,

355
00:29:23,381 --> 00:29:26,581
following me like the high tide.

356
00:29:32,581 --> 00:29:36,581
I can be your bright enigma, it's no surprise.

357
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:41,881
But you give me into the brilliance,

358
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:44,281
like a moth to a light.

359
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:47,281
Pray hard to get but I'm patient,

360
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:50,581

00:29:55,681 --> 00:30:00,081
My shine.

363
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,393
And the moon just sighs

364
00:30:06,093 --> 00:30:07,493
It's pulling you in

365
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:09,193
like gravity

366
00:30:09,593 --> 00:30:12,193
You will be bowing on your knees, yeah

367
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:13,993
It's pulling you in

368
00:30:14,393 --> 00:30:15,593
close to me

369
00:30:15,893 --> 00:30:17,393
Watch my glory and my

370
00:30:17,593 --> 00:30:19,493
power will be like the high tide

371
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:21,893
My reign will never stop

372
00:30:22,093 --> 00:30:24,493
The tide begins to rise

373
00:30:24,693 --> 00:30:26,193
up to the top

374
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:28,093
Let my power

375
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:33,293
and my power we'll be like the high tide

376
00:30:33,593 --> 00:30:37,393
we'll be like the high tide

377
00:30:41,593 --> 00:30:44,293
I shine so bright

378
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,393
and deep in the night

379
00:30:47,593 --> 00:30:53,093
the way the waves come tonight

380
00:31:40,093 --> 00:31:55,093
(Vocalizing)

381
00:31:57,493 --> 00:31:59,593
Moona! Bangun!
Moona! Wake up!

382
00:32:00,393 --> 00:32:03,493
(Moona wakes up)

383
00:32:03,693 --> 00:32:04,593
Where am I?

384
00:32:05,193 --> 00:32:06,193
Moona di mana?
Where's Moona?

385
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:07,093
Risu!

386
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:11,893
Moona! Kamu... Oh my god. Kamu tahu?
Moona! You... Oh my god. You know?

387

Kamu harus terbangun secara menyeluruh.
You have to wake up completely.

388
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:19,693
Maka dari itu kita harus bernyanyi sekali lagi.
Therefore, we have to sing one more time.

389
00:32:21,393 --> 00:32:23,293
Kalau gitu, gimana kalau kita nyanyi...
In that case, how about we sing...

390
00:32:23,793 --> 00:32:25,893
Preserved Roses!

391

短(みじか)い夢(ゆめ)を重(かさ)ねて
Stacking short dreams upon one another

392
00:32:36,093 --> 00:32:39,593
永遠(えいえん)に満(み)ちてゆく花(はな)の
Of flowers that bloom for eternity

393
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:42,593
偽(いつわ)りと重(かさ)ならない
They don't overlap with falsehoods

394
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:45,393
押(お)し込(こ)めたい命(いのち)の
The lives I want to lock away

孤独(こどく)を君(きみ)に捧(ささ)げる
I offer this loneliness to you

396
00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:53,093
Preserved Roses

Preserved Roses
Lyrics: Akio Inoue  Composition: Daisuke Asakura

398
00:32:56,193 --> 00:32:58,793
身体(からだ)の奥(おく)溢(あふ)れて
Overflowing from deep within my body

399
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:00,793
本物(ほんもの)の鼓動(こどう)さえ
Even my true heartbeat

400
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:03,793
描(えが)いている風景(ふうけい)に
In the scenery I'm drawing

401
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:07,493
全(すべ)てが詰(つ)めたい吐息(といき)になって
Everything becomes a cold sigh

402
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:11,393
汚(けが)さないで
Don't stain it

403
00:33:12,393 --> 00:33:15,793
光(ひかり)絶(た)やす方(ほう)へ
Towards the side where light fades

404
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:18,493
どちらにでも行(い)ける
I can go either way

405
00:33:18,793 --> 00:33:22,493
怖(こわ)がらないで
Don't be afraid

406
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:26,593
望(のぞ)まない明日(あした)はもう来(こ)ない
The tomorrow I don't want will no longer come

407
00:33:26,793 --> 00:33:29,493
鮮(あざ)やかなだけを繰(く)り返(かえ)し
Repeating only the vivid moments

408
00:33:29,693 --> 00:33:32,493
長(なが)い終(お)わりに君(きみ)はまた
In the long end, you again...

409
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:35,893
短(みじか)い夢(ゆめ)を重(かさ)ねて
Stacking short dreams upon one another

410
00:33:36,093 --> 00:33:39,493
永遠(えいえん)に満(み)ちてゆく花(はな)の
Of flowers that bloom for eternity

411
00:33:39,693 --> 00:33:42,593
偽(いつわ)りと重(かさ)ならず
They don't overlap with falsehoods

412
00:33:42,793 --> 00:33:45,393
この世界(せかい)を傷(きず)つける
Hurting this world

413
00:33:45,593 --> 00:33:48,393
願(ねが)うなら見(み)せてくれる
If you wish, they'll show you

414
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,393
宝物(たからもの)は消(き)えないで
May your treasures never vanish

415
00:33:51,593 --> 00:33:54,493
君(きみ)が見(み)る明日(あした)の
Of the tomorrow that you see

416
00:33:54,693 --> 00:33:57,393
新(あたら)しい息吹(いぶき)を
A new breath of life

417
00:33:57,593 --> 00:34:00,293
伸(の)ばした腕(うで)に迎(むか)える
Welcoming into your outstretched arms

418
00:34:00,493 --> 00:34:04,693
離(はな)さない
I won't let go

419
00:34:05,193 --> 00:34:08,793
欲(ほ)しいまま溶(と)け出(だ)す
Melting away as desired

420
00:34:09,093 --> 00:34:10,793
熱(あつ)い場所(ばしょ)探(さぐ)る思(おも)い
Feelings searching for a heated place

421
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:13,793
国(くに)無(な)き者(もの)の微笑(ほほえ)みに
In the smile of a stateless person

422
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,393
誘(いざな)われながら
While being beckoned

423
00:34:17,593 --> 00:34:21,393
汚(けが)れてしまう前(まえ)に
Before it gets stained

424
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,793
ときめいた抗(あらが)いこぼれて
A fluttering resistance spills over

425
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:28,393
火(ひ)を放(はな)つ蜜(みつ)に華(はな)やかに
Vividly in the nectar that catches fire

426
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:32,493
鼓動(こどう)を映(うつ)し出(だ)せるなら
If my heartbeat can be reflected...

427
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:36,593
激(はげ)しい色(いろ)を注(そそ)いで
Pour in intense colors

428
00:34:36,793 --> 00:34:39,493
掻(か)き乱(みだ)した幻(まぼろし)を
The disturbed illusion

429
00:34:39,693 --> 00:34:42,593
君(きみ)が信(しん)じるなら
If you believe in it

430
00:34:42,793 --> 00:34:45,393
真実(しんじつ)だって越(こ)えるだろう
It will probably even surpass the truth

431
00:34:45,593 --> 00:34:48,393
移(うつ)ろう影(かげ)を止(と)めて
Stopping the shifting shadows

432
00:34:48,593 --> 00:34:51,393
狂(くる)う術(すべ)も知(し)らないで
Without knowing even how to go mad

433
00:34:51,593 --> 00:34:54,493
血(ち)を探(さが)し染(そ)めたその手(て)は
Those hands that searched for and stained with blood

434
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,393
押(お)し込(こ)めたい命(いのち)の
The lives I want to lock away

00:34:57,593 --> 00:35:00,081
孤独(こどく)を君(きみ)に捧(ささ)げる
I offer this loneliness to you

436
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:01,905
Oh...

Sepertinya, Moona sudah tersucikan!
It seems Moona has been purified!

00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:01,905
Mantap!
Awesome!

443
00:36:11,905 --> 00:36:15,605

Wih... Again, again, again. Do you know why I chose Preserved Rose?

444
00:36:15,905 --> 00:36:16,905
Kenapa?
Why?

445
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:18,405
Pengen aja sih.
I just felt like it.

446
00:36:18,605 --> 00:36:19,705
Wah... Biar-biar bangun gitu kan?
Wow... So you'd wake up, right?

447

Iya biar bangun, biar "wah" gitu kan ya? Iya.
Yeah, to wake up, to be like "wow", right? Yeah.

448
00:36:23,205 --> 00:36:25,105
Iya. Lagian kayaknya keren banget kalau...
Yeah. Besides, I thought it would be really cool if...

449
00:36:25,205 --> 00:36:29,105
...Preserved Rose kita kan nyanyi. Ya udah, kita nyanyikan saja.
...we sang Preserved Rose. So, we just sang it.

450
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,105
Betul!
Correct!

451
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:33,905
Iya. Anyway, ini kan kita lagi berdua nih.
Yeah. Anyway, we are here together.

452
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:37,105
Mumpung berdua, boleh lah kita promosi teman kita besoknya.
While we're together, let's promote our friend for tomorrow.

453
00:36:37,205 --> 00:36:39,105
Dia juga 3D showcase loh.
She's also having a 3D showcase.

454
00:36:39,205 --> 00:36:42,105
So tomorrow, our other friends...

00:36:42,205 --> 00:36:45,305
...are gonna do a 3D showcase.

456
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:47,405
Siapa nih? Ada siapa besok?

Yeay!

459
00:36:53,705 --> 00:36:55,305
Kalau begitu, karena Moona sudah bangun...
In that case, since I've woken up...

460
00:36:55,405 --> 00:36:56,005
He-eh.
Mm-hmm.

461
00:36:56,105 --> 00:36:57,505
Saatnya Risu, adios!
It's time for Risu, adios!

Risu cukup semangat juga ya.
Risu was quite energetic too.

466
00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:11,905
Semoga nanti 3D showcase-nya juga semangat. Oke.
Hopefully the next 3D showcase will also be energetic. Okay.

467
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,605
Moona juga masih semangat nih.
I'm still energetic too.

468
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:18,105
Jadi semoga kalian masih bersemangat ya?
So I hope you guys are still energetic too?

469
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:20,605
Kita nikmati acara malam ini.
Let's enjoy tonight's event.

470
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,105
Selanjutnya, Moona pengen nyanyi lagi nih.
Next, I want to sing again.

471
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:25,605
You guys ready? Palette.

472
00:37:41,205 --> 00:37:44,105
かすみに吹かれて
Blown by the mist

473
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:47,205
立ち止まり気づいたよ
I stopped and realized

474
00:37:47,405 --> 00:37:50,005
区別つかない
Inseparable

475
00:37:50,205 --> 00:37:52,905
モノクロの世界
In this monochrome world

476
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,705
彩色しても
Even if I color it

477
00:37:55,905 --> 00:37:58,705
何も見えなくて
I can't see anything

478
00:37:58,905 --> 00:38:01,705
まるで私は
It's as if I

479
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,905
息を止めていた
Had stopped breathing

480
00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:10,505
もういいよ
It's okay now

481
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:12,505
遠くても
Even if it's far

482
00:38:12,605 --> 00:38:14,505
叶えたい
I want it to come true

483
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:16,205
私は
I...

484
00:38:16,305 --> 00:38:18,005
壊れた世界
The broken world

485
00:38:18,105 --> 00:38:19,505
想いも
And my feelings

486
00:38:19,605 --> 00:38:22,405
抱きしめていたいのに
I want to keep holding them

487
00:38:22,605 --> 00:38:25,405
夢見たキャンバスに
On the canvas of my dreams

488
00:38:25,605 --> 00:38:28,405
描き続ける意味は
The meaning of continuing to draw

489
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:30,705
この胸に
Is within my heart

490
00:38:30,905 --> 00:38:33,105
輝いている
Shining bright

491
00:38:33,305 --> 00:38:36,605
証に
As proof

492
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:48,705
与えることに
In giving

493
00:38:48,905 --> 00:38:51,905
意味などないけど
There's no meaning, but

494
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:54,705
古い上着は
This old jacket

495
00:38:54,905 --> 00:38:57,905
脱ぎ捨ててしまおう
I'll cast it aside

496
00:38:58,305 --> 00:39:00,405
壊してよ
Destroy it

497
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:03,405
その冷たさを
That coldness

498
00:39:03,605 --> 00:39:07,105
溶かして手を伸ばした
Melt it and reach out your hand

499
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:10,505
もういいよ
It's okay now

500
00:39:10,605 --> 00:39:11,705
遠くても
Even if it's far

501
00:39:11,905 --> 00:39:13,405
届けたい
I want to reach you

502
00:39:13,605 --> 00:39:15,405
私は
I...

503
00:39:15,605 --> 00:39:17,405
受け止めてく
I'll accept it

504
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,905
涙も
Even the tears

505
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:21,705
抱きしめていたいのに
I want to keep holding them

506
00:39:21,905 --> 00:39:24,705
夢見たキャンバスに
On the canvas of my dreams

507
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:27,705
心込めるのは
Pouring my heart into it

508
00:39:27,905 --> 00:39:30,105
この空に
In this sky

509
00:39:30,305 --> 00:39:32,405
描き足してく
Continuing to paint

510
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:36,105
証に
As proof

511
00:39:45,205 --> 00:39:47,405
壊してよ
Destroy it

512
00:39:47,605 --> 00:39:50,405
その冷たさを
That coldness

513
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:54,105
溶かして手を伸ばした
Melt it and reach out your hand

514
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:58,405
もういいよ
It's okay now

515
00:39:58,605 --> 00:39:59,705
遠くても
Even if it's far

516
00:39:59,805 --> 00:40:01,105
叶えたい
I want it to come true

517
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:02,917
私のこの世界
This world of mine

518
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:05,917
想いも言葉まで包んで
Wrapped in thoughts and even words

519
00:40:08,817 --> 00:40:10,617
夢の境界線に
On the border of dreams

520
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:13,617
色を足していく
Adding color

521
00:40:14,317 --> 00:40:16,617
この胸に
In this heart

522
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:19,317
今輝いて
Shining now

523
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,417
強くなくてもいい
It's okay not to be strong

524
00:40:22,617 --> 00:40:25,117
壊れかけてもいい
It's okay to be broken

525
00:40:25,417 --> 00:40:27,917
この心は
This heart of mine

526
00:40:28,117 --> 00:40:30,617
永遠に羽ばたいて
Will fly forever

527
00:40:31,317 --> 00:40:33,917
響くように
So it resonates

528
00:40:34,117 --> 00:40:37,917
塗り替えていくパレット
The palette is being repainted

529
00:41:00,317 --> 00:41:02,617
Oh! 楽しかった!
Oh! That was fun!

530
00:41:05,317 --> 00:41:07,617
トワ様ありがとうございます!
Thank you, Towa-sama!

531
00:41:07,817 --> 00:41:10,617

533

Congratulations!

534
00:41:19,517 --> 00:41:23,117
You know, today, to sing your original song Palette...

535
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:24,617
Oh my God, I'm so excited.

536
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:27,317
Palette is one of my favorite Hololive songs.

537
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:31,317
Because I always, usually... it's on my karaoke playlist.

538
00:41:31,517 --> 00:41:34,117
So singing with you it's like...

539
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,617

Together singing!

544
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:47,917
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

545
00:41:54,317 --> 00:41:56,617
Oh my God, thank you so much, I'm so nervous.

546
00:41:56,817 --> 00:42:00,117
You know, when I first invited you since... since you were on a break.

547
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:03,617
So thank you so much for making time for me. Thank you.

548
00:42:04,317 --> 00:42:06,617
いやいっぱい Thank you やん。
No, I should be saying thank you a lot.

Many many thank you. こちらこそ。
Many many thanks. Same here.

550
00:42:13,117 --> 00:42:16,317
いやね、ムーナに誘われて一緒に歌おうって...

551
00:42:16,517 --> 00:42:19,617
言ってくれて本当にもう嬉しかったよ。ありがとう。

まあ、ムーナまだ歌うんでしょ? いっぱいね?
Well, Moona, you're still going to sing more, right? A lot?

555
00:42:31,517 --> 00:42:35,117
ということで皆さんまだまだたくさん聴いていってくださいね。
So everyone, please continue to listen a lot.

556
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:37,617
トワはここでバイバイ! ムーナ頑張って!

めちゃめちゃ Thank you so much トワ様。
Thank you so, so much, Towa-sama.

559
00:42:48,617 --> 00:42:51,317
Next, I want to sing a song.

560
00:42:51,517 --> 00:42:54,317
Moona pengen nyanyi lagu...
Moona wants to sing a song...

561
00:42:54,517 --> 00:42:57,117
...ini lagu dari Indonesia.
...this is a song from Indonesia.

562
00:42:57,317 --> 00:43:00,317
So this song is from Indonesia.

563
00:43:00,517 --> 00:43:03,317
And I want to show you to the overseas...

564
00:43:03,517 --> 00:43:06,317
...for Japan also to hear this Indonesian song.

565
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:09,317
I hope you guys enjoy it.

566
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:14,917
Next song is...

567
00:43:15,117 --> 00:43:16,617
Matahariku.

568
00:43:20,617 --> 00:43:25,117
Matahariku.

569
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:30,617
Tertutup sudah pintu hatiku
The door to my heart is closed

570
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,617
Yang pernah dibuka waktu
That was once opened by time

571
00:43:33,817 --> 00:43:36,617
Hanya untukmu
Only for you

572
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:41,317
Kini kau pergi dari hidupku
Now you've gone from my life

573
00:43:41,517 --> 00:43:44,917
Kuharus relakanmu
I must let you go

574
00:43:45,117 --> 00:43:48,617
Walau aku tak mampu
Even though I can't

575
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:58,617
Tercurah warna pelangi
Rainbow colors poured out

576
00:43:58,817 --> 00:44:01,917
Di dalam hati
Inside the heart

577
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:05,317
Sejenak luluh hening
For a moment, melting into silence

578
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,617
Menjauh pergi
Going far away

579
00:44:08,917 --> 00:44:12,317
Tak ada lagi cahaya suci
There's no more sacred light

580
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:15,917
Semua t'lah beranjak
Everything has moved on

581
00:44:16,117 --> 00:44:19,617
Aku terdiam sepi
I'm standing in silence

582
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:29,917
Dengarlah matahariku
Listen, my sun

583
00:44:30,117 --> 00:44:33,317
Suara tangisanku
The sound of my crying

584
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:36,917
Kubersedih
I'm sad

585
00:44:37,117 --> 00:44:40,917
Karena panah cintamu
Because your arrow of love

586
00:44:41,117 --> 00:44:44,117
Menusuk jantungku
Pierced my heart

587
00:44:44,317 --> 00:44:47,617
Kuucapkan matahariku
I say, my sun

588
00:44:47,817 --> 00:44:51,317
Puisi tentang hidupku
The poem about my life

589
00:44:51,517 --> 00:44:54,917
Tentangku
About me

590
00:44:55,117 --> 00:44:59,117
Yang tak mampu menanggung kobaranmu
Who can't bear your blaze

591
00:45:07,529 --> 00:45:14,729
Hempaslah warna gelap di dalam hati
Away with the dark colors in the heart

592
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:21,629
Sejenak kuharap kau menjauh pergi
For a moment I hope you go far away

593
00:45:22,629 --> 00:45:28,329
Tak ada lagi cahaya suci
No more holy light

594
00:45:29,129 --> 00:45:43,629
Semua nada beranjak aku terdiam sepi
All tones move away, I'm left in silence

595
00:46:00,629 --> 00:46:12,429
Dengarkanlah Matahariku
Listen, my Sun

596
00:46:13,529 --> 00:46:18,929
Dengarlah Matahariku suara tangisanku
Hear, my Sun, the sound of my cry

597
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:27,629
Kubersedih karena panah cinta menusuk jantungku
I am sad because the arrow of love pierces my heart

598
00:46:34,129 --> 00:46:40,329
Dengarlah Matahariku suara tangisanku
Hear, my Sun, the sound of my cry

599
00:46:40,929 --> 00:46:48,129
Kubersedih karena panah cinta menusuk jantungku
I am sad because the arrow of love pierces my heart

600
00:46:48,729 --> 00:46:55,329
Cahaya Matahariku
My sunlight

601
00:46:55,529 --> 00:47:00,629
Puisi tentang hidupku
A poem about my life

602
00:47:00,929 --> 00:47:08,629
Tentangku yang tak mampu menaklukkan waktu
About me who is unable to conquer time

603
00:47:17,729 --> 00:47:23,929
Dengarlah Matahariku suara tangisanku
Hear, my Sun, the sound of my cry

604
00:47:24,329 --> 00:47:35,629
Kubersedih karena panah cinta menusuk jantungku
I am sad because the arrow of love pierces my heart

605
00:48:27,129 --> 00:48:52,129
Now Loading

606
00:49:47,429 --> 00:49:51,129
（笑い声）
(Laughter)

607
00:49:51,929 --> 00:49:52,929
ムマ...
Mooma...

608
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:56,329
ムーナだよー
It's Moona!

609
00:49:57,129 --> 00:49:59,929
パギパギー、ハッ
Morning, morning! Hah!

610
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:23,141
Now Loading ...

611
00:50:01,441 --> 00:50:03,141
Ih gimana ya?
Oh, how should I do it?

612
00:50:04,341 --> 00:50:05,641
Malam Moona!
Good evening, Moona!

613
00:50:07,641 --> 00:50:09,141
Hachi-desu, pagi ini...
Hachi-desu, this morning...

614
00:50:09,641 --> 00:50:11,141
Menang!
I won!

615
00:50:12,241 --> 00:50:15,141
Okay okay okay, ini kita kapan keluarnya ya?
Okay, okay, okay, when are we going out?

616
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:22,641
Okay kalau gitu Moona duluan, asyemona, bye bye!
Okay, then Moona will go first, asyemona, bye bye!

617
00:50:40,141 --> 00:50:50,141
Ha ha ha ha...

618
00:50:50,641 --> 00:50:58,141
Ha ha ha ha...

619
00:51:15,641 --> 00:51:18,641
Warna-warna yang terlihat
The colors that are seen

620
00:51:18,941 --> 00:51:23,141
Diriku mahir sembunyi rasa
I am skilled at hiding feelings

621
00:51:24,641 --> 00:51:27,641
Sebenarnya hitam pekat
In truth, it is pitch black

622
00:51:28,141 --> 00:51:32,641
Kututup rapat jadi rahasia
I close it tight, making it a secret

623
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:37,141
Satu dua kali kutak apa-apa
One or two times, I am fine

624
00:51:37,341 --> 00:51:41,641
Kamu pikir hidupku baik-baik saja
You think my life is just fine

625
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:46,641
Siapa yang peduli punya air mata
Who cares about having tears

626
00:51:47,141 --> 00:51:52,141
Kamu hanya pinta diri berikan tawa
You only ask of me to give laughter

627
00:51:53,141 --> 00:51:59,141
Ha ha ha ha...

628
00:52:00,141 --> 00:52:02,641
Wajah yang kuberi perisai jitu
The face I give is a precise shield

629
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:08,641
Ha ha ha ha...

630
00:52:09,141 --> 00:52:11,641
Sampai-sampai kau begitu
Even to the point that you are like that

631
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:18,141
Malam hari berkelana
Wandering at night

632
00:52:18,641 --> 00:52:23,141
Pikiran liar ku juaranya
I am the champion of wild thoughts

633
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,641
Bukannya ku tak berusaha
It's not that I don't try

634
00:52:28,141 --> 00:52:32,141
Ingin kulepas sekuat tenaga
I want to let go with all my strength

635
00:52:33,141 --> 00:52:36,141
Satu dua kali kutak apa-apa
One or two times, I am fine

636
00:52:37,141 --> 00:52:41,641
Kamu pikir hidupku baik-baik saja
You think my life is just fine

637
00:52:42,641 --> 00:52:45,641
Siapa yang peduli punya air mata
Who cares about having tears

638
00:52:46,141 --> 00:52:51,641
Kamu hanya pinta diri berikan tawa
You only ask of me to give laughter

639
00:52:52,141 --> 00:52:58,641
Ha ha ha ha...

640
00:52:59,141 --> 00:53:02,141
Wajah yang kuberi perisai jitu
The face I give is a precise shield

641
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:08,141
Ha ha ha ha...

642
00:53:08,641 --> 00:53:10,641
Sampai-sampai kau begitu
Even to the point that you are like that

643
00:53:11,641 --> 00:53:15,641
Aku bulan yang terangi
I am the moon that illuminates

644
00:53:16,141 --> 00:53:20,641
Malam-malammu yang sepi
Your lonely nights

645
00:53:21,641 --> 00:53:24,641
Lalu siapa yang temani
Then who accompanies

646
00:53:25,141 --> 00:53:32,141
Rasa gelisah kupikul sendiri
The feeling of anxiety I carry alone

647
00:53:52,641 --> 00:53:58,641
Ha ha ha ha...

648
00:53:59,141 --> 00:54:02,141
Wajah yang kuberi perisai jitu
The face I give is a precise shield

649
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:08,141
Ha ha ha ha...

650
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:11,641
Sampai-sampai kau begitu
Even to the point that you are like that

651
00:54:12,641 --> 00:54:18,141
Ha ha ha ha...

652
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:21,141
Wajah yang kuberi perisai jitu
The face I give is a precise shield

653
00:54:21,641 --> 00:54:26,641
Ha ha ha ha...

654
00:54:27,141 --> 00:54:31,141
Sampai-sampai kau begitu
Even to the point that you are like that

655
00:54:54,141 --> 00:54:56,641
