00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:54,008
Your action and your words would never match

50
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:57,008
You're just a piece of trash, and that's a fact

51
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:58,508
Who's toxic? It's you!

52
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:02,008
Okay everyone, this is "Who's Toxic? It's You!"

53
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:05,508
You made me feel that I'm not good enough

54
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:08,508
I gave you my best, but you're not impressed

55
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:18,008
It's falls apart, you broke my heart

56
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:20,508
You're spreading more lies and lies and lies

57
00:08:20,508 --> 00:08:24,008
I had enough, cut it out, I am begging no more

58
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:25,508
Sing with me!

59
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:29,008
It's you the one who spread the words that I am fake

60
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,008
It's you the one who stabbed me right in the back

61
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:35,008
And now you say that I'm misread

62
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:38,208
But I don't even really care anyway

63
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,808
It's you who did some things but then I took the blame

64
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:45,008
It's you who mess around and do a hits and runs

65
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:48,208
You made my days a living hell

66
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,508
Now I don't care, who's toxic? It's you!

67
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:55,508
Welcome to the Eclipse Breaker!

68
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:58,508
Even though you're watching me on the screen,

69
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:00,008
but I still want to hear you scream!

70
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:01,008
Can't hear you!

71
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,008
Can't hear you!

72
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,508
Can't hear you!

73
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,008
It's bullshit!

74
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:13,508
It's bullshit!

75
00:09:13,508 --> 00:09:15,508
It's bullshit!

76
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,508
It's falls apart, you broke my heart

77
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:22,508
You're spreading more lies and lies and lies

78
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:27,008
I had enough, cut it out, I am begging no more

79
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:31,008
It's you the one who tried to make me go insane

80
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:34,008
It's you who should stop and feel a shame

81
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:37,008
I see your lies, it's all in vain

82
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:39,508
I better just ignore it anyway

83
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:43,008
It's you the one who turned my world upside down

84
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:46,508
It's you who break the rules and pull me under the bus

85
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:49,008
Just go away, that you can't stay

86
00:09:49,008 --> 00:09:51,008
Just go to hell

87
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,008
Now tell me why...

88
00:09:54,508 --> 00:10:00,008
You make me question my reality

89
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:03,508
Now I have the lesson learned

90
00:10:03,508 --> 00:10:05,008
This is all I need to know

91
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:07,336
It's you...

92
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:09,836
the one who makes me feel that I am weak...

93
00:10:09,836 --> 00:10:12,536
Your words hit so hard make me black and blue

94
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:15,136
I know the truth but you deny

95
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:17,836
Who cares about it anyway?

96
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:21,336
It's you the one who spreads the lies with any flag

97
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:24,336
It's you the one who does the sins and never regret

98
00:10:24,336 --> 00:10:26,536
I have to warn you, you know this karma

99
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:29,036
I need no drama

100
00:10:29,036 --> 00:10:31,536
So who's toxic, it's you!

101
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,036
Screw this!

102
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:39,236
Screw this!

103
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:40,536
Screw this!

104
00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:50,336
I don't care

105
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:52,536
I don't care

106
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:56,036
Who's toxic, it's you!

107
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:08,336
Hoo! Guys!

108
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,136
You are on fire guys!

109
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:19,036
Akhirnya! Akhirnya kita melakukan 3D lagi guys...
Finally! Finally we're doing a 3D live again guys...

110
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:23,536
...setelah menunggu beberapa tahun lamanya ya guys.
...after waiting for quite a few years.

111
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:31,036
Buat kalian yang ingin ikut menghype stream ini,
For those of you who want to hype up this stream,

112
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:35,336
kalian bisa pakai hashtag #EclipseBreaker3DLive.

113
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:40,036
3D LIVE!

114
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,836
Sebelum itu, Moona mau ngenalin nih guys.
Before that, Moona wants to introduce something.

115
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:49,036
Kalau misalnya kalian lihat nih di belakangnya Moona ya...
If you look behind Moona...

116
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,536
Wow! Kece banget banget banget ya guys.
Wow! It's really, really cool, guys.

117
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:58,036
Apalagi nih Moona paling suka monitornya guys.
Especially, Moona loves the monitor the most.

118
00:11:58,536 --> 00:12:01,536
Soalnya monitornya itu guys, uh, bulan banget.
Because the monitor is, uh, very moon-like.

119
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:07,036
Everything in here is Moona Hoshinova coordination.

120
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:11,036
Belum lagi nih guys, belum lagi nih.
Not only that, guys. Not only that.

121
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:14,536
Kalau misalnya kalian lihat ya guys di belakangnya Moona ya guys...
If you look behind Moona, guys...

122
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:18,536
We have the Monavitas!

123
00:12:24,436 --> 00:12:29,036
They are kind of... kind of shy right now so they didn't move anything.

124
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:33,536
They just like want to be a pose of a robot-y. So...

125
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:39,836
Gimana? Kalian suka nggak sama nyanyi-nyanyiannya Moona?
How is it? Do you like Moona's singing?

126
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:43,536
Semoga kalian suka ya, karena ya
I hope you like it, because actually

127
00:12:43,536 --> 00:12:48,536
sebenarnya cukup capek ya Moona loncat-loncat dari tadi.
Moona's quite tired from jumping around since earlier.

128
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:53,536
Tapi, kita masih ada lagu-lagu nih buat kalian.
But, we still have more songs for you.

129
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:58,336
Sebelum kita pindah ke lagu selanjutnya, Moona ganti baju dulu ya.
Before we move on to the next song, Moona will change her clothes first.

130
00:12:59,036 --> 00:13:00,436
Tunggu sebentar ya!
Wait a moment!

131
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:15,036
Gimana nih? Wow! Wow! Wow!
How about this? Wow! Wow! Wow!

132
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:19,536
Gimana? Bajunya bagus banget ya guys. Eclipse Breaker.
How is it? The shirt is really good, guys. Eclipse Breaker.

133
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:31,036
Di lagu kali ini Moona akan nyanyi lagu-lagu yang agak-agak nge-band dikit guys.
In this next song, Moona will sing songs that are a bit more band-like.

134
00:13:32,136 --> 00:13:37,036
Soalnya kita konsepnya itu ala-ala band gitu biar live-nya berasa banget.
Because our concept is like a band, so the live feel is really strong.

135
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:41,536
Jadi kita akan mulai dengan...
So we will start with...

136
00:13:42,736 --> 00:13:46,536
Na na na na na... I got Deja Vu.

137
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:51,036
We're gonna start with DEJAVU!

138
00:13:52,036 --> 00:13:54,536
I hope you guys are ready.

139
00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:13,536
Na na na na na... I got Deja Vu...

140
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:21,536
It's been many years I'm thinking

141
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:24,036
how effortlessly we should be together

142
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:27,036
The beginning it was sweet but it's a shame

143
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:29,536
how quickly it turned sour

144
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,836
You let the good things slip away

145
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:33,836
I waited for hours

146
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:35,836
you would lead me astray

147
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:37,336
While you lied on her bed

148
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:38,536
Oh no...

149
00:14:38,536 --> 00:14:40,536
Now I'm done...

150
00:14:40,536 --> 00:14:44,536
we were never meant to be but oh...

151
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:48,336
I got Deja Vu me and you

152
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:50,536
never got to finish what we started

153
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:53,336
How you always want to somebody new

154
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:55,536
had me broken hearted

155
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:58,336
But I realized you were no good

156
00:14:58,336 --> 00:15:01,336
now I'm gonna look back to laugh about it

157
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:03,836
I'm so glad that we are through

158
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,036
I got Deja Vu, you're so crazy...

159
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:07,459
Did you think of me?

160
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:08,859
Did I have your full attention?

161
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:10,559
But I wasn't the only one.

162
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,359
Guess you just forgot to mention.

163
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,259
I'm so over it.

164
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:18,359
Thank god I dodged a bullet.

165
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:20,359
Made so many mistakes,

166
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:23,359
but they made me who I am.

167
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:24,559
I'm alright.

168
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:30,059
That's a lot of better, better oh...

169
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:34,159
I got deja vu, me and you.

170
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:36,559
Never got the finish what we started.

171
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,059
How you always run to somebody new.

172
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:41,059
Had me brokenhearted.

173
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:43,459
But I realized you were no good.

174
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:45,559
Now I'm gonna fight to laugh about it.

175
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:49,059
I'm so glad that we are through.

176
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:50,859
And I get deja vu.

177
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:52,859
Nothing stayed the same.

178
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:54,559
And I yet played your game.

179
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:00,059
I have no complaints because you made me who I am.

180
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,559
Looking back and smile.

181
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,559
Can't believe how far I've come.

182
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,059
What was I thinking?

183
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:08,359
It got me singing.

184
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:10,759
I got deja vu, me and you.

185
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:13,059
Never got the finish what we started.

186
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:15,559
How you always run to somebody new.

187
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,459
Had me brokenhearted.

188
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,859
But I realized you were no good.

189
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:21,859
Now I'm gonna fight to laugh about it.

190
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:25,459
I'm so glad that we are through.

191
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:27,059
And I get deja vu.

192
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:49,559
I got deja vu.

193
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:06,059
High Tide

194
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:06,059
Lyrics, Music, Arrangement: ZSunder

195
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:13,059
When you look up at the night sky, what do you see?

196
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:18,459
The glowing beauty in the twilight's a mystery.

197
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:22,059
No words are said as it lights it all up.

198
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:25,459
When the time has come I'll be rising high.

199
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:30,059
Drowning for me like a lifeline. Whenever you see my show.

200
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:41,059
Head's follow just high.

201
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,259
It's pulling you in like gravity.

202
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:47,459
You will be bowing on your knees, yeah.

203
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:50,259
Pulling you in close to me.

204
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:53,459
Watch my glory and my...

205
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:57,259
Following me like a high tide. My reign will never stop.

206
00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:00,659
The tide begins to rise to the top.

207
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:05,059
Let my power ignite. Following me like a high tide.

208
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:18,359
I can be a bright enigma. It's no surprise.

209
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:24,059
That you'll give in to the brilliance. Like a moth to a light.

210
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:27,359
Playing hard to get but I'm patient.

211
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,459
Yes, you'll come to my radiant, yeah.

212
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:36,059
When you look up at the night sky, what do you see? My show.

213
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:46,459
Head's follow just high.

214
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,059
It's pulling you in like gravity.

215
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:52,359
You will be bowing on your knees, yeah.

216
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:55,059
Pulling you in close to me.

217
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:58,359
Watch my glory and my...

218
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:02,059
Following me like a high tide. My reign will never stop.

219
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:05,459
The tide begins to rise to the top.

220
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:09,459
Let my power ignite. Following me like a high tide.

221
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:20,859
Following me like a high tide.

222
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:27,559
I'll shine the brightest in the night.

223
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:34,059
The way the waves come night.

224
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,459
Okay guys, that's High Tide.

225
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:40,259
And after this we continue to Perisai Jitu.

226
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:42,559
If you guys know this song, please sing it with me.

227
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,059
Thank you!

228
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:49,059
Perisai Jitu

229
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:49,059
Lyrics: Donne Maula / Music, Arrangement: Ari Renaldi

230
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:47,559
Wajah cerah yang terlihat
A bright face that's seen

231
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,359
Diriku mahir sembunyi rasa
I'm skilled at hiding feelings

232
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,559
Sebenarnya hitam pekat
Actually it's pitch black

233
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,559
Kutup rapat jadi rahasia
I keep it tight, it becomes a secret

234
00:20:02,882 --> 00:20:04,982
Satu dua kali
Once or twice

235
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:06,982
Kun tak apa-apa
I'm okay

236
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:11,582
Kamu pikir hidupku baik-baik saja
You think my life is just fine

237
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:14,182
Siapa yang peduli
Who cares

238
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:16,782
Kupunya air mata
I have tears

239
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:21,782
Kamu hanya minta diri berikan tawa
You only ask me to give a laugh

240
00:20:22,782 --> 00:20:27,282
Ha ha ha...

241
00:20:28,582 --> 00:20:31,282
Wajah yang ku perisai jitu
The face I use as a perfect shield

242
00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:36,782
Ha ha ha...

243
00:20:37,782 --> 00:20:40,982
Tapi sampai kapan ku begitu
But how long will I be like that?

244
00:20:43,982 --> 00:20:46,982
Malam hari berwahana
Roaming at night

245
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:52,282
Pikiran liar ku juaranya
My wild thoughts are the champions

246
00:20:53,582 --> 00:20:56,982
Bukan ku tak berusaha
It's not that I'm not trying

247
00:20:57,582 --> 00:21:00,982
Ingin ku lepas sekuat tenaga
I want to let go with all my might

248
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:03,582
Satu dua kali
Once or twice

249
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:05,782
Kun tak apa-apa
I'm okay

250
00:21:05,982 --> 00:21:10,582
Kamu pikir hidupku baik-baik saja
You think my life is just fine

251
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:12,982
Siapa yang peduli
Who cares

252
00:21:13,282 --> 00:21:15,582
Kupunya air mata
I have tears

253
00:21:15,982 --> 00:21:20,282
Kamu hanya minta diri berikan tawa
You only ask me to give a laugh

254
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:26,282
Ha ha ha...

255
00:21:27,282 --> 00:21:30,282
Wajah yang ku perisai jitu
The face I use as a perfect shield

256
00:21:30,982 --> 00:21:35,782
Ha ha ha...

257
00:21:36,782 --> 00:21:40,282
Tapi sampai kapan ku begitu
But how long will I be like that?

258
00:21:45,282 --> 00:21:47,582
All right, you guys ready for the next?

259
00:21:47,782 --> 00:21:48,382
Yes.

260
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:50,082
Taut Hati, let's go!

261
00:21:50,582 --> 00:21:53,982
Tak perlu selalu bicara
No need to always talk

262
00:21:54,282 --> 00:21:57,582
Tapi kau pasti yang ku percaya
But you're definitely the one I trust

263
00:21:57,982 --> 00:22:01,582
Tempat berbagi cerita
A place to share stories

264
00:22:01,982 --> 00:22:05,582
Tangis pilu tawa gembira
Grieving tears and joyful laughs

265
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:09,582
Tak jumpa bagaimana kita
No matter how we meet

266
00:22:09,982 --> 00:22:13,582
Saling mengerti tanpa ada kata-kata
Understanding each other without words

267
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:21,282
Kita bisa selalu saling menjaga
We can always look out for each other

268
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:26,282
Tak paksa sayap ku jauh
Don't force my wings to fly far

269
00:22:26,582 --> 00:22:29,982
Tanpa takut ku kan terjatuh
Without fear that I will fall

270
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:33,982
Jika lelah aku tahu
If I'm tired, I know

271
00:22:34,282 --> 00:22:37,982
Dirimu tempat ku berteduh
You're the place where I take shelter

272
00:22:38,582 --> 00:22:41,982
Senangmu bahagiaku
Your joy is my happiness

273
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:45,982
Kesalmu pasti lah sedihku
Your annoyance is surely my sadness

274
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:49,982
Walau kita jarang temu
Even if we rarely meet

275
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:53,782
Kita selalu bisa saling bertumpu
We can always rely on each other

276
00:22:57,282 --> 00:23:00,582
Ru ru ru...

277
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:04,282
Bisa saling bertumpu
Can rely on each other

278
00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:33,982
My body and soul...

279
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,582
この手で make you mine
With these hands, I'll make you mine

280
00:23:39,982 --> 00:23:44,582
Wow wow wow...

281
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:48,082
(Yeah) Wow wow wow...

282
00:23:48,182 --> 00:23:50,382
Oh baby, I need you, I need you ずっと...
Oh baby, I need you, I need you forever...

283
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:55,282
君を見るたび 上書きされてゆく欲望に
Every time I see you, desire rewrites

284
00:23:55,582 --> 00:23:57,982
重なる eyes, eyes, eyes 胸を突く smile, smile, smile
Overlapping eyes, eyes, eyes... your smile, smile, smile strikes my heart

285
00:23:58,282 --> 00:24:02,982
ねえ その姿かたち 全てが拍車かけてく
Hey, that figure, that shape... everything's driving me wild

286
00:24:05,282 --> 00:24:08,582
恋から愛、愛、愛 毎秒可笑しくなってく
From a crush into love, love, love... every second, I'm losing my mind

287
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,282
手を伸ばせばもう 届く距離
If I reach out, it's close enough

288
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:15,782
危険な A to Z 試したい
A dangerous A to Z, let's try it out

289
00:24:16,282 --> 00:24:21,282
穏やかに恋したい どんなシーンも私に見せて
I wanna love you gently... show me any scene, let me see it all

290
00:24:21,782 --> 00:24:24,582
このまま stay by my side
Stay by my side, just like this

291
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:26,282
どこにも行かないで
Don't go anywhere

292
00:24:26,782 --> 00:24:30,782
100% 純粋な愛だから
100% pure love, that's for sure

293
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:32,782
ねえ いいでしょ?
Come on, isn't it okay?

294
00:24:32,982 --> 00:24:34,782
止められない感情
These feelings, I can't hold back

295
00:24:34,982 --> 00:24:37,282
その腕で抱きしめてよ
Wrap me up tight in your arms

296
00:24:37,582 --> 00:24:39,982
もう 遠ざけななや
No more distance, no way

297
00:24:40,282 --> 00:24:42,582
ずっと もっと近くで
I need you closer, every day

298
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:45,282
認め合いたい
Let's be real, no more lies

299
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:48,082
暴れ狂う衝動 持て余す駆け引きさ
Wild emotions running free... If I can't control it, it's too much for me

300
00:24:48,382 --> 00:24:50,082
Hey, me! What's wrong with me?

301
00:24:50,182 --> 00:24:50,882
Say!

302
00:24:50,982 --> 00:24:52,582
何も問題ない 普段通り
Nothing's wrong, just me being me

303
00:24:52,682 --> 00:24:53,582
My name!

304
00:24:53,682 --> 00:24:55,782
君の全部知りたい
I wanna know all about you

305
00:24:55,982 --> 00:25:00,782
I do need you, 今すぐ
I do need you, right now

306
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:04,282
最初は声を聞く それだけで良かった
At first, just hearing your voice was enough

307
00:25:06,408 --> 00:25:10,608
ふと気づいた なぜ わがままになったんだ
But then, slowly, "Why?" I became selfish

308
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:13,508
誰かに微笑みかけ
When you smile at someone else

309
00:25:13,508 --> 00:25:15,608
その誰かに苛立ち 隠せない
It frustrates me, I can't hide it

310
00:25:15,608 --> 00:25:16,608
自分に気づいた
I realized it was me.

311
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:18,608
独り占めしたい
I wanna keep you all to myself

312
00:25:18,608 --> 00:25:21,608
いっそ鎖に繋いで
Maybe I should chain you up

313
00:25:21,908 --> 00:25:24,608
二人きりの部屋 至近距離
in a room just for us, so close

314
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:27,108
言動 発言 監視したい
I wanna watch everything you do and say

315
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,608
頬寄せて眠りたい
I wanna sleep with my cheek next to yours

316
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:32,608
そっと吐息感じさせて
Let me feel your breath on me

317
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:34,608
永遠に Stay by your side
Stay by your side, forevermore

318
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:37,108
どこにも行かせない
I won't let you go anywhere

319
00:25:37,108 --> 00:25:39,608
100% 私だけに依存して
100% depend on me, that's all

320
00:25:39,608 --> 00:25:42,608
ねぇいいでしょ
Come on, isn't it okay?

321
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,108
縺れ詰まる愛憎
Love and hate turning black

322
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:47,108
丸ごと受け止めてよ
Take it all in, don't hold back

323
00:25:47,108 --> 00:25:48,108
(Boy, I wanna touch your love)

324
00:25:48,108 --> 00:25:50,308
私おかしいかな
Is something wrong with me?

325
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:53,108
だとしても引き返せない
Even if it is, there's no turning back

326
00:25:53,108 --> 00:25:55,108
昂ぶる衝動
Wild emotions running free

327
00:25:55,108 --> 00:25:58,608
歯止め効かない絶対
No stopping me, no way

328
00:25:59,108 --> 00:26:00,908
Hey, me! What's wrong with me?

329
00:26:00,908 --> 00:26:03,108
何も問題ない フツーだし
Nothing's wrong, just me being me

330
00:26:03,108 --> 00:26:04,608
(my name)

331
00:26:04,608 --> 00:26:06,608

I do need you, 今すぐ
I do need you, right now

333
00:26:10,108 --> 00:26:14,608
目を閉じたなら 止められない愛が
When I close my eyes, it's endless

334
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:17,608
触れたいんだ
I want to experience love, my way

335
00:26:18,108 --> 00:26:19,608
Boy, you

336
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:23,608
私の... 私だけ...
Mine... all mine...

337
00:26:24,108 --> 00:26:27,108
このまま Stay by my side
Stay by my side, just like this

338
00:26:27,108 --> 00:26:29,108
二度と離れないで
"Don't ever leave me"

339
00:26:29,608 --> 00:26:32,108
100% 純粋な愛だから
100% pure love, that's for sure

340
00:26:32,108 --> 00:26:34,608
ねぇいいでしょ
Come on, isn't it okay?

341
00:26:35,108 --> 00:26:37,108
この感情 抑えられない
These feelings, I can't hold back

342
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:39,608
腕の中で抱きしめてよ
Wrap me up tight in your arms

343
00:26:39,608 --> 00:26:40,608
(Boy, I wanna touch your love)

344
00:26:40,608 --> 00:26:42,608
もう遠ざけない
No more distance, no way

345
00:26:42,608 --> 00:26:45,608
ずっともっと近くで 求め合いたい
I need you closer, every day

346
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:48,108
昂ぶる衝動
Wild emotions running free

347
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,608
持て余すくらいさ
If I can't control it, it's too much for me

348
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:52,908
Hey, me! What's wrong with me?

349
00:26:52,908 --> 00:26:55,108

Nothing's wrong, just me being me

350
00:26:55,108 --> 00:26:56,608

I do need you, 今すぐ
I do need you, right now

353
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:05,108
Wow wow wow

354
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:09,108
Wow wow wow

355
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:11,608
Oh baby, I need you, I need you forever...

356
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:17,108
Wow wow wow

357
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:22,108
Oh baby, I need you, I need you forever...

358
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:36,108
Whoa! Nerissa!

359
00:27:37,108 --> 00:27:41,608
Finally our duet together song came true!
Finally our duet together came true!

360
00:27:42,108 --> 00:27:43,608
I know!

361
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:45,108
Thank you so much!

362
00:27:45,108 --> 00:27:49,108
I can't believe that I get to sing with you, the Moona Hoshinova!

363
00:27:49,108 --> 00:27:51,608
It's such a dream come true!

364
00:27:52,108 --> 00:27:54,108
Oh my God, me too!

365
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:56,608
So, this song...

366
00:27:56,608 --> 00:28:03,608
is actually about two girls who falling in love with one person and wanted to become their lover.

367
00:28:03,608 --> 00:28:06,608
Um, this song's actually not talking about a good romance, everyone.

368
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:13,608
So it's more like some... another toxic relationship who want to be loved...

369
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,608
100%, right Nerissa?

370
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:17,608
Right!

371
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:22,608
Uh, you know, we all probably have some experiences with toxic love.

372
00:28:23,108 --> 00:28:25,108
But, Moona, I have to tell you,

373
00:28:25,108 --> 00:28:29,108
when I was recording this, I was actually thinking about you.

374
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,608
Hehe.

375
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:34,108
Oh! You love me 100%?

376
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:37,108
Mm-hmm, I do, 100%!

377
00:28:38,108 --> 00:28:39,108
Nice.

378
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:44,608
Anyway, thank you so much Nerissa for accepting my offer to do it with me.

379
00:28:44,608 --> 00:28:48,108
Oh my God, I love your voice so much!

380
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:50,108
Thank you!

381
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:53,108
Ah, that means so much to me because I love your voice so much!

382
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:57,108
Thank you for inviting me, and also, Happy Birthday!

383
00:28:57,108 --> 00:29:02,108
I hope this next year of your life is even better than the last!

384
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,608
Aw, thank you!

385
00:29:05,608 --> 00:29:08,108
And also, thank you everyone!

386
00:29:08,608 --> 00:29:14,108
All right, after this, there will be another member to join to sing with me.

387
00:29:14,608 --> 00:29:16,108
So, are you guys ready?

388
00:29:16,108 --> 00:29:19,108
Now let's move to the next song!

389
00:29:19,608 --> 00:29:20,608
Yeah!

390
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:21,608

月明かり 闇を睨む今宵も
The moonlight glares at the darkness again tonight

394
00:30:03,108 --> 00:30:05,991
Cos' I'm waiting 溶け
Cos' I'm waiting melting

395
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:08,481
日の光降る朝
The morning when the sunlight falls

396
00:30:08,481 --> 00:30:09,731
期待みたいね
It's like anticipation, isn't it?

397
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:11,631
重い扉の奥で
Behind the heavy doors

398
00:30:11,631 --> 00:30:14,931
さあ その時を待ってる
Come, I'm waiting for that moment

399
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,931
いつまでも繋がる
Connected forever

400
00:30:17,931 --> 00:30:21,681
永遠なんてない 誰が決めた？
Who decided there's no such thing as eternity?

401
00:30:21,931 --> 00:30:26,931
時も命も 飛び越え
Leaping over both time and life

402
00:30:27,181 --> 00:30:28,631
信じよう
Let's believe

403
00:30:28,881 --> 00:30:32,731
Maze Town Maze Town 逃れられないわ
Maze Town, Maze Town, you can't escape

404
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:36,181
迷い続ける 幾多の魂
Many souls continue to wander

405
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:39,931
何千もの雨風 乗り越えて
Overcoming thousands of rain and wind

406
00:30:39,931 --> 00:30:42,881
守ってきた
I have protected it

407
00:30:43,081 --> 00:30:46,631

そこにいるのは 誰？ 誰？ 誰？
Who is there? Who? Who?

412
00:31:16,881 --> 00:31:20,481
鏡越し 不気味な音で Let you know
Through the mirror, with an eerie sound, let you know

413
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:23,681
この場所へ 私たちの棲み処
To this place, our dwelling

414
00:31:23,931 --> 00:31:27,531
ないはずの 黒い影うごめけ
Black shadows that shouldn't exist, wriggle

415
00:31:27,531 --> 00:31:31,181
不気味なシルエット
An eerie silhouette

416
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:34,181
確かにあるもの
Something that certainly exists

417

守っていくから
I will go on protecting them

423
00:31:59,781 --> 00:32:03,481
Maze Town 明けない夜を飛び越えて
Maze Town, leaping over the night that never ends

424
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:06,981
今蘇る 彷徨う魂
Wandering souls now come back to life

425
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:10,381
境界線 曖昧に溶け出してく
The boundaries are starting to blur and melt

426
00:32:10,581 --> 00:32:13,681

Place your ear to your heart

427

永遠に 踊り続けましょう
Let's keep dancing forever

430
00:32:31,681 --> 00:32:35,181

Overcoming the spinning, revolving time

431
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:38,581

00:34:33,331 --> 00:34:39,681
味気ないだけの ドラマと違う 私は毒気
Different from a boring drama, I am poisonous

450
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:46,181
まるで運命の糸を 結びつける
It's as if I'm tying the thread of fate

451
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:52,681
お遊び 大胆に抱きしめてあげる ほら虜
Just for play, I'll hold you boldly, look, you're captivated

452
00:34:53,181 --> 00:34:59,481
奪っちゃった 心ごと 恨み言を どうぞさあ どうぞ どうぞ
I've stolen your heart, go ahead with your grudges, please, come on

ねぇあなたの逃げ場は私 魅惑が引き寄せる
Hey, I am your refuge, my charm draws you in.

455
00:35:09,955 --> 00:35:13,255
あの世にあなたの居場所はない ならばしょうがない
In the next world, you have no place, so it can't be helped.

456
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:16,955
朽ちるまで光りましょう
Let's shine until we decay,

457
00:35:16,955 --> 00:35:20,355

はじめましてのキスをしましょう
Let's have a first-time kiss.

459
00:35:41,155 --> 00:35:47,355
何も考えないで 毒々舞う 私の路地
Don't think about anything, poisonously dancing in my alley.

460
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:53,855
まるで運命の糸を結びつける
It's as if I'm tying the thread of fate.

461
00:35:54,155 --> 00:36:00,555
お遊び 簡単に騙されて お利口 ほら虜
Just playing around, easily deceived, such a good boy, see, you're a captive.

ねぇあなたの逃げ場は私 魅惑が引き寄せる

00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:32,655
あなたの居場所は私
I am your place to be.

467
00:36:33,155 --> 00:36:37,355
あの子にあなたへの愛はない ならばしょうがない
That girl has no love for you, so it can't be helped.

468
00:36:39,455 --> 00:36:43,455
私たち契りましょう 明かしましょう
Let's make a vow, let's reveal it.
