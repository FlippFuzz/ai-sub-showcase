足りないとこばっかだけど
I'm full of shortcomings, though.

31
00:06:53,148 --> 00:06:55,648
ポンコツでドジなあたしだったら
If it's clumsy and klutzy old me,

32
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:57,948
きみはだめだよね？
you wouldn't like that, right?

33
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:00,648
でも　やだやだミスってらんない
But no, no, I can't afford to mess up.

34
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:03,248
やだやだ踊ってベイピーダンス
No, no, dance the Baby Dance.

35
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,148
あたしはまだ諦めない
I'm not giving up yet.

36
00:07:06,648 --> 00:07:09,148
でもでも全然だめかも
But, but, it might be totally hopeless.

37
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:11,948
だってベイピーダンス　上手くできないの
'Cause the Baby Dance, I can't do it well.

38
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:14,648
だってベイピーダンス　伝えられないの
'Cause the Baby Dance, I can't convey it.

39

もっと可愛くなりたいのに
I want to be even cuter,

40
00:07:18,148 --> 00:07:20,548

41
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:23,548
やだやだミスってらんないね？

見せたくないとこ透けちゃって
The parts I don't want to show show through.

45
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,248
無理無理　でも期待をしたいな
No way, no way. But I want to have hope.

46
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:41,948
いいですか？
Is that okay?

47
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:44,748
ポンコツもドジも全部あたしなんだよ
Being clumsy and a klutz, it's all part of me.

48
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:47,348
ちゃんと見ていてほしい
I want you to look at me properly.

49
00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:49,848
ねえ、もう　やだやだくずって後悔
Hey, geez. No, no, crumbling and regretting.

50
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:52,448
やだやだ回ってベイピーダンス
No, no, spin around, Baby Dance.

51
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:55,348
だめなあたし塗り替えたい
I want to repaint the 'no-good' me.

52
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:58,348
でもでも全然だめかも
But, but, it might be totally hopeless.

53
00:07:58,748 --> 00:08:01,148
だってベイピーダンス　上手くできないの
'Cause the Baby Dance, I can't do it well.

54
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,848
だってベイピーダンス　伝えられないの
'Cause the Baby Dance, I can't convey it.

55
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:06,848
もっと可愛くなりたいのに
I want to be even cuter,

56
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:09,848
どうしたらいいとかわかんないし
but I don't know what I should do.

57
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:13,048
まだ　まだ　いけるかな
I wonder if I can still, still do it.

58
00:08:13,548 --> 00:08:16,148
まだ　まだ　言えるかな
I wonder if I can still, still say it.

59
00:08:16,648 --> 00:08:19,148
まだ　まだ　できるかな
I wonder if I can still, still make it happen.

60
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:22,048
まだ　まだ　うぅ
Still, still, ugh...

61
00:08:22,748 --> 00:08:25,248
ポンコツでドジでだめで足りないとこばっかだって
Even if I'm clumsy, a klutz, no good, and full of shortcomings...

62
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,748
きっとやめないんだ
I surely won't stop.

63
00:08:28,148 --> 00:08:30,648
ポンコツでドジでだめで足りないとこばっかって
Being clumsy, a klutz, no good, and full of shortcomings...

64
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:33,448
見ていてほしい
I want you to watch me.

65
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:34,948
Uh yeah~

66
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,548
ねえ！
Hey!

67
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:39,048

68
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:41,648
やだやだ踊ってベイピーダンス
No, no, dance the Baby Dance.

69
00:08:41,848 --> 00:08:44,348
あたしはまだ諦めない
I'm not giving up yet.

70
00:08:44,848 --> 00:08:47,348
ほらほら全然だめじゃない
Look, look, it's not totally hopeless.

71
00:08:47,748 --> 00:08:50,248
だってベイピーダンス　上手くできるから
'Cause the Baby Dance, I can do it well.

72
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,948
だってベイピーダンス　伝えられるから
'Cause the Baby Dance, I can convey it.

73
00:08:53,348 --> 00:08:55,848
もっと可愛くなりたいから
Because I want to be even cuter,

どんな時だってそう頑張れるし
I can try my best no matter when.

75
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:01,848
だってベイピーダンス　きみに届くまで
'Cause the Baby Dance, until it reaches you.

76
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:04,648
だってベイピーダンス　きみに会えるまで
'Cause the Baby Dance, until I can meet you.

77
00:09:05,148 --> 00:09:07,548
もっと可愛くなりたいから
Because I want to be even cuter,

78
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,548

あの人たちねねたちのこと見てな〜い？
Aren't those people looking at us?

95
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:35,463
いや、ねねのことだけ見てるかも〜
No, maybe they're only looking at Nene~

109
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:34,663
LINEも未読スルー＝するんだ
I'll even leave your LINE on 'unread'

110
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:39,063
「最近なんか気になって仕方ないんだよなー…」
"Lately I've been so interested in them, I can't help it..."

111
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:42,563
そんな感じで毎晩ずっと
Like that every night, all the time

112
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:45,063
何度も何度もきっと
Surely over and over

113
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,663
SNSしちゃうチェックでしょ？
You'll be checking my SNS, right?

114
00:11:47,963 --> 00:11:50,063
ほら！もっと夢中になって！
Look! Get even more obsessed!

115
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:52,663
わざとあげた このストーリー
I posted this story on purpose

116
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:55,363
君の足跡チェックするの
Checking your footprint

117
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:57,863
あざといなんて言わないで
Don't say I'm calculated

118
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:00,363
だって Love you, Love you, Love you 好きだっちゃ！
Because Love you, Love you, Love you, I love you!

119
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:02,863
わざと遅い 既読通知
The read notification is late on purpose

120
00:12:02,963 --> 00:12:05,163
私の心 非公開
My heart is 'private'

121
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:07,863
鍵をかけた 恋心
Locked away love

122
00:12:08,263 --> 00:12:11,463
ねえ ほら ほら ほら
Hey, look, look, look

123
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:13,663
私を気にして もっともっと
Notice me more and more

124
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:28,463
私の声で 君が笑うから
Because you laugh at my voice

125
00:12:29,263 --> 00:12:31,363
その瞬間も切り取って
I want to cut out that moment

126
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:33,863
即保存しちゃいたい
And save it immediately

127
00:12:34,063 --> 00:12:36,663
そのために心奪っちゃいます
For that, I'll steal your heart

128
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:39,363
明日は君の誕生日
Tomorrow is your birthday

129
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:42,363
5分 4分 3分 2分
5 min, 4 min, 3 min, 2 min

130
00:12:42,463 --> 00:12:44,863
「おめでとう！」わざと早まって
"Happy Birthday!" I said it early on purpose

131
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:49,063
「ごめん、誰より早く伝えたかったんだ」
"Sorry, I wanted to tell you before anyone else"

132
00:12:49,863 --> 00:12:52,363
そんなこと言えばあっという間
If you say something like that, it's over in a flash

133
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:54,863
チョコレートみたい
Like chocolate

134
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:57,463
溶けちゃうね
It'll melt away

135
00:12:57,863 --> 00:13:00,063
もう！早く振り向いて！
Jeez! Look at me already!

136
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:02,863
わざとあざと エキスパート
Calculated, Cute Expert

137
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:05,363
私の心 のぞいてよ
Take a peek into my heart

138
00:13:05,463 --> 00:13:07,863
タイムラインは 君ばっか
My timeline is full of you

139
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:10,663
もっと Love you, Love you, Love you
More Love you, Love you, Love you

140
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:11,363
ドキドキキュンキュン！
Heart thumping!

141
00:13:11,463 --> 00:13:13,863
君だけに 限定公開
Open only to you

142
00:13:13,963 --> 00:13:15,363
足跡つくの 待ってるのに
Even though I'm waiting for your footprint

143
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:17,863
このままいけば ログアウト
If it goes on like this, I'll log out

144
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,663
そんなのやだ やだ やだ 私を愛して
I hate that, hate that, hate that, love me

145
00:13:21,063 --> 00:13:23,663
ずっとずっと
Forever and ever

146
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:38,463
そっと見れた 君のアカウントも
Even your account that I took a peek at

147
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:43,663
やっぱ君も 私を好きなんだね
I knew it, you like me too

148
00:13:44,263 --> 00:13:46,663
わざとは全部君の
Because all the "purposely"

149
00:13:46,763 --> 00:13:49,063
ためなんだから
was for you

150
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:54,463
落ちちゃえばいいんだ
You should just fall for me

151
00:13:57,463 --> 00:14:00,063
だけど私少し反省
But I'm reflecting a little

152
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:02,363
あまり試すの良くないね
It's not good to test you too much

153
00:14:02,463 --> 00:14:04,863
やけに遅い 既読通知…
The read notification is awfully late...

154
00:14:05,063 --> 00:14:07,463
やっぱ気になる！なる！
I knew it, I'm curious! Curious!

155
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:10,063
わざとあげた このストーリー
I posted this story on purpose

156
00:14:10,163 --> 00:14:12,663
君の足跡チェックするの
Checking your footprint

157
00:14:12,863 --> 00:14:15,363
あざといなんて 言わないで
Don't say I'm calculated

158
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:17,863
だって Love you, Love you, Love you 好きだっちゃ！
Because Love you, Love you, Love you, I love you!

159
00:14:18,163 --> 00:14:20,563
わざと遅い 既読通知
The read notification is late on purpose

160
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:22,863
私の心 非公開
My heart is 'private'

161
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,863
鍵をかけた 恋心
Locked away love

162
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:29,363
ねえ ほら ほら ほら
Hey, look, look, look

163
00:14:29,463 --> 00:14:30,863
私を気にして もっともっと
Notice me more and more

164
00:14:31,063 --> 00:14:34,063
まさか君も わざとなの？
Could it be that you're doing it on purpose too?

165
00:14:34,563 --> 00:14:37,363
みこち！お誕生日おめでとう！
Mikochi! Happy Birthday!

166
00:14:37,463 --> 00:14:39,263
ねねちありがとう〜！
Nenechi, thank you~!

167
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:41,363
ライブ誘ってくれてありがとうね！
Thanks for inviting me to the live!

168
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,463
嬉しいよ！
I'm happy!

169
00:14:42,563 --> 00:14:45,063
ううん、またママトクやろうね！
No problem, let's do Mamazoku again!

170
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,663
ちょっとちょっとみこ先輩！
Wait wait, Miko-senpai!

171
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:01,378
ちょっとちょっとみこ先輩！
Wait, wait, Miko-senpai!

172
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:03,778
この祝い酒だぁ〜ってお酒飲みすぎなんですけどぉ！
You're drinking too much "celebratory sake"!

173
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,878
え〜そんなにみこの生誕祭が嬉しいのかなぁ〜？
Heh~ are you that happy about Miko's birthday?

174
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:11,878
あっ、めちゃくちゃ首振ってますよぉ！
Ah, she's shaking her head so much!

175
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,778
こら、ツンデレかぁ〜？
Hey, are you a tsundere?

176
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:18,578
こういうときは素直にならんかいっ
You should be honest at times like this!

177
00:15:19,478 --> 00:15:22,578
そうだそうだぁ〜、ラミィたんいいこというなぁ〜！
Right, right~ Lamy-tan, you're saying good things!

178
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:24,778
おい、あれぇ〜？
Hey, huh?

179
00:15:25,178 --> 00:15:27,778
ん？ちょっと！きいてんのかあ？
Hmm? Hey! Are you listening?

180
00:15:35,178 --> 00:15:38,078
おねだりしてみてほしいの
I want you to try begging

181
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,578
ダーリン あなたは私の言うこと全然聞かない
Darling, you don't listen to me at all

182
00:15:56,578 --> 00:15:59,278
あれほどやめてって言ったタバコもお酒も
The cigarettes and alcohol I told you to stop,

183
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:01,878
毎日二箱七合欠かさず
you still have two packs and seven go daily without fail.

184
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,578
肝臓やられてお釈迦になっても看病してあげないんだから
Even if your liver gives out and you pass away, I won't nurse you.

185
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:07,478
言いたいことは言わないし
You don't say what you want to say

186
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:09,878
行きたいとこからやりたいことまで
From where you want to go to what you want to do

187
00:16:09,878 --> 00:16:12,378
決めてるくせしてだんまりさん
Even though you've decided, you're staying silent

188
00:16:12,378 --> 00:16:14,578
ねえ そんなの馬鹿みたいじゃない？
Hey, isn't that just stupid?

189
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:15,478
そうじゃない？じゃない？じゃない？
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?

190
00:16:15,478 --> 00:16:17,878
いつも思わせぶりな感じで
Always acting like you're hinting at something

191
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:20,378
察してほしい感じで
Acting like you want me to guess

192
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:24,478
わざと口にしないの ずるくない？
Isn't it unfair that you purposely don't say it?

193
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:26,178
馬鹿じゃないの？
Aren't you stupid?

194
00:16:26,178 --> 00:16:28,478
お願いダーリン 見て聞いて
Please, Darling, look and listen

195
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:31,078
欲しいのは形のないもの
What I want is something without a form

196
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:33,878
馬鹿にしないで 見て聞いて
Don't make fun of me, look and listen

197
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:36,478
覗いてよ瞳の奥の方
Peer into the depths of my eyes

198
00:16:36,678 --> 00:16:38,978
まっすぐ見つめて
Stare straight at me

199
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:42,278
おねだりしてみてほしいの？
Do you want me to try begging?

200
00:16:48,378 --> 00:16:50,978
ダーリン 私はあなたの気持ちを全然知らないわ
Darling, I don't know your feelings at all

201
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:53,678
あれほど健気に見つめてきたのに今ではすっかり知らんぷり
Even though I've gazed at you so devotedly, now you ignore me.

202
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:56,578
ていうかそれって胡坐かいてるだけなんじゃないんですかぶっちゃけ
To be honest, aren't you just being complacent?

203
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:59,278
舌先三寸あなたのおかげで私のハートはボロボロです
Thanks to your glib tongue, my heart is in tatters.

204
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:02,178
つれない時はつれないし
When you're cold, you're cold

205
00:17:02,178 --> 00:17:04,578
そっちが中々言い出さないから
Since you won't say anything

206
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:07,178
いつも私が舵取りじゃん？
I'm always the one taking the lead, right?

207
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:09,178
ねえ なんだか馬鹿みたいじゃない？
Hey, isn't it kind of stupid?

208
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:11,878
そうじゃない？じゃない？じゃない？
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?

209
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:14,378
どこか足元見てる感じで
Acting like you're looking down on me somewhere

210
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:16,878
値踏みされてる感じで
Acting like you're appraising me

211
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:21,078
駆け引きやら勝ち負けじゃなくない？
Isn't it not about tactics or winning and losing?

212
00:17:21,678 --> 00:17:22,778
馬鹿じゃないの？
Aren't you stupid?

213
00:17:22,778 --> 00:17:24,978
寡黙なダーリン 寝てないで
Silent Darling, don't sleep

214
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:27,578
切なさは飾りじゃないのよ
Pain isn't just a decoration

215
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:29,978
よそ見しないで 逃げないで
Don't look away, don't run away

216
00:17:29,978 --> 00:17:32,478
触ってよ心の奥の方
Touch the depths of my heart

217
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,078
一瞬のことじゃない
It's not just for a moment

218
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:38,278
おねだりしてはくれないの？
Won't you beg for me?

219
00:17:48,378 --> 00:17:50,678
言葉に出来ない臆病さは
The cowardice that can't be put into words

220
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:53,078
裸足で逃げたいのよ
I want to run away barefoot

221
00:17:54,378 --> 00:17:56,878
甘えないでよ 口に出してよ
Don't be spoiled, say it out loud

222
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,678
もう ちゃんとこっち向いてったら
Geez, just turn this way properly

223
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:03,078
お願いダーリン 見て聞いて
Please, Darling, look and listen

224
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:05,578
欲しいのは形のないもの
What I want is something without a form

225
00:18:06,078 --> 00:18:08,478
馬鹿にしないで 見て聞いて
Don't make fun of me, look and listen

226
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:10,978
覗いてよ瞳の奥の方
Peer into the depths of my eyes

227
00:18:11,178 --> 00:18:13,478
寡黙なダーリン 寝てないで
Silent Darling, don't sleep

228
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:15,978
暴いてよ私の素顔を
Expose my true face

229
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:19,178
お願いダーリン そばにいて
Please, Darling, stay by my side

230
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:21,778
触らせて心の奥の方
Let me touch the depths of my heart

231
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:24,478
まっすぐ見つめて
Stare straight at me

232
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,778
おねだりしてみてほしいの
I want you to try begging

233
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:45,978
おねがいダーリン
Please, Darling

234
00:18:46,578 --> 00:18:49,078
みこ先輩お誕生日おめでとー！
Miko-senpai, happy birthday!

235
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:51,078
ラミィたんありがとー！
Lamy-tan, thank you!

236
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:05,078
はぁ・・・誕生日なのに・・・
Sigh... even though it's my birthday...

237
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:11,878
どんなにみんなにお祝いされても結局部屋で一人なんだよなぁ。
No matter how much everyone celebrates, in the end, I'm alone in my room.

238
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:14,378
バーチャルって・・・。
Virtual life is...

239
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:15,578
あれ？
Huh?

240
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:17,578
かなたんからLINEだ
A LINE message from Kanatan

241
00:19:18,078 --> 00:19:20,578
みこてんぱい、なに寂しがってるんですか？
Miko-tenpai, why are you feeling lonely?

242
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:22,578
かなたそがいるじゃん！
Kanataso is here for you!

243
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,178
わかるよその気持ち、
I understand that feeling,

244
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:29,378
だから・・・かなたそがなんでも聞いてあげるよ・・・？
So... Kanataso will listen to anything you have to say...?

245
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:32,478
かなたん・・・！♡
Kanatan...! ♡

キショキショな現実を忘れさせてあげる慈愛の天使
The angel of benevolence who will make you forget this creepy reality

251
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,878
大人のみんなには内緒だぞ
It's a secret from all the adults

252
00:19:56,878 --> 00:19:58,378
大丈夫もう何も怖くないから
It's okay, because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore

253
00:19:58,378 --> 00:20:00,078
こんなSNS抜け出して二人で海を見に行くぞ！
Let's escape this SNS and go see the ocean together!

254
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:02,893
インターネットやめろ！
Stop the internet!

255
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:05,593

イェイ！
Yay!

00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:14,393
わかる真似をして
Pretending to understand

259
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:18,093
何も知らないね
You don't know anything

260
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:21,093
アナタ
You

261
00:20:24,093 --> 00:20:26,593
何が悲しいの
What is sad?

262
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:29,093
何が寂しいの
What is lonely?

263
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:32,493
聴こえてる？
Can you hear me?

264
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:36,593
人が恋しくて
Longing for people

265
00:20:37,093 --> 00:20:39,093
人がイヤすぎて
Hating people too much

266

ループ
Looping

267
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:46,593
夜が好き（なの）に
Even though I like the night

268
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:49,093
一人じゃ寒くて
It's cold being alone

269
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:53,093
震えてる
I'm shivering

270
00:20:54,693 --> 00:20:57,093
本当は幸せを知っているのに
Even though I actually know happiness

271
00:20:57,293 --> 00:20:59,093
不幸なフリ やめられないね
I can't stop pretending to be unhappy

272
00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:10,593
アンチに負けず
Not losing to antis

273
00:21:10,593 --> 00:21:11,393
信者に媚びず
Not pandering to believers

274
00:21:11,393 --> 00:21:12,893
どんなに努力を重ねても
No matter how much effort I put in

275
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:13,893
一寸先は地獄行き
One step ahead is a trip to hell

276
00:21:13,893 --> 00:21:14,793
いやもうすでに冥府魔道
No, it's already a demonic path to hell

277
00:21:14,793 --> 00:21:15,793
地獄の沙汰もいいね次第
Even hell's judgment depends on likes

278
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:17,393
決死のトラップ蜘蛛の糸
A life-risking trap, a spider's thread

279
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:18,893
こんなに苦しいはずなのに
Even though it's supposed to be this painful

280
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:21,093
インターネットがやめられない！
I can't stop the internet!

281
00:21:30,093 --> 00:21:32,393
駆け巡るエクスタシー
Ecstasy running through

282
00:21:32,393 --> 00:21:35,593
溶けるマイスリー
Melting Myslee

283
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:37,893
画面光りだすの
The screen starts to glow

284
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:41,093
不安止まらないよ
My anxiety won't stop
