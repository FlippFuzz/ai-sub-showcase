104
00:10:09,616 --> 00:10:12,716
全部大丈夫だと言えたら
If only I could say that all the bad things are fine,

105
00:10:12,716 --> 00:10:15,516
いいのにな
that would be nice.

106
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:19,416

If only I could think that way.

107
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,516
違う予定調和な大正解

114
00:10:37,316 --> 00:10:39,716
だとか本当は怯えてる
Or saying you're actually scared,

115
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:41,816
吠えるだけの弱虫だった

00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,540
言わせておけばいいさ
Just let them say whatever they want.

453
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,040
いつの日か 寝ても覚めても
Someday, awake or asleep,

454
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,540
夢見てた大歓声
that great applause I dreamed of...

455
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,040
私はここで死にたくない
I don't want to die here!

456
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,040
一緒の旅 逆境の世紀
A journey together in this century of adversity,

457
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,040
愛すら空回って
where even love spins in vain.

458
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,040
私の邪魔させやしない
I won't let anyone get in my way.

459
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,040
Like a Takane 見据えた神
Like a Takane, the god I gazed at.

460
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,540
穴蔵から空へ
From the burrow to the sky.

461
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,040
飛んでいく私を見ないなんて
How can you not watch me fly away?

462
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Bad boy

463
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Bad boy...

464
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,540
誰かに言われなくたって
Even if no one tells me,

465
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,540
私の方が もっと嫌いだ
I hate it more than anyone.

466
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,040
うるさいな
Shut up.

467
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,040
騒がしい視界を塞いで
Blocking the noisy view,

468
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,040
惨めな理由を書き連ねる
I list up miserable reasons.

469
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,040
教室にずっと居残り
Staying behind in the classroom forever,

470
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,540
窓の向こうに黒い影があって
there was a black shadow beyond the window,

471
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,040
何も言わずにこっちを見ていた
looking at me without saying a word.

472
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:05,040
私は貴方に救われたくて 泣くんじゃない
I'm not crying because I want to be saved by you.

473
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,040
産声は止められないもの
A first cry is something that cannot be stopped.

474
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,540
何千回ともう一度 死に損ないを
Thousands of times, and once more, surviving death,

475
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:21,540
希望と絶望の真ん中を纏って
wrapped in the middle of hope and despair.

476
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,540
醜い光を許したのは
The one who forgave the ugly light

477
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,040
他ならない私だった
was none other than myself.

478
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,040
息をして
Breathe.

479
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,040
目を開けて
Open your eyes.

480
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,040
これが最後かどうか
Whether this is the last time,

481
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,040
知る術はないよ
there's no way to know.

482
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,040
知りたくもないよ
I don't even want to know.

483
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,540
優しいな
It's so gentle...

484
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,540
コンコンと闇は寄り添って
Darkness snuggles up deeply,

485
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,040
解けない答えを塗り潰し
painting over the insoluble answer...

486
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,348
…もないよと
…there's nothing anymore.

487
00:30:04,098 --> 00:30:07,548
窓を挟んで微かに聞こえた
I heard it faintly across the window.

488
00:30:08,148 --> 00:30:12,448
それは祈るような啜り泣きだった
It was a sobbing sound like a prayer.

489
00:30:13,148 --> 00:30:17,548
私は貴方を救える言葉を知らないけど
I don't know the words to save you, but...

490
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:22,248
寂しいねって声をかけた
I called out, saying 'It's lonely, isn't it.'

491
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:45,148
何千回ともう一度 死に損ないを
Thousands of times and once more, the survivor.

492
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:51,548
希望と絶望の夜中を纏って
Clad in the midnight of hope and despair.

493
00:30:52,848 --> 00:30:56,548
何千回ともう一度 生きる貴方へ
Thousands of times and once more, to you who lives.

494
00:30:57,248 --> 00:31:01,348
私も続くよ 窓の向こう側で
I will follow too, on the other side of the window.

495
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:06,348
醜い光を愛してた時
When I loved the ugly light,

496
00:31:06,748 --> 00:31:11,748
終わらせなかった産声を
The first cry that I didn't let end...

497
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:16,448
歌にしよう
Let's make it a song.

498

賢くないゆえ出来なかった

これが君の結末ならば
If this is your ending,

651
00:41:47,364 --> 00:41:49,864
笑ってしまいたいほど
enough to make me want to laugh.

652
00:41:51,164 --> 00:41:53,364

後悔がうるさい夜だ
Regret makes for a noisy night.

過去は過去だと割り切っちゃえば
If you just write off the past as the past,

668
00:42:35,164 --> 00:42:37,364
きっといいことあるさとか
saying 'surely good things will happen',

669
00:42:37,364 --> 00:42:40,964
それくらい百も承知だ ラッタッタ
I'm fully aware of that much, rattatta.

670

願うことも
Wishing,

671

00:43:01,364 --> 00:43:03,364
やだ 痛い 痛い 痛い 痛いな
No, it hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts.

677
00:43:03,364 --> 00:43:05,564
悲劇のヒロイン気取っちゃって
Acting like a tragic heroine,

678
00:43:05,564 --> 00:43:07,564
もう嫌 嫌 嫌 嫌 嫌
I already hate, hate, hate, hate, hate it.

679
00:43:07,564 --> 00:43:09,664
諦めちゃえば
Why don't you just give up?

680
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:12,064

自己回答 こんがらがっちゃって
My self-answer is all tangled up.

682
00:43:14,064 --> 00:43:16,564
明日またきっと壊すけどいいの
I'll surely break it again tomorrow, but that's fine.

あの頃の二人のままで
just like the two of us back then.

689
00:43:36,564 --> 00:43:38,264
でも分かっているよ
But I understand,

690
00:43:39,964 --> 00:43:42,564
すぐに覚めてしまうと
that I will wake up soon.

691
00:43:43,064 --> 00:43:44,764
それならばいっそ
If that's the case, then rather,

692
00:43:45,364 --> 00:43:47,364
君の手でそっと
with your hand, gently,

693
00:43:47,364 --> 00:43:49,064
トドメ刺して
finish me off.

694
00:43:49,064 --> 00:43:52,564
ほら 今 今 今！

So,

722
00:44:54,364 --> 00:44:56,564
ルイ セカンドアルバム発売決定おめでとう！
Lui, congratulations on your 2nd album release!

723
00:44:57,664 --> 00:44:58,864
ありがとうー！
Thank you!

724
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:04,022
そう、いっぱい相談しました。
Right, I consulted with her a lot.

725
00:45:04,022 --> 00:45:09,252
いっぱいいっぱい確かに、ルル聞いたかも。なんか曲、結構知ってるかも。
I certainly heard a lot, Lulu. I might actually know the songs quite well.

726
00:45:09,252 --> 00:45:14,372
そう、いっぱいいっぱい相談しましたすいちゃんに。
Yes, I consulted Suichan a lot.

727
00:45:14,372 --> 00:45:18,572
このジグザグもね、実はちょっとリリース前から聴いてて。
Actually, I was listening to this "Zigzag" even before its release.

728
00:45:18,572 --> 00:45:26,772
今日はですね、ジグザグをすいちゃんと歌いたかった理由はですね、ま、本当にあの...
The reason I wanted to sing "Zigzag" with Suichan today is, well, really...

729
00:45:26,772 --> 00:45:32,472
いっぱいいっぱい相談をしたっていうのと...
...because I consulted with her so much, and...

730
00:45:32,472 --> 00:45:39,172
あと曲がね、あのタイトルを一緒にね、考えてくれたんですよね、ジグザグという。
...also, she helped me think of the song title together, "Zigzag".

731
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:43,772
一番最初タイトル本当は違ったんだよね。
At first, the title was actually different, wasn't it?

732
00:45:43,772 --> 00:45:49,072
そこからどうかなーつって、え、ジグザグってトラウマって意味あるらしいよみたいな。
We were wondering about it, like "Eh, apparently 'zigzag' has a meaning related to trauma."

733
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:54,472
なって、一緒にね、え、ジグザグ良くない？
And then, together, "Eh, isn't 'Zigzag' good?"

734
00:45:54,472 --> 00:45:58,272
ジグザグじゃない？みたいな、間にハイフンとか入れようぜみたいな。え、お洒落じゃない？みたいな。
"Isn't it 'Zigzag'? Let's put a hyphen in between." "Eh, isn't that stylish?"

735
00:45:58,272 --> 00:46:06,572
たくさんたくさん相談をしまして、でね、ジグザグすいちゃんに合いそうだなーみたいな。
I consulted a lot, and thought "Zigzag" would really suit Suichan.

736
00:46:06,572 --> 00:46:12,372
え、でもこれね、歌っててね、楽しいね。
Eh, but singing this, you know, it's fun.

737
00:46:12,372 --> 00:46:16,872
楽しいでしょ？これ楽しいですよすごい。楽しいんですよ是非皆さんも。
It's fun, isn't it? This is really fun. It's fun, everyone should try it.

738
00:46:16,872 --> 00:46:25,172
ルイとね、やっぱその声質というかね、このなんだろ、低音歌う組というか。
With Lui, like, the voice quality, or how should I put it, the low-tone singing group...

739
00:46:25,172 --> 00:46:29,872
として、なんか合ってるなっていうのもすごい思ったし、なんか歌ってて楽しかったです。
...as that, I really thought we matched well, and it was fun singing.

740
00:46:29,872 --> 00:46:38,272
いやもう、ジグザグ歌うんだったら、すいちゃんと歌いたいって言って。もう、絶対すいちゃんと歌うって言って。
No, I said if I'm singing "Zigzag", I want to sing with Suichan. I said I'll definitely sing with Suichan.

741
00:46:38,272 --> 00:46:43,972
あの、お呼びしたら快諾をしてくださいました。本当にありがとうございます。忙しい中でありがとうございまーす。
When I called her, she readily agreed. Thank you so much. Thank you amidst your busyness.

742
00:46:43,972 --> 00:46:50,972
いえいえ、そんなもうね、生出演なんかもういつでも呼んでください、そんなね。ありがとうございます。
No no, really, for a live appearance, call me anytime. Thank you.

00:46:56,572 --> 00:47:03,272
いやー本当に一緒に歌えて、ま、本当に緊張したんだけども、一緒に歌えて良かった。しかも2回目なんですよ、一緒に二人で歌ったの。
I'm really glad we could sing together, well, I was really nervous, but I'm glad. Moreover, it's the second time we've sung together.

745
00:47:03,272 --> 00:47:09,572
そうなんですよねー。前はMガデのファーストでね。バグ。
That's right. Before was at M-Garden's 1st live. "Bug".

746
00:47:09,572 --> 00:47:16,872
そう、バグで。今度はジグザグ。次は何になるんでしょうか。何グですか？何グになるんでしょうか。
Yes, with "Bug". This time "Zigzag". What will be next? What-gu is it? What-gu will it be?

747
00:47:16,872 --> 00:47:22,572
はい、どうぞね、今後も楽しみにしていただけたらなと思うんですけれども。
Yes, please look forward to the future.

748
00:47:22,572 --> 00:47:28,072
なんとまだ告知があるんです。えー、そんなまさか。
Actually, there is still an announcement. Eh, no way.

749
00:47:28,072 --> 00:47:35,372
なので... え、ちょっとこのアルバムに絡めたやつですよ。
So... eh, it's something related to this album.

750
00:47:35,372 --> 00:47:39,872
えー、何何？気になる気になるー。
Eh, what what? I'm curious, I'm curious.

751
00:47:39,872 --> 00:47:46,072

Curious? Then shall we watch together? Eh, we're watching it. Yes, let's watch together. So, please watch this. Go ahead.

752
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:54,572
さてさて、存じ上げな... え？わ？
Well then, I don't know... Eh? Wha?

753
00:47:57,072 --> 00:48:00,072
Who are you you you どちら様？
Who are you, you, you, who are you?

754
00:48:00,072 --> 00:48:03,072
Face to face こんにちは
Face to face, hello.

755
00:48:03,072 --> 00:48:07,072
You and me も乗ってだって Upside down for
You and me riding along, Upside down for...

756
00:48:07,072 --> 00:48:10,072
自分自分 Look a lie? Like a lie?
Myself, myself. Look a lie? Like a lie?

757
00:48:13,572 --> 00:48:18,072
構えて構えて構えは誰気な 自分は自分ので
Get ready, get ready, whose stance is that? I'll do it my way...

758
00:48:19,072 --> 00:48:21,072
片付けましょう
Let's clean this up.

759
00:48:22,072 --> 00:48:24,072
で、Foo Are you 誰？
So, Foo Are you, who?

760
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:40,072
なんと、セカンドアルバムより、『Foo Are!?』が本日24時に先行デジタルリリースがされますー！
Surprisingly, from the 2nd album, "Foo Are!?" will be digitally released in advance today at 24:00!

761
00:48:40,072 --> 00:48:46,072
誰？誰？誰？こっちのルイはわかるけど、こっちのルイは誰？誰なんだろう。
Who? Who? Who? I know this Lui, but who is this Lui? Who could it be?

762
00:48:46,072 --> 00:48:52,072
気になるねー。実はこの曲作った人も気にならない？
Curious, huh. Actually, aren't you curious about the person who made this song too?

763
00:48:52,072 --> 00:49:02,072
なんと魔眼ウインクを作ってくれた、テニヲハさんが今回も作成してくれたよー！あー、テニヲハ節確かに感じる！
Surprisingly, Tenioha-san, who made "Magan Wink", created this one too! Ah, I certainly feel the Tenioha style!

764
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:15,072
感じるよね。感じる感じる、めっちゃ感じる。そしてこの配信終了後には、MVが公開されます！
You feel it, right? Feel it, feel it, really feel it. And after this stream ends, the MV will be released!

765
00:49:15,072 --> 00:49:25,072
わー、MVさっき流れてたやつですか？そうなんですよ。なんと、高嶺ルイ史上初のオリジナルアニメMV、フルアニメMVを作らせていただきました。
Wow, is it the MV that was playing just now? That's right. Surprisingly, I was allowed to make Takane Lui's first ever original full anime MV.

766
00:49:25,072 --> 00:49:35,072
わーお、すごかった。めっちゃぬるぬる動いてた。ぬるぬる動いてたでしょ？しかも、なんか私が好きそうな絵のタッチじゃない？
Wow, that was amazing. It was moving so smoothly. Smoothly, right? And, isn't it an art style I'd seem to like?

767
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:45,072
あー、確かにね。なんと私ですね、すごいもう予てよりMV作っていただきたいなと思っていた、安田現象さんに...
Ah, certainly. Surprisingly, I... I've been thinking for a long time that I wanted him to make an MV, Yasuda Gensho-san...

768
00:49:45,072 --> 00:49:55,072
あの？あの安田現象さんですか？そうです。大丈夫ですか？現象さんですか？そうですね、大丈夫ですか？
That? That Yasuda Gensho-san? Yes. Are you okay? Gensho-san? Yes, are you okay?

769
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:06,680
作成をしていただいたフルアニメーションMVとなっております。
It's a fully animated MV created just for this.

770
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,580
わあ、すごい！サムネも可愛い！
Wow, amazing! The thumbnail is cute too!

771
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,580
可愛いでしょ？アッカンベーしてます。
Cute, right? I'm doing an 'akanbe'.

772
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,180
アッカンベーしてるね。
You are doing an 'akanbe'.

773
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:16,880
ということでこのね、「誰」というのは、内面にいる...
So, about this 'Who'... it's about the one inside...

774
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,580
まあ私... 私けっこう内面にアンチ持ってるんですけど。
Well, I actually have quite the 'anti' inside myself.

775
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,580
あ、そうなんだ。自分ので？
Oh, is that so? Your own?

776
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,880
そう、鷹嶺ルイのアンチを持ってるんですけど。
Yes, I have an anti of Takane Lui inside me.

777
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,880
「お前本当にこれできんのか？」みたいなね。
Like, 'Can you really do this?'

778
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,580
おお。
Oh.

779
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,580
「お前本当にやれんのか？」みたいな。
Like, 'Are you really gonna pull this off?'

780
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:32,280
そう... え、このなんか感情とか誰なん？みたいな。
So... like, 'Who is this feeling coming from?'

781
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,080
おお。
Oh.

782
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,580
うん。お... え、私なの？なんで私、私を否定してるの？みたいな。
Yeah. Like... 'Wait, is it me? Why am I denying myself?'

783
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,580
そういうね... 深い... 「誰」っていう...
It's that kind of... deep... 'Who'...

784
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,580
へえー！
Heeh!

785
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,280
そういう楽曲に仕上がっておりますし。
That's how the song turned out.

786
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,380
てか怖い言う、誰？
Wait, that sounds scary. Who?

787
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,080
誰？誰なの？私なの？
Who? Who is it? Is it me?

788
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,580
誰なんの？ふふふ。
Who is it? Fufufu.

789
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:54,080
という、えー、曲になっておりますので...
So, uh, that's the kind of song it is...

790
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:58,580
これからちょっとMVもね、あのプレミア公開させていただきますので...
I'll be doing a premiere release of the MV shortly as well...

791
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:02,080
ぜひぜひ楽しんでいただければなと思いますし。
So I hope you all enjoy it.

792
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,080
けっこう耳に残るサウンドになってますのでね。
It has a sound that really sticks in your ears.

793
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,580
ねえ、もう今後ろでイントロ流れてますけど...
Right? The intro is already playing in the background...

794
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,080
え、ほら早くフル聴きたいし...
I want to hear the full version soon...

795
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,180
もうなんなら今から歌ってもらえませんか？
Actually, could you just sing it for us now?

796
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,580
え？一緒に歌いますか？
Eh? Will you sing with me?

797
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:17,580
え、あ... うんと... ﾁｬﾁｬﾁｬ... うーん... HEY！... はい。
Eh, ah... um... Cha-cha-cha... hmm... HEY! ...Yes.

798
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,580
ちょっと歌えなそうですね。
Seems like you can't sing it.

799
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,580
ちょっとダメだ。
Yeah, no good.

800
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:24,080
ということでこの後、実は「誰」を...
So, right after this, actually...

801
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,080
先行で歌わせていただきます！
I'll be singing 'DARE' ahead of the release!

00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,080
すいちゃんもいなくなり、私一人でですね...

827
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,580
誰だ 誰 そちら様 どちら様
Who is it? Who? You there, who are you?

828
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,080
はてさてと Who are you? How are you?
Well now, Who are you? How are you?

829
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,580
お元気で 一足お先に
Take care, I'm going on ahead.

00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,580
てか Who are you? How are you?
I mean, Who are you? How are you?

832
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:44,280
一足お先に
...I'm going on ahead.

833
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,580
てか Who are you?
I mean, Who are you?

834
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,880
昨日の自分が描いた円から はみ出さないように
So as not to step out of the circle drawn by yesterday's self,

835
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,580
ひと回り小さな円を 描くような
Like drawing a circle one size smaller.

836
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:11,880
ボールのバウンドが少しずつ 低くなる様を
Watching the bounce of a ball get lower little by little,

837
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,880
術もなく 眺めているような気分でしょ
Feeling like you're watching it helplessly, right?

838
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,580
ところで貴方...
By the way, you...

839
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,580
DARE!?
WHO!?

840
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,580
誰 誰 誰
Who, who, who?

841
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,580
存じ上げないわ
I don't know you.

842
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:31,080
誰 誰 誰 存じ上げないわ
Who, who, who? I don't know you.

843
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:35,080
Who are you you you you どちら様
Who are you, you, you, you? Who is this?

844
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,880
Face to face こんにちは
Face to face, hello.

845
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:42,580
You & Me もなってたって Upside down for 自分 自分
You & Me become Upside down for myself, myself.

846
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,580
Look-alike? Not-alike? Like-or-Like?

847
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,880
通りゃんせ
You may pass.

848
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,580
てかまえ てかまえ てかまえは DARE!?
Wait, who's in front? In front? The one in front is WHO!?

849
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:56,580
昨日の自分は自分の手で 片付けましょう
Let's finish off yesterday's self with our own hands.

850
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,080
てか Who are you?
I mean, Who are you?

851
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,080
誰？
Who?

852
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,080
Look-alike

853
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,580
Look-alike la-ka-la-ka-la kami?
Look-alike la-ka-la-ka-la god?

854
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:08,580
Look-alike

855
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:14,580
つーかさ 確かに私が 私のこと見張り続けてる
I mean, certainly I am constantly watching over myself.

856
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,580
なのでクッと 背筋伸ばし 微笑むの
So I straighten my back with a jerk and smile.

857
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:25,580
徒花 誰に見られずとも 美しく咲くと言うけど
They say fleeting flowers bloom beautifully unseen by anyone,

858
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:30,580
風や虫にもそっぽ向かれたら 咲き方を改めるだろう
But if even the wind and insects turn away, you'd change how you bloom, right?

859
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,580
誰？
Who?

860
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,280
誰？
Who?

861
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,080
誰？
Who?

862
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,080
存じ上げないわ... 誰？
I don't know you... Who?

863
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:46,580
Who are you you you you どちら様
Who are you, you, you, you? Who is this?

864
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,880
Face to face こんばんは
Face to face, good evening.
