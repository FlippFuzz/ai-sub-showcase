00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,950
魂の色は
What color is

4
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,250
何色ですか
your soul?

6
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,400
「もういい」って 折れたままで
Saying "Enough", while staying broken,

7
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,400
捨てるほど
not strong enough to

8
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
逃げ出すほど
throw it away or run away,

9
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,300
強くないよ ほら
you see.

10
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,600
もう一度 鼓動、高鳴る
Once more, my heartbeat quickens.

11
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,450
何が正しいかなんて
I don't know what's right,

12
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,200
わからないけど
but...

13
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,150
形のないものばかりが
Only things without a shape

14
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,400
大切になっていく
are becoming important.

15
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,100
飾らない言葉だけが
Only unadorned words

16
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,300
強く結ばれてる
are strongly tied together.

17
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,500
また躓いて 転がって
Stumbling again, rolling,

18
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,550
それでも砕けない
and yet I won't break.

19
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,000
魂の色は
What color is

20
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,350
何色ですか
your soul?

21
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,550
叩きつけて 強がって
Striking down, acting tough,

22
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,950
それでも見つけたいよ
and yet I want to find it.

23
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,950
魂のカタチ
I'm confirming the shape

24
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,150
確かめてるよ
of my soul.

25
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,400
深い地の底で一人
Alone in the deep depths of the earth,

26
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,600
扉と鍵を探す
searching for the door and the key.

27
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,400
お伽話は ほら
Fairytales, you see,

28
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,450
泡の様に全部消えて
all vanish like bubbles,

29
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,300
葛藤、残像だけ
leaving only conflict and afterimages.

30
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,550
次のページへ
To the next page.

31
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,350
伸びていく枝葉が分かれて
The growing branches separate,

32
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,450
それぞれの道を行く
and each goes its own way.

33
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,950
寂しい思い出だけが
Only lonely memories

34
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,550
強く根を張ってる
are strongly taking root.

35
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,900
まだ貫いて 失って
Still piercing through, losing,

36
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,450
それでも挫けない
and yet I won't be discouraged.

37
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,200
心はどこに
Where is the heart?

38
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,350
器はどこに
Where is the vessel?

39
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,400
ただ残されて 抜け落ちて
Just left behind, falling out,

40
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,650
それでも伝えたいよ
and yet I want to convey it.

41
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,550
魂の日々を
The days of my soul,

42
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,250
魂の意志を
the will of my soul.

43
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,150
ずっと
Forever.

44
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:14,683
魂の色は
The color of the soul is...

45
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,483
何色ですか
What color is it?

46
00:05:21,783 --> 00:05:24,483
赤色ですか
Is it red?

47
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,383
青色ですか
Is it blue?

48
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:33,733
魂の色は
The color of the soul is...

49
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:35,433
魂の色は
The color of the soul is...

50
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:38,283
何色ですか
What color is it?

51
00:05:38,383 --> 00:05:40,433
何色ですか
What color is it?

52
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,083
透明な過去に
To a transparent past

53
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:44,833
不透明な明日に
To an opaque tomorrow

54
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:48,383
生きるあなたは
You who lives

55
00:05:48,483 --> 00:06:03,149
何色ですか
What color are you?

56
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:54,683
また躓いて
Tripping again

57
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,583
転がって
Rolling over

58
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:59,083
それでも砕けない
Yet still not breaking

59
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:00,683
魂の色は
The color of the soul is...

60
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,583
何色ですか
What color is it?

61
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,683
ただ傷ついて
Just getting hurt

62
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,583
強がって
Acting tough

63
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,183
それでも見つけたいよ
I still want to find it

64
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:10,783
魂のカタチ
The shape of the soul

65
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,783
確かめてるよ
I'm making sure

66
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:31,783
ずっと... (Woah...)
Forever... (Woah...)

67
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,433
AMANE KANATA REVENGE

68
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,583
Woah...

69
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,033
半端なら K.O.
Half-hearted means K.O.

70
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:54,633
今宵は...
Tonight...

71
00:06:54,833 --> 00:07:05,533
Hey! Hey! Yeah! Yeah!

72
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:08,533
なんだかってつまんない
Something's just boring

73
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,083
こともあるでしょう
There must be things like that

74
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:11,583
ロンリー論理のノート
Lonely logic notebook

75
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:13,083
ハンディー本気疾走
Handy serious sprint

76
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,583
やんちゃっちゃって泥に
Being mischievous in the mud

77
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,083
Bad ご法度なロゴが
Bad forbidden logo

78
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:17,583
溺れて堕ちて
Drowning and falling

79
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,083
そろそろいっか
Is it about time?

80
00:07:19,283 --> 00:07:20,583
もっと頑張って
Work harder

81
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:22,083
アガるまでもっと頑張って
Work harder until you're pumped

82
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:23,583
繋がろう独りよりふたり
Let's connect, two rather than one

83
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,083
増えたら安心心配ないや
More people means peace of mind, no worries

84
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,583
Alright 任せて Don't Mind
Alright, leave it to me, Don't Mind

85
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:28,083
波あり難題みんなで乗っちゃえば
Waves and challenges, let's all ride them

86
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:29,583
案外まく行ったりしそう
It might actually go surprisingly well

87
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:31,083
じゃいそう？じゃいそう！
Will it? It will!

88
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,583
半端なら K.O.
Half-hearted means K.O.

89
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:34,083
ふわふわしたいならどうぞ
If you want to feel lightheaded, go ahead

90
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:36,583
開演準備しちゃおうか
Shall we get ready for the show?

91
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:40,583
泣いても笑っても愛してね
Love me whether I cry or laugh

92
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:42,583
ほら Say No 低音響かせろ
Look, Say No, let the bass resonate

93
00:07:44,683 --> 00:07:49,083
Woah...

94
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:51,583
今宵は暗転パーティー
Tonight is a blackout party

95
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:54,583
Woah...

96
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,583
踊り出せ 踊り出せ
Start dancing, start dancing

97
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:58,583
孤独は殺菌 満員御礼
Sterilize loneliness, a full house

98
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,583
Woah...

99
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:02,583
痛みまでおシェアで
Sharing even the pain

100
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:04,583
心でバイバイ Let go
Goodbye in my heart, Let go

101
00:08:07,983 --> 00:08:09,583
どんな劣等感だって
Whatever inferiority complex you have

102
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:11,083
即興の血小板で
With improvised platelets

103
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:13,083
抑え込んで 突っ込んで 仕舞っちゃうでしょ
Suppress it, push into it, and put it away

104
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:15,583
Up and down テンション
Up and down tension

105
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:17,083
ねえまいっちゃってんの相当
Hey, you're pretty overwhelmed

106
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:18,583
ドバっと噴き出すのは
What bursts out

107
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:20,583
本音の独り言
Is a monologue of true feelings

108
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:23,083
別に興味ない
I'm not particularly interested

109
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:24,583
特に関係ない
It doesn't particularly matter

110
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:26,583
塞ぎ込んで 舌鋒鋭へ
Feeling down, sharpening the tongue

111
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:30,083
合図を奏でて Bra-bra-bra-player
Play the signal, Bra-bra-bra-player

112
00:08:30,783 --> 00:08:33,583
ほら集まって夜行行脚 Yeah
Look, gather round, nocturnal pilgrimage Yeah

113
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:40,083
鳴いていよう
Let's keep singing

114
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:51,583
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

115
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:53,583
サクッと行っちゃいそう
It feels like it'll go smoothly

116
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:56,583
Woah...

117
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,583
踊り出せ 踊り出せ
Start dancing, start dancing

118
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:00,583
孤独は殺菌 満員御礼
Sterilize loneliness, a full house

119
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,583
Woah...

120
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,583
痛みまでおシェアで
Sharing even the pain

121
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,083
今宵も暗転パーティーだ
Tonight is a blackout party again

122
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:08,583
Woah... (Woah...)

123
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,583
またのお越しを きっと
Come back again, surely

124
00:09:13,483 --> 00:09:15,583
Woah...

125
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,583
次回までお元気で
Stay well until next time

126
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,583
心でバイバイ Let go
Goodbye in my heart, Let go

127
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:22,583
Woah...

128
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:25,583
Hey! Hey! Hey!

129
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,583
ここでバイバイ Let go
Goodbye here, Let go

130
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:49,283
胸ぐらを掴まれて
Getting grabbed by the collar

131
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:51,083
強烈なパンチを
A heavy punch

132
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,383
食らってよろけて
Taking it and staggering

133
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:56,583
肩を並べ蹲った
Squatting side by side

134
00:09:56,783 --> 00:09:58,883
予報通りの雨に
In the rain that was forecast

135
00:09:58,883 --> 00:09:59,983
お前はニヤけて
You smirked

136
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,445
予報通りの雨　お前に射されて
Rain just as predicted, I'm struck by you

137
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:04,545
「傷口が綺麗に映る」　なんて嘘をつく
"Wounds look beautiful," you lie to me

138
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:08,745
いつも口喧嘩さえ
Even though you're no good

139
00:10:08,745 --> 00:10:10,545
上手く出来ないくせして
at having a simple argument

140
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:12,845
冴えない冗談言うなよ
Don't tell those lame jokes

141
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,545
あまりのつまらなさに目が潤んだ
My eyes welled up because it was so boring

142
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:18,045
何度も　青アザだらけで涙を
Time and again, covered in bruises, shedding tears

143
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:20,545
流して流して
on and on

144
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:23,045
不安定な心を
Resting our unstable hearts

145
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:25,845
肩に預け合いながら
on each other's shoulders

146
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:30,545
腐り切ったバッドエンドに抗う
Resisting this rotten bad end

147
00:10:30,545 --> 00:10:35,545
なぜだろう　喜びよりも心地よい
I wonder why, it feels better than joy

148
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:40,545
痛み　ずっしりと響いて
This heavy pain resonating within

149
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:43,145
濡れた服に　舌打ちしながら
Clicking our tongues at wet clothes

150
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:45,845
腫れ上がった顔見合って笑う
we look at our swollen faces and laugh

151
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:50,545
土砂降りの夜に
On a night of downpouring rain

152
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:55,245
誓ったリベンジ
The revenge we swore

153
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,845
胸ぐらを掴み返して
Grab them by the collar

154
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:08,545
反撃のパンチを
and throw a counter punch

155
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:11,245
繰り出すくらいじゃなきゃ
If I can't do at least that

156
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:13,845
お前の隣には立てないから
I can't stand by your side

157
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:16,245
相手が何であれ日和らない
No matter who the opponent is, don't waver

158
00:11:16,245 --> 00:11:18,845
何度負かされても諦めない
don't give up even if defeated

159
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,245
忘れるな　忘れるなと
Don't forget, don't forget

160
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:23,845
言い聞かせ続けてたのに
I kept telling myself

161
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:31,045
どうして...
Why...?

162
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:04,545
傘はいらないから
I don't need an umbrella

163
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:07,545
言葉を一つ作らないか
so shall we create a single word?

164
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:13,545
微温い優しさではなく
Not a lukewarm kindness

165
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:16,545
弱音に侵された胸の奥を
but a word that carves into the depth

166
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:22,045
抉るような言葉を
of a heart invaded by weakness

167
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:30,545
何度も　青アザだらけで涙を
Time and again, covered in bruises, shedding tears

168
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:33,245
流して流して
on and on

169
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:35,845
不安定な心を
Resting our unstable hearts

170
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:38,245
肩に預け合いながら
on each other's shoulders

171
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:43,045
腐り切ったバッドエンドに抗う
Resisting this rotten bad end

172
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:47,845
なぜだろう　喜びよりも心地よい
I wonder why, it feels better than joy

173
00:12:47,845 --> 00:12:52,545
痛み　ずっしりと響いて
This heavy pain resonating within

174
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:55,245
濡れた服に　舌打ちしながら
Clicking our tongues at wet clothes

175
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:58,245
腫れ上がった顔見合って笑う
we look at our swollen faces and laugh

176
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:03,545
土砂降りの夜に
On a night of downpouring rain

177
00:13:03,545 --> 00:13:08,545
誓ったリベンジ
The revenge we swore

178
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:13,545
土砂降りの夜に
On a night of downpouring rain

179
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:18,545
囚われの日々に
In the days of being trapped

180
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:22,545
問いかけるように
As if questioning

181
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:24,045
光った瞳の中で
within those shining eyes

182
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:28,045
誓ったリベンジ
The revenge we swore

183
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:41,545
深夜東京の6畳半　夢を見てた
In a six-and-a-half mat room in late-night Tokyo, I was dreaming

184
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:43,245
灯りの灯らない蛍光灯
Unlit fluorescent lights

185
00:13:43,245 --> 00:13:46,045
明日には消えてる電脳城に
in a cyber castle that will be gone by tomorrow

186
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:49,045
開幕戦打ち上げて　いかなくちゃないよね
I have to launch the opening battle and go, don't I?

187
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:51,545
ここには誰もいない
No one is here

188
00:13:51,545 --> 00:13:55,245
ここには誰もいないから
because no one is here

189
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:59,045
春を告げる
Haru wo Tsugeru

190
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:13,545
ここに救いはないよ
There is no salvation here

191
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:15,545
早く行っておいでおいで
go on, go quickly

192
00:14:15,545 --> 00:14:18,045
難しい話はやめよう
Let's stop the difficult talk

193
00:14:18,045 --> 00:14:20,545
とりあえず上がって酒でも飲んでさ
for now just come up and have a drink

194
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:23,245
いつも誰にでも言っていることを
Saying the same thing you always say to everyone

195
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:25,545
繰り返してる
Repeating it

196
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:29,045
完璧な演出と
A perfect performance and

197
00:14:29,045 --> 00:14:31,545
完璧な人生を
a perfect life

198
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:35,845
幼少期の面影は誰も知らないんだ
No one knows the traces of childhood

199
00:14:35,845 --> 00:14:38,245
誰もがマイノリティなタイムトラベラー
Everyone is a minority time traveler

200
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:41,045
ほら真夜中はすぐそこさ
look, midnight is right there

201
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:43,045
さあ
Now

202
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:45,545
深夜東京の6畳半　夢を見てた
In a six-and-a-half mat room in late-night Tokyo, I was dreaming

203
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:48,045
灯りの灯らない蛍光灯
Unlit fluorescent lights

204

I have to launch the opening battle and go, don't I?

206
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:55,545
ここには誰もいない
No one is here

207
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:58,245
ここには誰もいない
No one is here

208
00:15:15,357 --> 00:15:18,857
明日世界は終わるんだって 昨日は眠れなくて
"I heard the world ends tomorrow," I couldn't sleep last night.

209
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:22,557
あぁ 小さな記憶の箱は 夜の海に浮かんでる
Ah, a small box of memories floats on the night sea.

210
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:27,557
僕らを描いたあの絵の中に 吸い込まれるように
As if being sucked into that painting that depicted us.

211
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:29,557
週末旅行を楽しもう
Let's enjoy our weekend voyage,

212
00:15:29,557 --> 00:15:31,557
どうせ全部今日で終わるんだから
since everything ends today anyway.

213
00:15:47,357 --> 00:15:49,257
深夜東京の6畳半
In a 6-tatami room in late-night Tokyo,

214
00:15:49,257 --> 00:15:51,257
夢を見ていた
I was dreaming.

215
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:53,457
灯りの灯らない蛍光灯
Fluorescent lights that don't turn on,

216
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:55,357
明日には消えてる電脳城に
in the cyber castle that will vanish tomorrow.

217
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:59,257
開幕戦打ち上げて いなくなんないよね
Setting off the opening battle, you won't disappear, right?

218
00:15:59,457 --> 00:16:03,157
ここには誰もいない ここには誰もいない
No one is here. No one is here.

219
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:06,657
深夜東京の6畳半 夢を見ていた
In a 6-tatami room in late-night Tokyo, I was dreaming.

220
00:16:06,857 --> 00:16:10,957
灯りの灯らない蛍光灯 明日には消えてる電脳城に
Fluorescent lights that don't turn on, in the cyber castle that will vanish tomorrow.

221
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:14,957
開幕戦打ち上げて いなくなんないよね
Setting off the opening battle, you won't disappear, right?

222
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:20,057
ここには誰もいない ここには誰もいないから
Because no one is here. Because no one is here.

223
00:16:59,057 --> 00:17:02,557
Party is over.

224
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:08,557
それでも踊りたかった
Even so, I wanted to dance.

225
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:13,557
眠れないくらい
Enough to keep me from sleeping.

226
00:17:14,257 --> 00:17:19,457
情熱の火はいつしか いつの日にか
The fire of passion will, before I know it, someday...

227
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:22,557
はなから気付いている
I've known from the start,

228
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:25,557
焔はいつか消える
the flame will one day go out.

229
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:28,157
ねぇ 何も要らないはずだったのに
Hey, I wasn't supposed to need anything,

230
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:30,257
まだ I'm so serious
but I'm still so serious.

231
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:37,557
あぁ あぁ 間に合う
Ah, ah, I'll make it in time.

232
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,557
Burn it up.

233
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:45,357
Baby, Sorry darling そんなに甘くないよ
Baby, Sorry darling, it's not that sweet.

234
00:17:45,557 --> 00:17:48,057
でもきっとそんなに悪くないよ
But I'm sure it's not that bad.

235
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:51,557
Give me fire.

236
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:55,057
Light it up Baby 燃やしちゃおうぜ yeah
Light it up Baby, let's burn it up, yeah.

238
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:27,557
燃えろよ 燃えろよ 炎よ 燃えろ
Burn, burn, o flame, burn.

239
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:30,057
千代も八千代も 変わりもせずに
For thousands of ages, without changing.

240
00:18:30,057 --> 00:18:33,057
人のなりとかし全部 燃やせや ああ よしよし
Melting all human form, burn it all, ah, there there.

241
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:35,757
出でよ 舞えよ 火の粉 焚き付けるのが仕事
Come forth, dance, sparks, fanning the flames is the job.

242
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:38,557
ガソリンとステロイド 燃える様はお見事
Gasoline and steroids, the way it burns is magnificent.

243
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:41,057
火遊びはしない ぬるい真似はしない
No playing with fire, no lukewarm acting.

244
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:44,257
無理、しけた火を ドラマ 燃やし尽くす マグマ ドラマ
Impossible, a damp fire, drama, burning everything up, magma drama.

245
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,057
この飽くなき渇き 青い炎みたい
This insatiable thirst, like a blue flame.

246
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:50,557
死はひとつ隣 やがて総てひとつ隣
Death is right next to you, soon everything will be right next to it.

247
00:18:50,857 --> 00:18:54,557
Love is dying.

248
00:18:55,257 --> 00:19:00,557
でもまだ消えてないから
But it hasn't gone out yet.

249
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:05,057
忘れてみたい
I want to try and forget.

250
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:11,057
情熱の火はいつしか いつの日にか
The fire of passion will, before I know it, someday...

251
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:17,557
身体は気付いている 僕らはいつか消える
My body realizes, we will one day disappear.

252
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:21,057
ゆるやかに若さを溶かして
Gently melting away youth,

253
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:23,557
泣かないで Why so serious?
don't cry, Why so serious?

254
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:30,057
あぁ あぁ 間に合う
Ah, ah, I'll make it in time.

255

Baby, Sorry darling そんなに甘くないよ
Baby, Sorry darling, it's not that sweet.

But I'm sure it's not that bad.

258
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:43,557
Give me fire.

Light it up Baby 燃やしちゃおうぜ yeah

00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:07,819
Turn it up…足りない 注ぐ火に油！
Turn it up… Not enough, pour oil on the fire!

261
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:10,869
Sorry darling Hurry up ああまだ間に合う？
Sorry darling Hurry up, ah is it still in time?

それでも踊りたかった
Still, I wanted to dance

267
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:51,419
現る黒い空
A black sky appears

268
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:57,469
鼓動は雷鳴を繰り返す
My heartbeat repeats the thunder

269

嵐がくる前に
Before the storm comes

270

オリジナル曲 制作決定
Original Song Production Decided

307
00:25:55,281 --> 00:26:00,581
有象無象 人の成り 虚勢 心象 人外 物の怪みたいだ
Various people, in human form, bluffs, mental images, like monsters.

308
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:05,581
虚心坦懐 命宿し あとはぱっぱらぱんな中身なき人間
Open-hearted, life dwells within, then it's just empty humans.

309
00:26:05,881 --> 00:26:11,081
寄せる期待 不平等な人生 才能もない 大抵 非日常が
Expectations gather, an unequal life, no talent, mostly the extraordinary...

310
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:16,281
怨親平等に没個性 辿る記憶 僕に居場所などないから
Impartial to friends and foes, losing individuality, tracing memories, for I have no place.

311
00:26:16,481 --> 00:26:21,281
夢の狭間で泣いてないで どんな顔すればいいか分かってる
Don't cry in the gap between dreams, I know what kind of face I should make.

312
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:26,281
だけどまだ応えてくれよ
But please, still answer me.

313
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:30,881
闇を祓って 闇を祓って 夜の帳が下りたら合図だ
Exorcise the darkness, exorcise the darkness, it's the signal when night falls.

314
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:36,081
相対して 廻る環状線 戯言などは 吐き捨ていけと
Facing each other, the revolving loop, cast aside all the nonsense and go.

315
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:41,281
まだ止めないで まだ止めないで 誰よりも聡く在る街に生まれし
Don't stop yet, don't stop yet, born in a city that's smarter than anyone.

316
00:26:41,481 --> 00:26:46,281
この正体を 今はただ 呪い呪われた僕の未来を創造して
This identity, for now, just create the future of my cursed self.

317
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:51,281
走って 転んで 消えない痛み抱いては
Running, falling, embracing the pain that won't fade.

318
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:56,281
世界が待ってる この一瞬を
The world is waiting for this moment.

319
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:09,281
叙情的感情が揺らいでいくバグ 従順に従った欠陥の罰
A bug where emotions waver, the punishment of a flaw that followed obediently.

320
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:14,281
死守選択しかない愛に無常気 声も出せないまま
Indifferent to love with only a choice to defend, unable to make a sound.

321
00:27:14,481 --> 00:27:19,481
傀儡な誓いの街百鬼夜行 数珠繋ぎなこの果てまでも
Night parade in a city of puppet oaths, even to this linked end.

322
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:24,481
極楽往生 現実蹴って 命を投げ出さないで
Rebirth in paradise, kicking reality, don't throw your life away.

323
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:29,481
内の脆さに浸って どんな顔すればいいか分かんないよ
Immersed in internal fragility, I don't know what face I should make.

324
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:34,481
今はただ応えてくれよ
For now, just answer me.

325
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:39,481
五常を解いて 五常を解いて 不確かな声を紡ぐイデア
Unravel the constants, unravel the constants, the idea that weaves uncertain voices.

326
00:27:39,681 --> 00:27:44,481
相殺して 廻る感情線 その先に今 立ち上がる手を
Offsetting, the revolving line of emotion, to the hand that rises up now.

327
00:27:44,681 --> 00:27:49,481
ただ追いかけて ただ追いかけて 誰よりも強く在りたいと願う
Just chasing, just chasing, wishing to be stronger than anyone.

328
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:54,481
君の運命すら 今はただ 仄暗い夜の底に深く深く落ち込んで
Even your fate, for now, just sinking deep into the bottom of the dim night.

329
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:19,081
不格好に見えたかい これが今の僕なんだ
Did I look unsightly? This is who I am now.

330
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:24,081
何者にもなれやしないだけの 屍を嗤えよ
Sneer at the corpse that just can't become anything.

331
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:29,281
目の前の全てから 逃げることさえやめた
I've even stopped running away from everything in front of me.

332
00:28:29,481 --> 00:28:34,281
イメージを繰り返し 想像の先をいけと
Repeating images, tell me to go beyond imagination.

333
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:38,881
闇を祓って 闇を祓って 夜の帳が下りたら合図だ
Exorcise the darkness, exorcise the darkness, it's the signal when night falls.

334
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:44,081
相対して 廻る環状線 戯言などは 吐き捨ていけと
Facing each other, the revolving loop, cast aside all the nonsense and go.

335
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:49,281
まだ止めないで まだ止めないで 誰よりも聡く在る街に生まれし
Don't stop yet, don't stop yet, born in a city that's smarter than anyone.

336
00:28:49,481 --> 00:28:54,281
この正体を 今はただ 呪い呪われた僕の未来を創造して
This identity, for now, just create the future of my cursed self.

337
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:59,281
走って 転んで 消えない痛み抱いては
Running, falling, embracing the pain that won't fade.

338
00:28:59,481 --> 00:29:04,281
世界が待ってる この一瞬を
The world is waiting for this moment.

339
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:31,281
嗚呼、いつもの様に 過ぎる日々に あくびが出る
Ah, yawning at the days passing by as usual.

340
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:39,281
さんざめく夜、越え 今日も 渋谷の街に朝が降る
Crossing the bustling night, morning falls on Shibuya again today.

341
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:44,281
どこか虚しいような そんな気持ち
A feeling that is somehow empty.

342
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:46,281
つまらないな
How boring.

343
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:50,281
でもそれでいい そんなもんさ これでいい
But that's fine. That's just how it is. This is fine.

344
00:29:50,481 --> 00:29:54,281
(知らず知らず隠してた) (本当の声を響かせてよ、ほら)
(Hidden away without knowing) (Let your true voice ring out, look)

345
00:29:54,481 --> 00:29:58,281
(見ないフリしていたっても) (確かにそこに居る)
(Even if you pretend not to see) (It's definitely there)

346
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:03,593
（見ないフリしていても）
（確かにはそこにある）
(Even if I pretend not to see it)
(It is definitely there)

347
00:30:04,593 --> 00:30:10,593
嗚呼 感じたままに描く
自分で選んだその色で
Ah, I'll draw it as I feel
With the colors I've chosen for myself

348
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:18,593
眠い空気纏う朝に 訪れた青い世界
In the morning clad in sleepy air, a blue world arrived

349
00:30:19,093 --> 00:30:25,093
好きなものを好きだと言う
怖くて仕方ないけど
Saying I like what I like
I can't help but be afraid

350
00:30:25,593 --> 00:30:30,093
本当の自分出会えた気がしたんだ
I felt like I finally met my true self

351
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:46,593
嗚呼、手を伸ばせば 伸ばすほどに 遠くへゆく
Ah, the more I reach out my hand, the further it goes

352
00:30:47,093 --> 00:30:54,093
思うようにいかない今日も また慌ただしくもがいてる
Today doesn't go as I thought, I'm struggling frantically again

353
00:30:54,593 --> 00:31:00,093
悔しい気持ちもただ 情けなくて 涙が出る
Even this frustrating feeling, just so pathetic, tears come out

354
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:07,593
踏み込むほど 苦しくなる 痛くもなる
The more I step in, the more painful and agonizing it becomes

355
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:14,593
嗚呼 感じたままに進む 自分で選んだこの道を
Ah, I'll move forward as I feel, on this path I've chosen for myself

356
00:31:15,093 --> 00:31:22,593
重い目蓋擦る夜に しがみついた青い誓い
In the night rubbing heavy eyelids, I clung to a blue oath

357
00:31:23,093 --> 00:31:29,093
好きなことを続けること それは楽しいだけじゃない
Continuing to do what I love, it's not just about fun

358
00:31:29,593 --> 00:31:33,593
本当にできる？ 不安になるけど
Can I really do it? I get anxious, but...

359
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:40,593
何回でも ほら何回でも 自信がないから描いてきたんだよ
Again and again, look, again and again, I've drawn because I lacked confidence

360
00:31:41,093 --> 00:31:47,593
何回でも ほら何回でも 積み上げてきたことが武器になる
Again and again, look, again and again, what I've built up will become my weapon

361
00:31:48,093 --> 00:31:54,593
周りを見たって 誰と比べたって 僕にしかできないことはあんだ
Even if I look around, even if I compare with others, there are things only I can do

362
00:31:55,093 --> 00:32:00,593
今でも 自信なんかない それでも
Even now, I don't have any confidence, but still...

363
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:07,093
感じたことない気持ち 知らずにいた想い
Feelings I've never felt, thoughts I didn't know I had

364
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:14,093
あの日踏み出して 初めて感じたこの痛みも全部
Stepping out that day, even all this pain I felt for the first time

365
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:21,093
好きなものと向き合うことで 触れたまだ小さな光
By facing what I like, I touched a light that's still small

366
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:26,593
大丈夫、行こう あとは楽しむだけだ
It's okay, let's go. All that's left is to enjoy it

367
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:35,093
嗚呼 全てを賭けて描く 自分にしか出せない色で
Ah, I'll draw by betting everything, with colors only I can produce

368
00:32:35,593 --> 00:32:42,593
朝も夜も走り続け 見つけ出した青い光
Running through both morning and night, I found the blue light

369
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:49,093
好きなものと向き合うこと 今だって怖いことだけど
Facing what I like, even now it's a scary thing, but...

370
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:55,593
もう今は あの日の透明な僕じゃない
I'm no longer that transparent version of myself from that day

371
00:32:57,093 --> 00:33:00,593
嗚呼 ありのままの かけがえのない僕だ
Ah, I'm just as I am, irreplaceable

372
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:08,093
（知らず知らず隠してた）
（本当の声を響かせてよ ほら）
(I was hiding it without knowing)
(Let your true voice resound, look)

373
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:15,093
（見ないフリしていても）
（確かにはそこには今もそこにある）
(Even if you pretend not to see it)
(It is definitely there, still there now)

374
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:22,093
（知らず知らず隠してた）
（本当の声を響かせてよ さあ）
(I was hiding it without knowing)
(Let your true voice resound, come on)

375
00:33:22,093 --> 00:33:29,093
（見ないフリしていても）
（確かにはそこに君の中に）
(Even if you pretend not to see it)
(It is definitely there, inside you)

376
00:33:38,593 --> 00:33:41,093
Don't take your love away.
You ain't heard nothin' yet-yet.

377
00:33:41,593 --> 00:33:44,093
Don't take your love away.
Wake up, make up, bang bang.

378
00:33:44,293 --> 00:33:49,093
また鳴り出した表示はあなた「今、忙しいの」
The display started ringing again, it's you. "I'm busy right now."

379
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:49,093
[A]ddiction feat.Mori Calliope

380
00:33:50,093 --> 00:33:55,593
未読のトークとラブコールも
いっぱいでせわしない「邪魔をしないで頂戴」
Unread chats and love calls,
it's too much and busy. "Please don't disturb me."

381
00:33:56,093 --> 00:33:58,593
Cuz you refuse cooperation, better stick out your lip

382
00:33:58,593 --> 00:34:01,593
Too used to sayin' "I don't wanna",
no doubt you're still a kid

383
00:34:02,093 --> 00:34:04,593
本音は言わない方が悩ましい
It's more troublesome not to say what you're really thinking

384
00:34:05,093 --> 00:34:08,593
甘い言葉かけるよりもずっと愛しい
Far more lovely than saying sweet words

385
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:13,593
たまらなく欲するほど 求めて離さないで
So much that it's unbearable, seek me and don't let go

386
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:18,593
キスじゃ足りなくて いっそ殺して
A kiss isn't enough, just kill me instead

387
00:34:19,093 --> 00:34:21,593
Predilection あなたを手に掛けて
Predilection, getting my hands on you

388
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,593
Infatuation 呼吸さえ止めて
Infatuation, even stopping my breath

389
00:34:25,093 --> 00:34:27,093
Dedication このまま
Dedication, just like this

390
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:30,593
Addiction してまだたった一口で「終わり」
Addiction, and yet just one taste and it's over

391
00:34:31,093 --> 00:34:33,593
Predilection さあ口をつけて
Predilection, now put your mouth to it

392
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:36,593
Infatuation そのまま飲み込んで
Infatuation, just swallow it as is

393
00:34:37,093 --> 00:34:38,593
Dedication すぐさま
Dedication, immediately

394
00:34:39,093 --> 00:34:42,593
Addiction してほらたった一口
死ぬほど愛したいから
Addiction, look, just one taste
Because I want to love you to death

395
00:34:43,093 --> 00:34:45,593
Don't take your love away.
You ain't heard nothin' yet-yet.

396
00:34:46,093 --> 00:34:49,093
Don't take your love away.
Wake up, make up, bang bang.

397
00:34:49,093 --> 00:34:54,593
Uh, have it all, like it love is overflowing
Be the only one you got, I don't think you'll be going, going

398
00:34:55,093 --> 00:35:00,093
Uh, take it off, still it's not enough for me
Stuck. With. You. There's no room for other things.

399
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:04,289
胸を刺したこの手掴んだ
I grasped this hand that pierced my chest,

400
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:06,429
まだ未練があるのね
You still have lingering regrets, don't you?

401
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:07,563
ああまただわ
Ah, there it goes again,

402
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,629
ワガママ
Your selfishness.

403
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:13,169
愛と名付けてまた支配する
Naming it love, you dominate once more.

404
00:35:13,169 --> 00:35:15,649
あなたに溺れてく
I'm drowning in you,

405
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:18,629
息苦しいくらいに
To the point of suffocation.

406
00:35:18,629 --> 00:35:23,169
心酔させていっそうして
Mesmerize me, even more so.

407
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:25,069
Predilection

408
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:26,649
わたしを手に掛けて
Lay your hands on me

409
00:35:26,649 --> 00:35:27,529
Infatuation

410
00:35:27,529 --> 00:35:29,669
キスで口塞いで
Seal my lips with a kiss

411
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,509
Dedication

412
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:31,609
まだまだ
Not yet, not yet

413
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:32,529
Addiction

414
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:35,649
してまた雑多、非合理的な愛
And again, a cluttered, irrational love.

415
00:35:35,649 --> 00:35:37,089
Predilection

416
00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:38,629
喉奥流し込んで
Pour it down my throat

417
00:35:38,629 --> 00:35:39,569
Infatuation

418
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:41,149
躊躇いなど捨てて
Throw away all hesitation

419
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:42,589
Dedication

420
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:43,569
すぐさま
Immediately

421
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:44,509
Addiction

422
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:48,169
してほらたった一口 これで終わらせないで
See, just one mouthful. Don't let it end here.

423
00:35:48,169 --> 00:35:51,129
Our love's, love's continue to further evolve more.

424
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:53,969
My love love is besotted with you.

425
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:58,169
You love? love? continue to further evolve mo-mo-more!

426
00:35:58,169 --> 00:36:00,129
I'm a little confused.

427
00:36:00,129 --> 00:36:02,149
You already know it, love is war
What you gotta act righteous for?

428
00:36:02,149 --> 00:36:05,129
Won't ya come and fight me?
Shit, Aphrodite was supposed to only wanna be adored

429
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:08,129
"You can ditch your world. Cuz I'm all you need."
With those wild words, I fall to my knees.

430
00:36:08,129 --> 00:36:11,169
In the end, the reason isn't hard to see
Understanding "love," it just ain't for me

431
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:14,149
たまらなくなるほど
To the point it's unbearable,

432
00:36:14,149 --> 00:36:17,169
求めて離さないで
Reach for me and don't let go.

433
00:36:17,169 --> 00:36:19,649
キスじゃ足りなくて
A kiss isn't enough,

434
00:36:19,649 --> 00:36:23,129
いっそ殺して
Just kill me instead.

435
00:36:24,169 --> 00:36:25,049
Predilection

436
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,129
あなたを手に掛けて
Lay my hands on you

437
00:36:27,129 --> 00:36:28,069
Infatuation

438
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:30,149
呼吸さえ止めて
Even stopping your breath

439
00:36:30,149 --> 00:36:31,029
Dedication

440
00:36:31,029 --> 00:36:32,069
まだまだ
Not yet, not yet

441
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:33,049
Addiction

442
00:36:33,049 --> 00:36:36,169
してまたたった一口で「終わり」
And again, it's the 'end' in just one mouthful.

443
00:36:36,169 --> 00:36:37,089
Predilection

444
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:38,649
さあさあ口をうけて
Now, now, open your mouth

445
00:36:38,649 --> 00:36:39,529
Infatuation

446
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:41,629
そのまま飲み込んで
And swallow it just like that

447
00:36:41,629 --> 00:36:43,029
Dedication

448
00:36:43,029 --> 00:36:44,089
すぐさま
Immediately

449
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:45,029
Addiction

450
00:36:45,029 --> 00:36:50,169
サヨナラ真っ赤、吐き出して 息が止まるのよ今
Goodbye bright red, spit it out. My breath is stopping now.

451
00:37:08,629 --> 00:37:24,169
愛して愛して愛して
Love me, love me, love me

452
00:37:24,169 --> 00:37:30,169
はるか遠い遠い昔　巻かれた首輪
A long, long time ago, a collar was placed.

453
00:37:30,169 --> 00:37:36,669
人が欲しい　人が欲しいと　叫ぶ呪いの首輪
A cursed collar that screams for people, for people.

454
00:37:36,669 --> 00:37:42,649
怒らないで　見捨てないで　どこも行かないで
Don't be angry, don't abandon me, don't go anywhere.

455
00:37:42,649 --> 00:37:46,649
強く締める　吐くまで締める　人がいない　いないと
Tighten it hard, until I vomit. There's no one, no one.

456
00:37:49,129 --> 00:37:51,629
いい成績でしょ
I have good grades, right?

457
00:37:51,629 --> 00:37:54,629
ねえ　ねえ　いい子でしょ
Hey, hey, I'm a good child, right?

458
00:37:54,629 --> 00:37:58,629
かわいい子でしょ
I'm a cute child, right?

459
00:37:58,629 --> 00:38:01,629
ねえ　ねえ　いい子でしょ
Hey, hey, I'm a good child, right?

460
00:38:01,629 --> 00:38:05,129
苦しいねえ
It's painful, isn't it?

461
00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:08,129
愛して　愛して　愛して
Love me, love me, love me,

462
00:38:08,129 --> 00:38:14,129
もっともっと 愛して 愛して
More and more. Love me, love me.

463
00:38:14,129 --> 00:38:17,629
狂おしいほどに
To the point of madness.

464
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,629
苦しい　苦しい
It's painful, it's painful.

465
00:38:20,629 --> 00:38:26,629
呪縛を　解いて　解いて　ねえ
The curse... unravel it, unravel it, hey.

466
00:38:27,129 --> 00:38:30,129
止められない
It can't be stopped.

467
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:36,129
嗚呼
Aah

468
00:39:01,629 --> 00:39:07,629
身体　身体　太く成っても　小さい首輪
Body, body, even if it grows big, the collar is small.

469
00:39:07,629 --> 00:39:14,129
苦しくなる　足りなく成る　人が　人が　足りない
It becomes painful, it becomes insufficient. People, people are not enough.

470
00:39:14,129 --> 00:39:20,129
クラスの誰にも負けない　キレイな子でしょう
I'm a beautiful child who won't lose to anyone in class, right?

471
00:39:20,129 --> 00:39:24,129
あの娘よりも　どの娘よりも
More than that girl, more than any girl,

472
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:26,629
誰も彼も　私を見てよ
Everyone, look at me.

473
00:39:26,629 --> 00:39:30,129
体育館裏　あなたに告白を
Behind the gym, I'll confess to you.

474
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:35,129
望みたいでしょ
It's what you want, isn't it?

475
00:39:35,129 --> 00:39:39,129
あなたが好きなの
I like you.

476
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:42,129
汚いあなたが
The filthy you.

477
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:48,129
愛して　愛して　愛して　全部あげる
Love me, love me, love me, I'll give you everything.

478
00:39:48,129 --> 00:39:54,129
あなたに　あなたに　全部背負って貰うよ
To you, to you, I'll have you carry everything.

479
00:39:54,129 --> 00:39:59,129
足りない　あなたが　足りない
Not enough, you are not enough.

480
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:04,117
離さないよ 嗚呼
I won't let go, ah

481
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:06,617
ごめんなさい
I'm sorry

482
00:40:07,217 --> 00:40:13,617
愛して 愛して 愛して もっともっと
Love me, love me, love me, more and more

483
00:40:13,617 --> 00:40:19,617
愛して 愛して 狂おしいほどに
Love me, love me, until it's maddening

484
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,617
苦しい 離さない
It hurts, I won't let go

485
00:40:22,617 --> 00:40:25,617
苦しい もっともっと
It hurts, more and more

486
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:28,617
ねえ
Hey

487
00:40:29,117 --> 00:40:32,117
幸せの
Of happiness

488
00:40:54,117 --> 00:41:00,117
幸せの 嗚呼
Of happiness, ah

489
00:41:19,517 --> 00:41:21,617
あたしが愛を語るのなら
If I were to speak of love,

490
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:23,817
その眼には如何、映る？
how would it look in your eyes?

491
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:25,917
詞は有り余るばかり
Words are more than enough,

492
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:28,117
無垢の音が流れてく
the sound of innocence flows on.

493
00:41:28,117 --> 00:41:30,217
あなたが愛にまみれるまで
Until you are covered in love,

494
00:41:30,217 --> 00:41:32,417
その色は幻だ
that color is an illusion.

495
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:34,517
ひとりぼっち 音に呑まれれば
If you're all alone and swallowed by sound,

496
00:41:34,517 --> 00:41:36,717
全世界共通の快楽さ
it's a pleasure common to the whole world.

497
00:41:38,117 --> 00:41:42,117
アンノウン・マザーグース 作詞：wowaka 作曲：wowaka
Unknown Mother Goose | Lyrics: wowaka | Composition: wowaka

498
00:41:54,117 --> 00:41:57,417
つまらない 呆然に溺れる 暮らしたれもが彼をなぞる
Drowning in a dull daze, everyone living traces after him.

499
00:41:57,417 --> 00:42:00,817
繰り返す使い回しの歌に また耳を塞いだ
I covered my ears again to the repetitive, reused songs.

500
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:05,217
あなたが愛を語るのなら それを答えとするの？
If you were to speak of love, would you make that the answer?

501
00:42:05,217 --> 00:42:08,617
目をつぶったふりをしてるなら
If you're pretending to have your eyes closed,

502
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:11,917
この曲で醒ましてくれ
then wake me up with this song.

503
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:15,117
誰も知らぬ物語 思うばかり
Thinking only of a story no one knows.

504
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:20,117
壊れそうなくらいに 抱き締めて泣き踊った
I held on so tight it felt like I'd break, and danced while crying.

505
00:42:20,117 --> 00:42:22,217
見境無い感情論 許されるのならば
If such indiscriminate emotionalism could be forgiven...

506
00:42:22,217 --> 00:42:24,317
泣き出すことすらできないまま 飲み込んでった
Unable to even burst into tears, I just swallowed it down.

507
00:42:24,317 --> 00:42:27,617
張り裂けてしまいそうな心があるってこと、叫ばせて！
Let me scream that I have a heart that feels like it's about to burst!

508
00:42:29,117 --> 00:42:33,117
世界があたしを拒んでも 今、
Even if the world rejects me, now,

509
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:37,117
愛の唄 歌わせてくれないか
won't you let me sing a song of love?

510
00:42:37,417 --> 00:42:41,617
もう一回 誰も知らないその想い
One more time, those feelings that no one knows...

511
00:42:41,617 --> 00:42:46,117
この声に預けてみてもいいか
...can I entrust them to this voice?

512
00:42:46,317 --> 00:42:48,617
あなたには僕が見えるか？
Can you see me?

513
00:42:48,617 --> 00:42:50,917
あなたには僕が見えるか？
Can you see me?

514
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:55,317
ガラクタばかり 投げつけられてきたその背中
That back that's had nothing but junk thrown at it.

515
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:57,617
それでも好きと言えたら
If I could still say I love it,

516
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,917
それでも好きを願えたら
if I could still wish for love,

517
00:42:59,917 --> 00:43:03,617
ああ、あたしの全部に その意味はあると
ah, that there's meaning in all of me.

518
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:33,117
ねえ、愛を語るのなら 今その胸には誰がいる
Hey, if you're speaking of love, who's in your heart right now?

519
00:43:33,117 --> 00:43:37,417
こころの箱を抉じ開けて さあ、生き写しのあなた見せて？
Pry open the box of your heart and show me the spitting image of yourself.

520
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:41,817
あたしが愛にまみれるのなら 今その色は何色だ
If I'm to be covered in love, what color is it now?

521
00:43:41,817 --> 00:43:47,017
孤独なんて記号では収まらない 心臓を抱えて生きてきたんだ！
I've lived my life clutching a heart that can't be contained by a label like 'lonely'!

522
00:43:47,117 --> 00:43:48,917
ドッペルもどきが 其処いらに溢れた
Doppelganger-wannabes were overflowing all over the place.

523
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,717
挙句の果ての今日 ライラライライ
At the end of it all, today, lai-la-lai-lai.

524
00:43:50,817 --> 00:43:52,617
心失きそれを 生み出した奴等は
The ones who gave birth to that heartless thing...

525
00:43:52,617 --> 00:43:54,417
見切りをつけてもう バイバイバイバイ
I've given up on them already, bye-bye-bye-bye.

526
00:43:54,517 --> 00:43:56,317
残されたあたしが この場所で今でも
The me that was left behind, even now in this place...

527
00:43:56,317 --> 00:43:59,117
涙を堪えてるの 如何して 如何して
Why am I holding back tears? Why? Why?

528
00:43:59,217 --> 00:44:01,117
あたしは知ってるわ この場所はいつでも
I know that this place is always...

529
00:44:01,117 --> 00:44:04,117
あなたに守られてきたってこと！
...the fact that I've been protected by you!

530
00:44:04,317 --> 00:44:08,117
痛みなどあまりにも慣れてしまった
I've grown far too used to things like pain.

531
00:44:08,117 --> 00:44:12,817
何千回と巡らせ続けた 喜怒哀楽
The emotions I've let circulate thousands of times.

532
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:15,117
失えない喜びがこの世界にあるならば
If there's a joy in this world that can't be lost,

533
00:44:15,117 --> 00:44:17,117
手放すことすら出来ない 哀しみさえあたしは
then even the sadness that I can't even let go of, I...

534
00:44:17,117 --> 00:44:21,117
この心の 中つまはじきに してしまうのか？ それは、いやだ！
...will I end up ostracizing it within this heart? I don't want that!

535
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:25,617
どうやって この世界を愛せるかな
How can I love this world?

536
00:44:25,617 --> 00:44:29,617
いつだって 転がり続けるんだろう
I'll always just keep on rolling, won't I?

537
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:34,117
ねえ、いっそ 誰も気づかないその想い
Hey, rather, those feelings that no one notices...

538
00:44:34,117 --> 00:44:38,917
この唄で 明かしてみようと思うんだよ
...I think I'll try to reveal them with this song.

539
00:44:39,117 --> 00:44:41,317
あなたなら何を願うか
What would you wish for?

540
00:44:41,317 --> 00:44:43,417
あなたなら何を望むか
What would you desire?

541
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:47,417
軋んだ心が 誰より今を生きてるの
My creaking heart is living for the now more than anyone.

542
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:49,717
あなたには僕が見えるか？
Can you see me?

543
00:44:49,717 --> 00:44:51,917
あなたには僕が見えるか？
Can you see me?

544
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:56,617
それ、あたしの行く末を照らす 灯なんだろう？
That's the light that illuminates my future, isn't it?

545
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:34,329
ねぇ、あしたを叫ぶのなら あたしはここにいるよ
Hey, if you shout for tomorrow, I'm right here

546
00:45:34,729 --> 00:45:38,429
ことばが余りあまれどなお、この夢はつづいてく
Even if words overflow, this dream continues

547
00:45:39,229 --> 00:45:42,929
あたしがあいをかたるのなら そのすべてはこのうただ
If I talk about love, it's all in this song

548
00:45:43,129 --> 00:45:47,929
だれも知らないこのものがたり また口ずさんでしまったみたいだ
This story that no one knows, it seems I've started humming it again

549
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:04,129
握ったメッセージ that's rising hope
Grasped message, that's rising hope

550
00:46:13,329 --> 00:46:17,629
揺るがない世界 非情な現状 続く壁は何重層？
Unwavering world, heartless reality, how many layers are the continuing walls?

551
00:46:18,229 --> 00:46:22,429
イメージ通りなんかいかないし 静かに騒ぎだした本能
It doesn't go as imagined, and my instincts have quietly started to stir

552
00:46:23,129 --> 00:46:27,629
迷路みたい 行き止まりなんだ もう思考はディストーション
Like a maze, it's a dead end, my thoughts are already distorted

553
00:46:28,229 --> 00:46:32,529
容赦ないね いつの間に 見失ったルート、暴れだす
Relentless, isn't it? Before I knew it, I lost the route, starting to run wild

554
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:33,529
(pay attention!)

555
00:46:33,629 --> 00:46:34,929
Hey what is it?

556
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:36,329
(watch your step now!)

557
00:46:36,529 --> 00:46:37,929
常識なんか要らない
I don't need common sense

558
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:39,329
(are you serious!?)

559
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,129
no no no, don't worry 1,2,3

560
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:43,929
吹き返す 心臓のリズム
Breathing back, the rhythm of the heart

561
00:46:44,129 --> 00:46:48,429
視界まだ眩んでる それでも行かなくちゃ
Visibility is still blurred, but I still have to go

562
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:54,129
キミが信じてる僕を 裏切るわけにいかない
I can't betray the 'me' that you believe in

563
00:46:56,529 --> 00:46:58,329
強くクラクションが鳴る
A loud horn sounds

564
00:46:58,529 --> 00:47:03,629
孤独なまま時が経ったって 逃げる事覚えたって
Even if time passed while being lonely, even if I learned how to run away

565
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:06,929
新しい今日が来ちゃうけど
A new today will still come

566
00:47:07,229 --> 00:47:08,429
(feeling bad magic?)

567
00:47:08,529 --> 00:47:13,729
この願い 例え魔法が無くなったって 叶えなきゃ、誓った
This wish, even if magic is gone, I have to fulfill it, I swore

568
00:47:13,929 --> 00:47:19,529
僕はキミと まだ見ぬ未来 あるんだよ 泣きそうでも
I have a future with you that we haven't seen yet, even if I'm about to cry

569
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:23,729
悔しくても止まっていられない
Even if it's frustrating, I can't stay stopped

570
00:47:23,929 --> 00:47:27,629
握ったメッセージ that's rising hope
Grasped message, that's rising hope

571
00:47:30,429 --> 00:47:31,629
rising hope yeah

572
00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:44,129
デモ・ケドnonstepでガンガン迫るhard way
But-however, the hard way approaches relentlessly and nonstop

573
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:45,429
(where's the solution!?)

574
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,429
打ちのめされても get up!
Even if you're knocked down, get up!

575
00:47:47,529 --> 00:47:48,929
(and hurry up!)

576
00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:51,929
そんな損な時間ならすぐさまゴミ箱
If it's such a wasteful time, put it in the trash right away

577
00:47:52,029 --> 00:47:56,629
後悔なんて塵埃同然 さあ 2 step OK shouting OK 欲張りあそばせ
Regrets are just like dust. Now, 2 step OK, shouting OK, be as greedy as you like

578
00:47:56,829 --> 00:48:02,629
可否も賛否も全部僕のもの 飛ばせ 心臓のアルゴリズム
Whether it's right or wrong, approval or disapproval, it's all mine. Let it fly, the algorithm of the heart

579
00:48:03,229 --> 00:48:06,629
ほら 守りたいんだって 僕の声が伝播した
See, 'I want to protect you,' my voice has propagated

580
00:48:06,929 --> 00:48:13,129
異論反論は許すと この想いは不用意に科学できないでしょう？
Allowing objections and counterarguments, this feeling cannot be easily explained by science, right?

581
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:35,429
聞いてよ 辿り着いた正解 言わなくちゃ
Listen, the answer I arrived at, I have to say it

582
00:48:35,629 --> 00:48:41,129
キミがくれる想いの全部を信じていける
I can believe in all the feelings you give me

583
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:46,629
それが嘘かどうかなんて わからなくてもいい
It doesn't matter if it's a lie or not

584
00:48:48,629 --> 00:48:53,729
誰かが示す見本ってなんだっけ 普通の愛って何だっけ
What was that example someone showed? What was 'normal love' again?

585
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:57,729
僕は今日も僕に問いかける
I ask myself again today

586
00:48:57,929 --> 00:49:03,529
問いかける度 手に入れるのは 変わらない真実
Every time I ask, what I get is the unchanging truth

587
00:49:03,729 --> 00:49:06,929
「僕は要らない まだ見たい未来があるから」
'I don't need it, because there's a future I still want to see'

588
00:49:07,229 --> 00:49:12,729
孤独なんかは消えて無くなって 逃げる事嫌になって
Solitude disappears and is gone, I grew to hate running away

589
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:16,129
新しい今日を探すんだよ
I'm searching for a new today

590
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:17,529
(feeling bad magic?)

591
00:49:17,629 --> 00:49:21,929
この願い 例え魔法が無くなったって 叶えなきゃ、誓った
This wish, even if magic is gone, I have to fulfill it, I swore

592
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:25,929
僕とキミで 創れる未来ならもう近い
The future we can create together is already near

593
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:31,629
僕の右手 キミの左手 そっと繋いで
My right hand, your left hand, gently holding them

594
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:37,429
握ったメッセージ that's rising hope
Grasped message, that's rising hope

595
00:49:37,929 --> 00:49:42,629
離さないから that's rising hope
I won't let go, that's rising hope

596
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:47,629
rising hope

597
00:50:09,391 --> 00:50:11,991
歌を歌うことを、諦めようと思ったときがありました。
There was a time when I thought about giving up on singing.

598
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:16,991
思ったように歌えず、苦しい時もたくさんあります。
There are many painful times when I can't sing as I'd like.

599
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:18,591
でも、
But,

600
00:50:18,991 --> 00:50:20,491
それでも、
Even so,

601
00:50:20,991 --> 00:50:23,391
僕が歌を歌うのは、
The reason I sing is...

602
00:50:23,991 --> 00:50:26,891
みんなが応援してくれるからです。
...because everyone supports me.

603
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,391
これから先も頑張っていくから、
I'll keep doing my best from now on, too,

604
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:33,491
ずっとそばで見守っていてください。
so please keep watching over me by my side.

605
00:50:34,091 --> 00:50:35,891
それでは、聞いてください。
Now, please listen.

606
00:50:36,091 --> 00:50:37,591

610
00:50:54,766 --> 00:50:58,366

613
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:14,366
NG無しで体当たり挑戦
Taking on challenges without saying no

614
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:20,666
エゴサで見つけたアンチのコメ「ふざけんな」…誰より分かってるし
Found anti-comments through ego-searching "Don't mess around"... I know better than anyone

615
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:25,666
でも大丈夫ここに立てばみんながいる
But it's okay, if I stand here, everyone is here

楽しいのに泣きそうだよ
Even though it's fun, I feel like crying

662
00:55:08,976 --> 00:55:12,903
優しく鐘の音鳴って
Gently the sound of bells rings out

663
00:55:14,528 --> 00:55:18,573
永久にじゃれあいたいな
I want to play around for eternity

664
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:24,103
鳥籠いらない そんな
I don't need a birdcage, to such a...

665
00:55:24,163 --> 00:55:26,883
理想に満ちた此処へ
...place filled with ideals

666
00:55:27,883 --> 00:55:30,465
君を連れ出せたなら
If I could take you out there

667
00:55:31,298 --> 00:55:34,615
ねぇ 羽の色も 髪の色も
Hey, the color of your wings and hair...

668
00:55:34,615 --> 00:55:37,218
違ってそれぞれ綺麗
...are different and beautiful in their own way

669
00:55:37,565 --> 00:55:41,985
傷付かないように包み込もう
I'll wrap you up so you don't get hurt

670
00:55:42,999 --> 00:55:46,486
護ってたら護られてた
I was protecting you, but I was being protected

君へのこの讃歌
This hymn for you

Familia, heal me, playful happiness

675
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:07,647

Snuggling together, with destiny covering the pain

676
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:13,000
ファミリア 誰にも 見せない表情を
Familia, an expression I show to no one else

677
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:18,565

Quietly from behind my wings, just for me

It's okay to show your weakness

680
00:56:47,006 --> 00:56:50,991
辛さ押し付けていいよ
It's okay to push your pain onto me

681
00:56:52,392 --> 00:56:58,894
たとえ離れたとしても 空からの使いだから
Even if we're apart, I'm a messenger from the sky

682
00:56:59,244 --> 00:57:02,995
君を見守れるんだ
So I can watch over you

683
00:57:04,346 --> 00:57:10,064
ねぇ 出会えたこと 笑えたこと その先で報われて
Hey, that we met and laughed, may we be rewarded

684
00:57:10,198 --> 00:57:13,849
幸せさらに重ね合わそう
Let's layer more happiness together

685
00:57:14,449 --> 00:57:20,301
大切なものがある聖域 役目を刻み込んで
Engraving our roles into this precious sanctuary

Surely to no one, surely I won't give it up

白く広げ
Spreading white

688

白く羽ばたく
Flapping white wings

689
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:43,153
白く 白く
White, white...

690
00:57:52,742 --> 00:57:57,644

Snuggling together, with destiny covering the pain

692
00:58:05,196 --> 00:58:10,098

Familia, an expression I show to no one else

決めつけて一直線
Decide and go straight ahead

718
01:00:14,165 --> 01:00:16,965
つまり企んだら発射オーライだ！
In other words, if you've got a plan, blast off—all right!

721
01:00:30,965 --> 01:00:33,365
まだ楽器の結婚は立ち直っていません！
I still haven't recovered from the "instrument marriage"!

722
01:00:33,565 --> 01:00:36,765
2年目の目標は、ハイ・アップがついたオリジナル曲を出すこと！
My goal for the second year is to release an original song with "High Up"!

723
01:00:37,465 --> 01:00:40,565
「何だよそんなこと言っちゃダメだ、おバカ」
"What are you saying? You shouldn't say such things, you dummy."

724
01:00:41,365 --> 01:00:43,265
「うわ〜すごい！ ありがと〜」
"Wow, amazing! Thank you~"

725
01:00:44,165 --> 01:00:45,765
日々これ騒然で go my way!
Every day is tumultuous, so go my way!

726
01:00:46,165 --> 01:00:49,665
虎視眈々でいたいんだもん だって意気ガンガンがいいんだもん
I want to keep a sharp eye out, because I want to be full of spirit

727
01:00:50,165 --> 01:00:53,765
全方位にガッツリ アンテナ張っていなくちゃ！
I've got to keep my antennae fully up in all directions!

728
01:00:54,365 --> 01:00:58,365
いつでも心はちゃんと忠誠でいたいな
I always want my heart to be properly loyal

729
01:00:58,965 --> 01:01:03,565
好奇心は絶えず熱心でいたいなって
I want my curiosity to be constantly enthusiastic

730
01:01:04,165 --> 01:01:08,565
言い聞かせるんだ 調子に乗ったら
I'll tell myself that if I get carried away

731
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,565
すぐ飽きられちゃうから あー！
People will soon get tired of me!

732
01:01:11,965 --> 01:01:15,665
タイトロープもどんとこいでっせ
Bring on the tightrope walk too

733
01:01:16,165 --> 01:01:19,565
すなわち特者生存ワンダラダー！！
Which is to say, it's a "Special-Person-Survival Wonderland"!!

734
01:01:19,965 --> 01:01:21,565
しがみつけ
Hold on tight!

735
01:01:21,965 --> 01:01:26,665
“努力とは最後まで諦めないこと”
“Effort means not giving up until the very end”

736
01:01:26,965 --> 01:01:28,165
メモっておいて！
Take a note of that!

737
01:01:28,565 --> 01:01:32,565
ホントは baby 自信なんかがないよ
To be honest, baby, I have no confidence

738
01:01:32,965 --> 01:01:36,565
ホントは baby 不安ばっかで泣きそうだ
To be honest, baby, I'm full of anxiety and about to cry

739
01:01:36,965 --> 01:01:40,765
でもね baby 挫けないって決めたの
But you see, baby, I've decided not to give up

740
01:01:41,165 --> 01:01:48,665
だから baby 挑戦したいよ 未開の天地 無限のフィールドで！
So, baby, I want to take on the challenge in uncharted territory, an infinite field!

741
01:01:48,965 --> 01:01:49,965
行くぞ！
Here I go!

742
01:02:00,165 --> 01:02:04,365
前進上等！ ちゃんと歓迎して 高まれ
Moving forward is fine! Please welcome me properly and get pumped up

743
01:02:04,965 --> 01:02:09,665
海空創造 ちゃんと驚喜して 興奮しよう
Creating sea and sky, let's be properly overjoyed and get excited

744
01:02:10,165 --> 01:02:13,765
僕が言うんだもん 本当にするんだもん
Because I say so, I'm really going to do it

745
01:02:14,165 --> 01:02:17,765
現実超えろ未来 あー！
Surpass reality, the future, ah!

746
01:02:18,165 --> 01:02:20,765
弱点も平気 シンデレラじゃない
I'm fine with weaknesses, I'm no Cinderella

747
01:02:21,165 --> 01:02:24,565
すなわち特者生存ワンダラダー！！
Which is to say, it's a "Special-Person-Survival Wonderland"!!

748
01:02:24,965 --> 01:02:26,765
楽しもう
Let's enjoy it!

749
01:02:27,165 --> 01:02:31,365
面白がれること探し放題でっせ
There are endless interesting things to find

750
01:02:31,965 --> 01:02:35,565
無限のフィールドで
In an infinite field

751
01:02:35,965 --> 01:02:37,565
パニックしなくてもいけ
You don't have to panic

752
01:02:37,965 --> 01:02:39,765
ど真ん中一直線
Go straight through the middle

753
01:02:40,165 --> 01:02:42,665
つまりこれが僕の答えなんだ
In short, this is my answer

754
01:02:43,165 --> 01:02:45,965
胸を張れ！ 今を生きるぞその意味を
Hold your head high! Live in the now, and its meaning

755
01:02:46,365 --> 01:02:49,365
明くる日も明くる日も確かめ進め！
Day after day, confirm it and move forward!

756
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:50,665
行くぞ！
Here I go!

757
01:03:01,165 --> 01:03:03,665
ありがとー！
