空と大地が交差している
The sky and the earth are intersecting

5
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,946
今たたずんでるこの世界で
In this world I'm standing in right now

6
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,840
命が生まれ　また沈んでく
Life is born and then sinks away again

7
00:02:07,032 --> 00:02:10,519
繰り返される営みの中
In the midst of repeated activities

8
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:13,435
こんなもんかとよぎった瞬間
The moment I thought, "Is this all there is?"

9
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:17,291
夢は力をなくす
Dreams lose their power

10
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:21,948
もう一度生まれよ　この場所で
Be born once again in this place

11
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:29,317
正義のその奥で夢が息づいてる
Deep within justice, a dream is breathing

12
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,243
重なる力を信じて
Believe in the overlapping power

13
00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:37,009
正義のその奥に闇が潜んでいる
Deep within justice, darkness is lurking

14
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,482
見極めろすべてを
See through it all

15
00:02:40,675 --> 00:02:44,295
振り上げた勇気は切り裂くためじゃない
The courage you've brandished isn't meant for tearing apart

16
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:47,330
引き合う絆で
With the bonds that pull us together

17
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,518
呼び覚ませ
Awaken it

18
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,437
鮮やかに
Vividly

19
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,000
ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

20
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:04,538
傷ついて行き場をなくし
Wounded and with nowhere to go

21
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,514
さまよっているその魂を
That soul which is wandering

22
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,333
癒やす力は心の奥で
The power to heal is deep within the heart

23
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,827
静かに鼓動を刻んでいる
Quietly keeping a pulse

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,494
持てる力すべてぶつけ
Hit it with all the power you have

25
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,990
涙を流すのなら
If you're going to shed tears

26
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,932
選ぶべき道は君を待ってる
The path you should choose is waiting for you

27
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,309
失った今と通り過ぎた過去
The lost present and the past that has gone by

28
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,455
狭間であきらめるよりも
Rather than giving up in the gap between them

29
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,339
今日を目をそらさずにここから始めよう
Let's not look away from today and start from here

見極めろ明日を
See through to tomorrow

31
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,027
誰かに見せつける勇気は脱ぎ捨てて
Discard the courage that's just for show

32
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,541
素顔に戻ろう
Let's return to our true faces

33
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,518

00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,670

Awaken it

43
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,800
鮮やかに
Vividly

46
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:44,748

So, we have guests today. Ta-da! It's the Uppao!

53
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:15,548
みなさん知ってますか？ウッパオという存在を。
Do you all know? About the existence of Uppao.

54
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:21,548
平民じゃなきゃね、ちょっと認知度が低く、あんまりグッズも売れてないんですけれども。
If you're not a Heimin, their recognition is a bit low, and their goods aren't selling that well either...

55
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:25,548
そんなこと言ったらみんなに愛されるキャラになりました！よかったね、ウッパオ。
But having said that, they've become characters loved by everyone! Good for you, Uppao.

56
00:06:26,048 --> 00:06:29,548
ウッパ役もやっていきつつ、えー、本日頑張っていこうと思います。
While also playing the role of Uppa, I'll do my best today.

57
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:32,048
たくさんのウッパオに囲まれて歌っていきます。
I'll be singing surrounded by many Uppao.

58
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:36,048
それでは早速、次の曲参りましょう。いくぞー！
Now then, let's move on to the next song right away. Let's go!

59
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:53,548
みんなー！もっともっと盛り上がれますかー！？
Everyone! Can you get even more hyped!?

60
00:06:54,048 --> 00:07:00,548
早速、もうゲストが登場します！トップバッターは不知火フレア！

放て！心に刻んだ夢を
Unleash! The dream engraved in my heart

62
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:08,048
未来さえ置き去りにして
Leaving even the future behind

63
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:11,548
限界など知らない 意味無い
Knowing no limits, it's meaningless

64
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:15,048
この力が光散らす
This power scatters the light

65
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:20,548
その先に遥かな想いを
Sending my distant feelings beyond it

66
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:25,048
歩いてきたこの道を
This path that I've walked down,

67
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:28,548
振り返ることしか
if all I can do

68
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,548
出来ないなら 今ここで
is look back, then right here and now,

69
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:35,048
全てを壊せる
I can destroy everything

70
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:38,748
暗闇に落ちる街並み
The cityscape falling into darkness,

71
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:42,048
人はどこまで立ち向かえるの？
how far can people stand against it?

72
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:45,548
加速するその痛みから
From that accelerating pain,

73
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:49,348
誰かをきっと守れるよ
I can surely protect someone

74
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:54,548

Right now, through my whole body at the speed of light,

76
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:03,748
駆け巡った確かな予感
a certain premonition raced through me

77
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:07,048
掴め！望むものなら残さず
Seize it! If it's what you want, leave nothing behind

78
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:10,548
輝ける自分らしさで
with a radiance that is true to yourself

79
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:14,048
信じてるよあの日の誓いを
I believe in the vow of that day

80
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:17,548
この瞳に光る涙
The tears shining in these eyes

81
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:22,548
それさえも強さになるから
even they will become my strength

82
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:27,748
立ち止まると 少しだけ
When I stop for a moment,

83
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:31,048
感じる切なさに
the sadness that I feel,

84
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:34,348
戸惑う事無いなんて
I won't lie and say

85
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:37,548
嘘はつかないよ
it doesn't bewilder me

86
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:41,048
空に舞うコインが描く
The trajectory of the coin dancing in the sky

87
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:44,548
放物線が決める運命
is the parabola that decides my fate

88
00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:48,048
打ち出した答えが今日も
The answer I've sent out today,

89
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:51,548
私の胸を駆け巡る
too, is racing through my chest

90
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:57,048
Sparking! The shiny lights awake true desire only my RAILGUN

91
00:08:57,548 --> 00:09:02,548
必ず 貫いてく 戸惑うことなく
I will surely pierce through, without any hesitation

92
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:05,748
傷ついても 走り続ける
Even if I get hurt, I'll keep on running

93
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:09,048
凛と煌めく視線は
My dignified and sparkling gaze

94
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,748
狂いなく闇を切り裂く
cuts through the darkness without error

95
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:15,348
迷いなんて吹き飛ばせばいい
I should just blow away any doubts

96
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:18,748
この心が叫ぶ限り
as long as this heart of mine screams out

97
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:24,048
誰ひとり邪魔などさせない
I won't let a single person get in my way

98
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:55,548
儚く舞う無数の願いは
The countless fleetingly dancing wishes

99
00:09:55,548 --> 00:09:59,048
この両手に積もってゆく
accumulate in these hands of mine

100
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:02,348
切り裂く闇に見えてくるのは...
What becomes visible in the piercing darkness...

101
00:10:02,763 --> 00:10:03,963
...浮かす
...lifting

102
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:06,263
切ない記憶
Painful memories

103
00:10:06,263 --> 00:10:08,163
色褪せてく現実に揺れる
Swaying in a fading reality

104
00:10:08,163 --> 00:10:12,763
絶望には負けたくない
I don't want to lose to despair

105
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:15,963
私が今私であること
That I am who I am right now

106
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:18,263
胸を張って
Holding my head high

107
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:20,063
全て誇れる！
I can be proud of everything!

108
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:22,163
Looking! The blitz loop this planet to search my way

109
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,563
Only my Railgun can shoot it 今すぐ

街に飛び交う笑い声も
Even the laughter echoing through the city

120
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:20,363
見て見ぬフリしてるだけの作りもんさ
Is just a fabrication that everyone ignores

121
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:21,263
気が触れそうだ
It's enough to drive me mad

122
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,663
クラクラするほどの良い匂いが
A scent so good it makes me dizzy

123
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:26,763
ツンと刺した鼻の奥 目を覚ます
Pierces deep into my nose and wakes me up

124
00:11:26,763 --> 00:11:30,263
本能のまま今日は誰の番だ
Following instinct, whose turn is it today?

125
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:32,263
この世界で
In this world

126
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:34,863
何かができるのか 僕には
What can I do? For me...

127
00:11:34,863 --> 00:11:37,563
何ができるのか
...what can I do?

128
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,963
ただその真っ黒な目から
I just don't want tears to fall...

129
00:11:40,963 --> 00:11:43,563
涙こぼれ落ちないように
...from those pitch-black eyes

130
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:46,463
願う 未来に何度でもずっと
I pray, forever and ever into the future

131
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:49,063
喰らいつく
I'll keep hanging on

132
00:11:49,063 --> 00:11:51,763
この間違いだらけの世界の中
Inside this world full of mistakes

133
00:11:51,763 --> 00:11:55,163
君には笑ってほしいから
I want you to be able to smile

134
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:57,563
もう誰も傷つけない
I won't let anyone get hurt anymore

135
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:59,863
強く強くなりたいんだよ
I want to become strong, so strong

136
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:03,363
僕が僕でいられるように
So that I can remain myself

137
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:14,463
素晴らしき世界は今日も安泰
This wonderful world is peaceful again today

138
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,263
街に渦巻く悪い話も
Even the bad rumors swirling in the city

139
00:12:17,263 --> 00:12:21,563
知らない知らないフリして目を逸らした
I looked away, pretending I didn't know

140
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:23,363
正気の沙汰じゃないな
This is sheer madness

141
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:26,463
真面目に着飾った行進
A march dressed up in sincerity

142
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:29,063
鳴らす足音が弾む 行き先は
The sound of footsteps bounces, the destination...

143
00:12:29,063 --> 00:12:32,363
消えない消えない味が染み付いている
...is stained with an indelible taste

144
00:12:32,363 --> 00:12:34,663
裏側の世界
The world on the other side

145
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:22,163
今日も答えのない世界の中で願ってるんだよ
In this world without answers, I'm praying today too

146
00:13:22,163 --> 00:13:25,263
不器用だけれど
Clumsy as I am

147
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:30,863
いつまでも君とただ笑っていたいから
Because I just want to laugh with you forever

148
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:33,763
跳ねる心臓が体揺らし
My pounding heart shakes my body

149
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:36,163
叫ぶんだよ
And it's screaming

150
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:39,263
今こそ動き出せ
Now is the time to start moving

151
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:41,863
弱い自分を何度でもずっと
Over and over again, my weak self...

152
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,563
喰らいつく
...will keep hanging on

153
00:13:44,563 --> 00:13:47,263
この間違いだらけの世界の中
Inside this world full of mistakes

154
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:50,563
君には笑ってほしいから
I want you to be able to smile

155
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,163
もう誰も泣かないよう
So that no one has to cry anymore

156
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:55,663
強く強くなりたいんだよ
I want to become strong, so strong

157
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:59,263
僕が僕でいられるように
So that I can remain myself

158
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:13,263
ただ君を守るそのために
Just for the sake of protecting you

159
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:15,963
走る 走る 走るんだよ
I'll run, run, run

160
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:19,263
僕の中の僕を超える
To surpass the me inside of me

161
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:54,263
まるで御伽の話
Just like a fairy tale

162
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:56,763
終わり迎えた証
A sign that it's come to an end

163
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,263
長すぎる旅路から
From a journey that was far too long

164
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:01,263
切り出した一節
A passage cut out

165
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:05,463
それはかつてこの地に影を落とした悪を
The memories of the short journey with the hero

166
00:15:05,553 --> 00:15:09,388
撃ち取りし勇者との短い旅の記憶
who defeated the evil that once cast a shadow over this land.

167
00:15:09,438 --> 00:15:15,638
勇者
作詞・作曲：Ayase
The Brave
Lyrics & Composition: Ayase

168
00:15:21,038 --> 00:15:25,038
物語は終わり 勇者は眠りにつく
The story ends, and the hero goes to sleep,

169
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:29,538
穏やかな日常をこの地に残して
leaving a peaceful daily life in this land.

170
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:34,038
時の流れは無情に人を忘れさせる
The passage of time heartlessly makes people forget,

171
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:38,538
そこに生きた軌跡も錆び付いていく
and the traces of life there begin to rust away.

172
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:43,138
それでも君の言葉も願いも勇気も
Even so, your words, your wishes, and your courage

173
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:47,938
今も確かに私の中で生きている
are still certainly living within me today.

174
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:53,138
同じ道を選んだそれだけだったはずなのに
It should have been just that we chose the same path,

175
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:55,738
いつの間にかどうして
but before I knew it, why...

176
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:59,638
頬を伝う涙の理由をもっと知りたいんだ
...do I want to know more about why tears run down my cheeks?

177
00:16:00,038 --> 00:16:03,838
今更だって共に歩んだ旅路を辿れば
Even if it's too late, if I trace back the journey we walked together,

178
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:08,438
そこに君は居なくともきっと見つけられる
even if you aren't there, I'm sure I can find it.

179
00:16:18,438 --> 00:16:22,638
物語は続く一人の旅路へと発つ
The story continues as I set out on a solo journey,

180
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:27,638
立ち寄る街で出会う人の記憶の中に残る君は
remaining in the memories of the people I meet in the towns I visit.

181
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:32,138
相も変わらずお人好しで格好つけてばかりだね
You're still as soft-hearted and showing off as ever, aren't you?

182
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:36,438
あちらこちらに作ったシンボルは勝ち取った平和の証
The symbols we built here and there are proof of the peace we won.

183
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:40,638
それすら未来でいつか私が一人にならないように
Even those were left as markers so that I won't be alone in the future,

184
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:45,138
あの旅を思い出せるように残された目印
so that I can remember that journey.

185
00:16:55,238 --> 00:16:59,438
まるで御伽の話終わり迎えた証
Just like a fairy tale, proof of reaching the end.

186
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:04,638
私を変えた出会い百分の一の旅路
The encounter that changed me, a journey of one percent.

187
00:17:05,238 --> 00:17:07,938
君の勇気をいつか風がさらって
Even if the wind sweeps away your courage one day,

188
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:10,838
誰の記憶から消えてしまっても
and it vanishes from everyone's memory,

189
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:14,838
私が未来に連れていくから
I will carry it with me into the future.

190
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:17,938
君の手を取ったあの日全て始まった
Everything began that day when I took your hand.

191
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:21,438
くだらなくて思わずふっと笑ってしまうような
The trivial moments that make me break into a smile,

192
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:25,038
ありふれた時間が今も眩しい
those ordinary times are still dazzling now.

193
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:30,338
知りたいんだ今更だって振り返るとそこにはいつでも
I want to know, even now, because whenever I look back,

194
00:17:30,538 --> 00:17:35,638
優しく微笑みかける君がいるから
you are always there, smiling gently at me.

195
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:47,138
新たな旅の始まりは
The start of a new journey

196
00:17:47,438 --> 00:17:49,838
君が守り抜いたこの地に
in this land that you protected,

197
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:52,838
芽吹いた命と
along with the life

198
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,838
共に
that has budded here.

199
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:35,638
そばかす
作詞：YUKI　作曲：恩田快人
Sobakasu (Freckles)
Lyrics: YUKI, Composition: Yoshihito Onda

200
00:18:38,438 --> 00:18:41,838
大キライだったそばかすをちょっと
I'd touch the freckles I hated so much,

201
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:44,538
ひとなでしてタメ息をひとつ
and let out a little sigh.

202
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:47,838
ヘヴィー級の恋は見事に
That heavyweight love

203
00:18:47,938 --> 00:18:50,238
角砂糖と一緒に溶けた
melted away perfectly, just like a sugar cube.

204
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,538
前よりももっとやせた胸にちょっと
The thorn that prickles

205
00:18:53,738 --> 00:18:56,638
チクっとささるトゲが痛い
my chest, now thinner than before, hurts a bit.

206
00:18:56,838 --> 00:19:00,638
星占いもあてにならないわ
I can't even rely on horoscopes anymore.

207
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:12,638
もっと遠くまで一緒にゆけたら
If only we could have gone much further together...

208
00:19:14,438 --> 00:19:15,438
ねぇ
Hey,

209
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:19,638
うれしくてそれだけで
I'd be happy just with that.

210
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:27,138
想い出はいつもキレイだけど
Memories are always beautiful, but

211
00:19:28,138 --> 00:19:32,138
それだけじゃおなかがすくわ
that alone isn't enough to satisfy me.

212
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:38,838
本当はせつない夜なのに
Even though it's actually a painful night,

213
00:19:39,438 --> 00:19:42,138
どうしてかしら？
I wonder why?

214
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:45,638
あの人の笑顔も
I can't even remember

215
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:49,638
思い出せないの
that person's smile.

216
00:20:05,146 --> 00:20:10,246
それがあたしの性格だから
Because that's just my personality.

217
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:13,846
もどかしい気持ちで
With these irritating feelings,

218
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,646
あやふやなままで
Remaining so vague,

219
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:23,546
それでもいい 恋をしてきた
But even so, I've been in love.

220
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:29,046
おもいきりあけた
I opened it wide,

221
00:20:29,546 --> 00:20:34,546
左耳のピアスには
In the piercing on my left ear.

222
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:41,646
ねえ 笑えないエピソード
Hey, there's a story I can't laugh about.

223
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:52,546
そばかすの数を数えてみる
I try counting my freckles,

224
00:20:52,946 --> 00:20:58,046
汚れたぬいぐるみ抱いてる
Holding onto a dirty stuffed animal.

225
00:20:58,746 --> 00:21:04,446
胸を刺すトゲは消えないけど
The thorn pricking my heart won't go away, but...

226
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:09,046
カエルちゃんも ウサギちゃんも
Froggy and Bunny,

227
00:21:09,646 --> 00:21:15,646
笑ってくれるの
Both smile for me.

228
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:25,046
想い出はいつも キレイだけど
Memories are always beautiful, but...

229
00:21:25,546 --> 00:21:30,046
それだけじゃ おなかがすくの
That alone just makes me hungry.

230
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:36,346
本当は せつない夜なのに
Truth is, even on such a painful night,

231
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:42,346
どうしてかしら あの人の涙を
Why is it, I wonder? His tears...

232
00:21:42,846 --> 00:21:47,346
思い出せないの
I can't remember them.

233
00:21:47,946 --> 00:21:52,446
思い出せないの
I can't remember them.

234
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:09,946
どうしてなの?
Why is it?

235
00:23:40,746 --> 00:23:43,746
Shangri-La

236
00:23:52,946 --> 00:23:55,946
流れに身を任せ
Leaving ourselves to the flow,

237
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:59,046
いつか大人になってゆく
We eventually become adults.

238
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:04,546
少しずつ汚れてゆく事なの?
Does that mean we slowly become tainted?

239
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:10,446
熟した果実だけ選ばれて
Only the ripe fruits are chosen,

240
00:24:11,446 --> 00:24:18,646
ナイフで裂かれて 飲み込まれる前に
Before being cut by a knife and swallowed whole.

241
00:24:19,146 --> 00:24:22,946
僕等目指した Shangri-La
The Shangri-La we aimed for,

242
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,846
欲望は抑えきれずに
Unable to suppress our desires,

243
00:24:26,146 --> 00:24:32,346
空想にまみれた 自由を求め続けた
Covered in daydreams, we kept seeking freedom.

244
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:38,946
今なら言えるだろう 此処が理想郷さ
Now I can say it, this is the utopia.

245
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:44,946
さよなら 蒼き日々よ
Farewell, those youthful days.

246
00:24:54,146 --> 00:25:04,146
大切な何かを 踏み台にまでしても
Even if we have to step on something precious...

247
00:25:00,594 --> 00:25:05,928
一番高い林檎　掴みたかった
I wanted to grab the highest apple

248
00:25:06,394 --> 00:25:12,394
失くしてから気付く　尊いモノ
Realizing its value only after losing it

249
00:25:12,894 --> 00:25:19,394
幼い僕等は　的外れだらけさ
We were young and filled with irrelevance

250
00:25:20,594 --> 00:25:24,328
満ち足りた日々の制圧は
The suppression of fulfilled days

251
00:25:24,594 --> 00:25:27,528
情緒不安定になる
Becomes emotionally unstable

252
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:30,594
傷を負ってでも
Even with wounds

253
00:25:30,794 --> 00:25:33,994
羽ばたきたいと願うよ
I wish to fly

254
00:25:34,394 --> 00:25:36,861
愚かでいいのだろう
It's okay to be foolish

255
00:25:37,094 --> 00:25:40,061
見渡す夢の跡
The traces of dreams as far as the eye can see

256
00:25:40,394 --> 00:25:45,394
さよなら　蒼き日々よ
Goodbye, blue days

257
00:26:14,394 --> 00:26:21,061
輝く空は　無邪気そう装い
The shining sky pretends to be innocent

258
00:26:21,394 --> 00:26:26,394
落陽を待ち伏せしていた
Lurking in wait for the sunset

259
00:26:31,394 --> 00:26:34,794
僕等は目指した Shangri-La
We aimed for Shangri-La

260
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:38,328
欲望は抑えきれずに
Unable to suppress our desires

261
00:26:38,794 --> 00:26:41,794
空想にまみれた
Covered in fantasies

262
00:26:42,094 --> 00:26:44,728
自由を求め続けた
Continuing to seek freedom

263
00:26:44,794 --> 00:26:47,928
距離をおいてこそ
Only by keeping distance

264
00:26:48,094 --> 00:26:51,128
自分の大きさを知る
Do you realize your own size

265
00:26:51,394 --> 00:26:54,328
未熟な心は
An immature heart

266
00:26:54,594 --> 00:26:57,394
それさえ分からないまま
Without even understanding that

267
00:26:57,794 --> 00:27:00,661
今なら言えるだろう
Now I can say it

268
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:03,861
此処がそう楽園さ
This place is paradise

269
00:27:04,094 --> 00:27:09,094
さよなら　蒼き日々よ
Goodbye, blue days

270
00:27:58,394 --> 00:28:10,594
遥か空響いてる　祈りは奇跡に
Resonating in the distant sky, a prayer becomes a miracle

271
00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:13,594
ETERNAL BLAZE

272
00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:18,094
このライブも、もう折り返しに来てます！
This live is already halfway through!

273
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:23,094
みんな、まだまだ、まだまだ盛り上がっていけるよね！
Everyone, we can still, still, still get more hyped, right!

274
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:28,261
真夜中の蒼に溶けて
Melting into the midnight blue

275
00:28:28,594 --> 00:28:31,394
流れてく涙の粒
Streaming drops of tears

276
00:28:31,594 --> 00:28:37,394
迷いなく包み込むぬくもりに出会った
I met a warmth that envelops without hesitation

277
00:28:38,094 --> 00:28:43,394
真っ白な雪のようにどこまでも素直な言葉
Words as honest as pure white snow

278
00:28:43,794 --> 00:28:49,594
鉄の羽纏った僕を動かしてく
They set me in motion, clad in iron wings

279
00:28:50,794 --> 00:28:55,594
傷つくたびに優しくなれる
Every time I get hurt, I can become kinder

280
00:28:56,094 --> 00:29:01,094
君のその笑顔だけ守り抜きたい
I want to protect only your smile

281
00:29:01,594 --> 00:29:05,094
願いはひとつ
There is only one wish

282
00:29:05,794 --> 00:29:11,094
時空を越え刻まれた悲しみの記憶
Memories of sadness carved across time and space

283
00:29:11,594 --> 00:29:17,594
まっすぐに受け止める君は光の女神
You, accepting everything head-on, are the goddess of light

284
00:29:18,094 --> 00:29:24,094
あの日胸に灯った永遠の炎
The eternal flame lit in my heart that day

285
00:29:24,594 --> 00:29:32,594
深い闇解き放って自由のトビラ開いてく
Releasing the deep darkness, opening the door to freedom

286
00:29:33,394 --> 00:29:42,094
強く果てない未来へ
Toward a strong and endless future

287
00:29:49,094 --> 00:29:55,394
冷たい緑の月に映し出す心の影
The shadow of the heart reflected on the cold green moon

288
00:29:55,794 --> 00:30:01,594
淋しげに呟いた君の傍にいたい
I want to be by your side, as you whispered lonely

289
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:03,749
真実と向き合うこと
Facing the truth

290
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:06,549
教えてくれた勇気は
The courage you taught me

291
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:10,049
僕を駆け巡って
Rushes through me

292
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:13,649
夢に目覚めてゆく
Awakening to a dream

293
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:16,449
触れ合う気持ち
The feelings that touch

294
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:19,449
離れないように
So they won't drift apart

295
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:22,949
しっかりと抱きしめて
Hold them tight

296
00:30:23,449 --> 00:30:25,349
確かな想い
A certain feeling

297
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:28,649
貫いてゆく
I will see it through

298
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:31,849
銀の海に隠した
Hidden in a silver sea

299
00:30:32,349 --> 00:30:34,749
空白のページ
A blank page

300
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:37,849
君だけが知っている
Only you know

301
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:41,349
「本当」を僕に見せて
Show me the "truth"

302
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:44,549
吹き荒れる切なさに
In the raging sorrow

303
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:47,349
生まれゆく誓い
A vow is born

304
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:50,649
もう何も怖くはないよ
I'm not afraid of anything anymore

305
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,249
結んだ視線
Our locked eyes

306
00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:56,549
そらさずに
Without looking away

307
00:30:57,049 --> 00:31:00,449
大切な今 始める
I start this precious "now"

308
00:31:10,249 --> 00:31:12,249
Eternal Blaze!!

309
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:32,449
自分で
By myself

310
00:31:32,749 --> 00:31:33,849
君で
With you

311
00:31:34,249 --> 00:31:37,249
いられる場所
A place where we can be ourselves

312
00:31:37,949 --> 00:31:40,049
悪夢-まぼろし-に
To a nightmare or phantom

313
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:43,049
さらわれぬように
So we're not snatched away

314
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:45,749
消えない雨の
Of the unending rain

315
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:49,249
苦しみも
The suffering too

316
00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:52,249
鍵を壊して
Break the lock

317
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:55,549
ぶつけてよ
Release it all

318
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:58,549
隣にいるから
Because I'm by your side

319
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:02,949
すべてを信じて
Believe in everything

320
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:08,349
時を越え刻まれた
Etched across time

321
00:32:08,849 --> 00:32:11,349
悲しみの記憶
Memories of sadness

322
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:14,349
まっすぐに受け止める
I'll take them head-on

323
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,349
君は光の女神
You are the goddess of light

324
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:20,349
あの日胸に灯った
That day, lit in my chest

325
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:23,349
永遠の炎
The eternal flame

326
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:25,349
深い闇
Deep darkness

327
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:27,449
解き放って
Set it free

328
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:31,849
自由のトビラ開いてく
Opening the door to freedom

329
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:38,449
強く果てない未来へ
To a strong and endless future

330
00:32:48,449 --> 00:32:53,449
そう きっとここから始まる
Yes, it surely starts from here

00:33:23,749 --> 00:33:25,349
伝説の朝に
On that legendary morning

332
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:28,349

The words we vowed to each other

分かち合う声に
In our shared voices

00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:53,449
この右手と
With this right hand

この左手
And this left hand

343
00:33:55,449 --> 00:33:56,649

重ね合えば
If we overlap them

348
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,349
繋ぎ合えば
If we connect them

349
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:07,249
伝うのか
Will they reach?

350
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:07,249
伝うのか
Will they reach?

351
00:34:07,749 --> 00:34:09,449
運命に委ね
Entrusting to fate

一雫のくちびる
A single drop of lips

431
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,670
塗り直した真夜中
Midnight repainted

432
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:19,370
今夜は来る来ない かわいてゆく
Whether it comes or not tonight, it's drying up

433
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,870
七枚花びらちぎって
Tearing off seven petals

434
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,870
リンドー リンドー
Gentian, gentian

435
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,070

Captive clock

437
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,070
少しハッピー心中
A slightly happy double suicide

438
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,270
すぐに立てるわさ
I can stand up soon

439
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:45,070
笑われ自棄するなら その手で奪って
If you're laughed at and act out of desperation, take it with those hands

00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,870
避難し？
Seeking refuge?

443
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:58,370
アブクジャブジャブ紐切れた
Bubbles splashing, the string broke

444
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:03,370

口説き文句の飛び交い
Seductive phrases flying around

450
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:27,170
私だけわからんと すぐに来て防いで
Saying only I don't understand, come quickly and prevent it

451
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:31,770
タイノタイノ 境界はるばる乗り越え
Tainotaino, crossing boundaries from afar

Opening the heartstrings wide and rattling

457
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,370
甘い前に潤して
Moisten before it gets sweet

458
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,870
来る来ない 狂い 濁れ
Coming or not, go crazy, get muddy

459
00:40:09,151 --> 00:40:13,511
ダッダッダーリナ ダッダッダラーッタッ
Da dda dda rina da dda dda ra tta

460
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:17,911
ダーリノ ダーリノ ダッダラーッタッ
Da rino da rino da dda ra tta

461
00:40:17,911 --> 00:40:22,411
ダーラダッ ダッダッダラーッタッ
Da ra da dda dda dda ra tta

462
00:40:22,411 --> 00:40:24,811
ダーリノ ダーリノ ダーリノ ダーラッ
Da rino da rino da rino da ra

463
00:40:24,811 --> 00:40:26,411
ダラララリラッ
Da ra ra ra ri ra

464
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:28,811
止めどなき感情 吐き出したい
Unstoppable emotions, I want to let them out

465
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:30,511
Back to back to back to back...

466
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:33,211
鼓動が 何時までも 震えていたい
I want my heart to keep trembling forever

467
00:40:34,911 --> 00:40:37,311
愛ゆえ狂う定めならば
If it is our fate to go mad for love

468
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,511
時を超えて交わる
We will meet across time

469
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:47,961
熱く焦がすほど の知れ合いたい
I want to know you so much it burns

470
00:40:47,991 --> 00:40:49,711
Back to back to back to back...

471
00:40:49,761 --> 00:40:52,161
赤い鮮血で 結ばれたい
I want to be bound by red blood

472
00:40:52,211 --> 00:40:54,311
Bye bye bye bye bye bye...

473
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,561
満たさぬ棘を笑わば超えて
If they laugh at the unfulfilled thorns, overcome them

474
00:40:56,611 --> 00:40:58,661
地獄立って相見えて
Meeting even in the depths of hell

475
00:40:58,681 --> 00:41:00,611
重ねた運命の行方
The destination of our overlapping fates

476
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:03,111
比類なき情意で
With unparalleled affection

477
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:05,311
甘い未来など要らぬ
I don't need a sweet future

478
00:41:05,331 --> 00:41:07,611
抱き合いて溺れても
Even if we drown in each other's arms

479
00:41:09,311 --> 00:41:13,511
チッキラン チッキラン チッキラン チッキラン
Chikkiran chikkiran chikkiran chikkiran

480
00:41:13,711 --> 00:41:17,911
チッキラン チッキラン チッキラン チッキラン
Chikkiran chikkiran chikkiran chikkiran

481
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:22,311
チッキラン チッキラン チッキラン チッキラン
Chikkiran chikkiran chikkiran chikkiran

482
00:41:22,461 --> 00:41:24,011
チッキラン チッキラン チッキラン チッキラン
Chikkiran chikkiran chikkiran chikkiran

483
00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:28,711
高嶺ルイちゃんでした！ありがとう！
That was Takane Lui! Thank you!

484
00:41:28,761 --> 00:41:31,111
かなた先輩、お誕生日おめでとうございます！
Kanata-senpai, happy birthday!

485
00:41:31,161 --> 00:41:33,261
一緒に歌えて嬉しかったです。
I was so happy to sing with you.

486
00:41:33,311 --> 00:41:35,011
ありがとう！またね！
Thank you! See you later!

488
00:42:09,911 --> 00:42:11,711
まだ言わないで
Don't say it yet

489
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:13,961
呪文めいたその言葉
Those words like a magic spell

490
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:15,261
「愛」なんて
Something like "love"

491
00:42:15,311 --> 00:42:17,211
羽のように軽い
Is as light as a feather

492
00:42:17,251 --> 00:42:18,491
囁いて
Whisper to me

493
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:20,911
パパより優しい手つきで
With a touch gentler than a father's

494
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:22,411
脱がせて
Take it off

495
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:25,511
覚悟があるのならば
If you have the resolve

496
00:42:27,961 --> 00:42:31,561
百万の薔薇の寝床に
In a bed of a million roses

497
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:35,361
埋もれ見る夢よりも
Rather than the dreams seen buried there

498
00:42:35,411 --> 00:42:39,511
馨しく私は生きてるの
I am living more fragrantly

499
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:44,461
汚れれば
If it becomes defiled

500
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:46,661
醜いものがはびこった この世界
In this world where ugly things have run rampant

501
00:42:48,991 --> 00:42:50,261
汚れずに
Without being defiled

502
00:42:50,311 --> 00:42:54,511
はばたいて行けるのか
Can I keep flying?

503
00:42:56,161 --> 00:42:59,511
ひとり繭の中
Alone inside a cocoon

504
00:42:59,551 --> 00:43:03,011
学びつづけても
Even if I continue to learn

505
00:43:03,011 --> 00:43:06,561
水晶の星空は
The crystal starry sky

506
00:43:06,591 --> 00:43:09,511
遠すぎるの
Is far too distant

507
00:43:13,361 --> 00:43:15,261
まだ触れないで
Don't touch me yet

508
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,311
その震える指先は
Those trembling fingertips

509
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,011
花盗みの
Are like a flower-stealer's

510
00:43:19,061 --> 00:43:20,761
甘い躊躇い
Sweet hesitation

511
00:43:20,811 --> 00:43:21,961
触れていい
You may touch me

512
00:43:22,011 --> 00:43:24,461
この深い胸の奥まで
If you have the confidence

513
00:43:24,491 --> 00:43:27,511
届く自信があるのならば
To reach the depths of my heart

514
00:43:29,411 --> 00:43:32,761
白馬の王子様なんて
A prince on a white horse?

515
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:36,511
信じてるわけじゃない
It's not that I believe in such a thing

516
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,261
緋に染まった
Stained in scarlet

517
00:43:48,311 --> 00:43:50,461
ガラスケースに飾られた
Displayed in a glass case

518
00:43:50,511 --> 00:43:52,761
純潔は
My purity

519
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:57,011
滅びゆく天使たちの心臓
Is the heart of perishing angels

520
00:44:00,761 --> 00:44:02,311
また明日も
Again tomorrow

521
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:03,961
目醒めるたびに
Every time I wake up

522
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:08,411
百年の刻を知る
I learn of a hundred years of time

523
00:44:08,461 --> 00:44:09,911
眠れない
Unsleeping

524
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:14,511
魂の茨姫
Sleeping beauty of the soul

525
00:44:15,461 --> 00:44:18,511
重すぎる冠
A crown too heavy

526
00:44:18,551 --> 00:44:21,761
ひと滴の血に
In a single drop of blood

527
00:44:21,811 --> 00:44:25,461
あえかな真実を
I come to know

528
00:44:25,511 --> 00:44:29,511
想い知るの
The fragile truth

529
00:44:32,111 --> 00:44:33,761
まだ行かないで
Don't go yet

530
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:35,911
月明かりの結界
The barrier of moonlight

531
00:44:35,961 --> 00:44:39,461
過ちに気づいてしまいそう
I feel I might notice the mistake

532
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:42,361
安らかな温もりに
I want to be embraced

533
00:44:42,411 --> 00:44:44,461
抱かれ壊れたい
In peaceful warmth and break

534
00:44:44,511 --> 00:44:47,711
私は罪の子なのでしょうか
Am I a child of sin?

535
00:44:47,761 --> 00:44:50,261
そっとこぼれてくる
I don't even know the meaning

536
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:54,511
涙の意味さえわからない
Of the tears that softly spill

537
00:45:31,919 --> 00:45:35,319
呪文めいたその言葉 愛なんて
That word that sounds like a spell... "Love"...

538
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:39,119
鎖のように重い
is heavy as a chain.

539
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,519
甘やかして撫でるより
Rather than spoiling and petting me...

540
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:45,819
どんな覚悟もできるならば
if you can make any kind of resolve...

541
00:45:45,819 --> 00:45:49,419
震える唇で蜜を摘む
With trembling lips, plucking nectar...

542
00:45:49,419 --> 00:45:52,619
狩人のときめき
is the hunter's thrill.

543
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:56,019
この深い胸の奥底を
If you have the courage

544
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:59,719
射抜く勇気があるのならば
to shoot through the depths of this heart...

545
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:05,219
あなた捕まえただけじゃ
I didn't just catch you.

546
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:10,619
逃がさないようにして
I'll make sure you can't escape.

547
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:31,919
ありがとう！
Thank you!

548
00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:36,619
はい！ということで
Yes! So...

549
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:41,219
百鬼先輩、AZKiちゃん、そしてラプラスが来てくれました！ありがとう！
Nakiri-senpai, AZKi-chan, and La+ came to perform! Thank you!

550
00:46:41,619 --> 00:46:46,319
ということで、次の曲はオリジナル曲を歌いたいと思います！
So, for the next song, I'd like to sing an original song!

551
00:46:46,919 --> 00:46:51,519
今日このライブのあとにアニメーションMVが投稿される...
After this live today, an animation MV will be posted...

552
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:54,519
おらくる！
Oracle!

553
00:47:09,004 --> 00:47:13,957
みんなー！まだまだ盛り上がれますかー！？
Everyone! Can you still get hyped up!?

554
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:17,645
あともう少しでこのライブも終わってしまいます！
This live will be over in just a bit more!

555
00:47:17,645 --> 00:47:22,619
最後まで全力出して盛り上がっていくぞー！
Let's get hyped up with all our strength until the end!

556
00:47:23,919 --> 00:47:27,819
ヒトヒトで埋まった商店街賑わってた
The shopping district was bustling with crowds of people.

557
00:47:27,819 --> 00:47:31,519
追い込んじゃったんだ
I've been backed into a corner.

558
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,519
チカチカって真っ赤な電灯消そうか
Shall we turn off the flickering, bright red light?

559
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,519
運んでいた いなくなっちゃったった
It was carrying... now they're all gone.

560
00:47:47,419 --> 00:47:51,119
カンカランとカンカラ鳴った信号が鳴ってた
The signal went 'clink-clank' and rang out.

561
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,619
突っ立っちゃってんだ
I'm just standing there.

562
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:58,519
フラフラと真っ青なお面そやつ連れてないですか
Staggering with a bright blue mask, don't you have that guy with you?

563
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:02,719
あれあれ聞こえますか それ吐き出しちゃいますか どうぞ
Hey hey, can you hear? Shall we spit it out? Go ahead.

564
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:06,319
欠陥品と嘲笑して ろくでなしと見下して
Mocked as a defective product, looked down on as a scoundrel...

565
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,819
あの日けなした壊滅は自分の方でした
The one I ridiculed that day... it was actually me who was destroyed.

566
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:14,519
あらあら剥いて だんだん希望になれ
Peel it off, bit by bit, and become hope.

567
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,319
根本的な良い子になるまで愛してあげるね
I'll love you until you become a good child at your core.

568
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,119
大丈夫 強欲で満たして ぶつぶつに恋で肥やして
It's okay, fill it with greed, and fatten it up with fragmented love.

569
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:25,819
骨の髄まで ちゃんと奥まで ちゃんと愛愛愛ラブユー
To the marrow of your bones, deep inside... truly love, love, love, I love you.

570
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:44,919
足りない 足りない こっち足りない ママに甘えちゃって
Not enough, not enough, not enough over here. Being pampered by Mama.

571
00:48:44,919 --> 00:48:48,619
愛しいね 可愛いね おめめに映った有象無象が全部理想
How dear, how cute. All the rabble reflected in those eyes is ideal.

572
00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:52,319
君が遣わした言の葉まさに 撫で撫でしてあげるから
I'll give those words you sent a nice headpat.

573
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:56,019
こっちおいで愛お上手だね （へっほっえっほっ）
Come here, you're so good at loving. (He-ho-e-ho)

574
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:59,719
やらねばね 息が吸えたね 息が吐けたね 一人きりで今日もお過ごしてね
Gotta do it, right? You could breathe in, you could breathe out. Spending another day all alone.

575
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:03,419
意味が上手だね 口が上手だね 泣いた顔もキュンときちゃって
You're so good at meanings, so good with words. Even your crying face makes my heart flutter.

576
00:49:03,419 --> 00:49:11,719
あぁ、君の存在から放たれたすべてが間違いだし正しいし有り得ないぐらいもう愛しくて愛しくて堪らないんだけど、多分１％も伝わらないからこれからも君の上から、いくらでもいくらでもいくらでも注いであげるからね、ちゅー
Ah, everything released from your existence is wrong yet right, and I love it so much I can't stand it, but since probably not even 1% gets across, from now on, I'll pour it over you from above, as much as I want, as much as I want, as much as I want, mwah.

577
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:15,319
しゃーないね しゃーないね 君のせいじゃないもんね
It's inevitable, it's inevitable. It's not your fault, is it?

578
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:19,119
しゃーないね しゃーないね ねんねしたいよね もういっちょ
It's inevitable, it's inevitable. You want to go night-night, right? One more time.

579
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,819
しゃーないね しゃーないね 泣いても泣いても来ないね
It's inevitable, it's inevitable. No matter how much you cry, no one comes.

580
00:49:22,819 --> 00:49:28,619
しゃーないね しゃーないね 誰も返事しないもんね あー
It's inevitable, it's inevitable. No matter who you cry to, no one answers. Ah...

581
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:32,419
あらあら もうそんな傷つけたりしないで
Oh dear, don't hurt them like that anymore.

582
00:49:32,419 --> 00:49:36,319
こんなバケモノだらけの世界に生んじゃってごめんね
Sorry for bringing you into this world full of monsters.

583
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:40,119
大丈夫 安全圏に行こうね 安心な世界に行こうね
It's okay, let's go to the safe zone. Let's go to a peaceful world.

584
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:43,619
居させないから ずっと今日も 一緒
I won't let you stay there, always, today too, together.

585
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:47,019
あらあら剥いて だんだん希望になれ
Peel it off, bit by bit, and become hope.

586
00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:50,819
根本的な善になるまで愛してあげるね
I'll love you until you become a good person at your core.

587
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:54,519
大丈夫 強欲で満たして ぶつぶつに恋で肥やして
It's okay, fill it with greed, and fatten it up with fragmented love.

588
00:49:54,519 --> 00:50:01,119
忘れちゃうから 笑っちゃうから ちゃんと愛愛愛ラブユー
Since you'll forget, since you'll laugh... truly love, love, love, I love you.

作詞・作曲 さユり
Hana no Tou (Tower of Flowers)
Lyrics and Composition: Sayuri

590
00:50:45,827 --> 00:50:48,427
君が持ってきた漫画
The manga you brought with you

591
00:50:48,427 --> 00:50:51,127
くれた知らない名前の花
And the flowers with names I didn't know you gave me

592
00:50:52,127 --> 00:50:54,627
今日はまだ来ないかな?
I wonder if they'll come today?

593
00:50:54,627 --> 00:50:57,427
初めての感情 知ってしまった
I've learned a feeling for the first time

594
00:50:58,627 --> 00:51:00,927
窓に飾った絵画をなぞって
Tracing the painting by the window

595
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:03,427
1人で宇宙を旅して
Traveling through space alone

596
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:06,027
それだけで
That should have

597
00:51:06,027 --> 00:51:08,627
いいはずだったのに
been enough, but...

598
00:51:09,627 --> 00:51:12,627
君の手を握ってしまったら
Once I've taken your hand

599
00:51:12,627 --> 00:51:15,427
孤独を知らないこの街には
In this city that doesn't know loneliness

600
00:51:15,627 --> 00:51:20,927
もう二度と帰ってくることはできないのでしょう
I probably won't be able to return ever again

601
00:51:32,327 --> 00:51:34,927
君が手を差し伸べた
You reached out your hand

602
00:51:34,927 --> 00:51:37,427
光で影が生まれる
Shadows are born from light

603
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:40,327
歌って聴かせて
Sing to me

604
00:51:40,327 --> 00:51:42,927
この話の続き
the continuation of this story

605
00:51:43,127 --> 00:51:46,027
連れていって
Take me

606
00:51:46,027 --> 00:51:48,927
みたことない
to a star

607
00:51:49,127 --> 00:51:54,627
星まで
I've never seen before

608
00:52:06,127 --> 00:52:08,627
誰の手も声も届かない
Where no one's hand or voice can reach

609
00:52:08,627 --> 00:52:11,627
高く聳え立った塔の上へ
Atop the tower that stands tall

610
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:14,627
飛ばす風船葛
Flying balloon vines

611
00:52:14,627 --> 00:52:17,627
僕は君に笑ってほしいんだ
I want you to smile

612
00:52:18,627 --> 00:52:20,927
満たされない穴は
The hole that can't be filled

613
00:52:20,927 --> 00:52:23,927
惰性な会話や澄ましたポーズで
With idle conversation or a composed pose

614
00:52:24,127 --> 00:52:28,627
これまでは埋めてきたけれど
I've filled it until now, but...

615
00:52:29,327 --> 00:52:32,127
退屈な日々を
Kicking away

616
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,627
蹴散らして
the boring days

617
00:52:34,627 --> 00:52:37,327
君と二人で
Together with you

618
00:52:37,327 --> 00:52:40,127
この街中を
through this city

619
00:52:40,127 --> 00:52:42,927
泳げたら
How wonderful

620
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:45,627
それはどれだけ
it would be

621
00:52:45,627 --> 00:52:50,627
素敵なことでしょう
if we could swim through it

622
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:54,427
出したことないほど大きな
Louder than I've ever produced

623
00:52:54,427 --> 00:52:57,427
声でやっと君に伝わる
My voice finally reaches you

624
00:52:57,427 --> 00:53:02,127
歪なぐらいがきっとちょうどいいわ
A little distorted is probably just right

625
00:53:02,627 --> 00:53:05,427
世界の端と
Connecting

626
00:53:05,427 --> 00:53:07,927
端を結んで
the ends of the world

627
00:53:26,127 --> 00:53:28,627
窓に飾った絵画をなぞって
Tracing the painting by the window

628
00:53:28,627 --> 00:53:31,627
1人で宇宙を旅して
Traveling through space alone

629
00:53:32,127 --> 00:53:36,627
それだけでもう不自由ないけど
I'm already satisfied with just that, but...

630
00:53:37,127 --> 00:53:39,927
僕は選んでみたいの
I want to choose

631
00:53:39,927 --> 00:53:42,927
沸き上がる心 謎だらけの空を
the surging heart and the mysterious sky

632
00:53:43,327 --> 00:53:47,427
安全なループを今
The safe loop, now

633
00:53:47,427 --> 00:53:51,427
書き換えて！
rewrite it!

634
00:53:52,427 --> 00:53:54,927
君の手を握ってしまったら
Once I've taken your hand

635
00:53:55,127 --> 00:53:57,427
孤独を知らない
In this city that doesn't know

636
00:53:57,427 --> 00:54:01,927
この街には
loneliness

637
00:54:04,127 --> 00:54:06,627
もう二度と
I probably won't

638
00:54:06,627 --> 00:54:09,127
帰ってくることはできない
be able to return ever again

639
00:54:09,127 --> 00:54:13,927
のでしょう
will I?

640
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:17,627
いくらでも迷いながら
While getting lost as much as we like

641
00:54:17,627 --> 00:54:20,427
光も影も
Both the light

642
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:25,627
見に行こう
and the shadows, let's go see them

643
00:54:26,127 --> 00:54:28,927
歌って聴かせて
Sing to me

644
00:54:28,927 --> 00:54:31,627
この話の続き
the continuation of this story

645
00:54:31,627 --> 00:54:34,427
連れていって
Take me

646
00:54:34,427 --> 00:54:37,127
みたことない
to a star

647
00:54:37,127 --> 00:54:43,127
星まで
I've never seen before

648
00:54:44,127 --> 00:54:46,627
世界の端と
Connecting

649
00:54:46,627 --> 00:54:49,127
端を結んで
the ends of the world

650
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:55,427
ラスト1曲、この5人で歌わせていただきました！
For the last song, the five of us performed it for you!

651
00:54:55,427 --> 00:54:57,627
ありがとうございましたー！
Thank you very much!

652
00:55:00,175 --> 00:55:01,975
（歌唱）
(Singing)

653
00:55:01,975 --> 00:55:03,375
うおー！
Woo-hoo!

654
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:04,675
