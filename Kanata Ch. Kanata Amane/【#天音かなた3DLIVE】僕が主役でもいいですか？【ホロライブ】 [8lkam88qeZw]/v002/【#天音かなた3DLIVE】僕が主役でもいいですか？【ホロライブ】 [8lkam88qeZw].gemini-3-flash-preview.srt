Let's get started.

14
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,800
お待たせしましたー！
I've kept you waiting!

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000

My 1st anniversary, I'm Amane Kanata! Best regards!

16
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,250
どうだっていい言を　嘘って吐いて戻れない
Words that don't matter, I spat them out as lies and can't go back

17
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,250
時効なんてやってこない　奪ったように奪われて
The statute of limitations will never come, being robbed just as I robbed others

18
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,250
今日だって叶わない　思ったように騙せない
Even today, it won't come true, I can't deceive as I intended

19
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,300
腐っている僕には　腐ったものがわからない
For someone as rotten as me, I can't tell what's rotten anymore

20
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,150
おいで　ココまで
Come here, this far

21
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,000
成れ！！
Become!!

22
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,250
隠して仕舞ったんだ
I ended up hiding it all away

23
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,300
メーデー僕と判っても
Mayday, even if you realize it's me

24
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,300
抱き締めなくていいんだよ
You don't have to hold me tight

25
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,300
メーデー僕が解ったら
Mayday, if you understand me

26
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,200
もう一度嘲笑ってくれるかな
I wonder if you'll laugh at me once more

27
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,200
Wow Wow Wow...

28
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,400
魔物だって知るんだよ
Knowing that I'm just a monster

29
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,200
Wow Wow Wow...

30
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,400
嘘つきだって知るんだよ
Knowing that I'm just a liar

31
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,300
ねえ
Hey

32
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,300
戻ったはずが　キョドってYESを声に出す
I thought I'd returned, but I awkwardly shout 'YES' aloud

33
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,300
後悔の脆弱は　騙したほうが正義なの
The fragility of regret, is it justice to be the one who deceives?

34
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,350
卑怯だって構わない　祈っておいてそれはない
I don't care if I'm a coward, I prayed for it, but it's not like that

35
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,400
飾っていた饒舌が　墓穴を掘って焼ける様
The eloquence I'd been flaunting, is like digging my own grave and burning

36
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,500
負い目　どこまで
Debt, how much further?

37
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,500
灰色！！
Gray!!

38
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,350
被害者ヅラしたんだ
I played the victim

39
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,450
メーデー僕を叱ってよ
Mayday, please scold me

40
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,550
正直者が夢見たなら
If an honest person were to dream

41
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,600
メーデー僕を裁いてよ
Mayday, please judge me

42
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,600
最後まで甘えてしまうのは
Indulging myself until the very end is...

43
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,300
Wow Wow Wow...

44
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,350
幽霊だって知るんだよ
Knowing that I'm just a ghost

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,300
Wow Wow Wow...

46
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
空白だって知るんだよ
Knowing that I'm just a void

47
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,300
ねえ
Hey

48
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,350
足りないものを望んだら　僕じゃない僕に出会ったよ
If I wish for what I lack, I encountered a 'me' that wasn't me

49
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,000
それでも前に進んだの　クラクラしちゃう夜も
Even so, I moved forward, even through dizzying nights

50
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,133
育てたの　君には僕が見えるか
I raised it. Can you see me?

51
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:05,133
孤独なピエロが
A lonely clown...

52
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:09,333
メーデー　僕と判っても　もう抱き締めなくていいんだよ
Mayday, even if you know it's me, you don't have to hold me anymore.

53
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,733
メーデー　僕が解ったら
Mayday, if you understand me...

54
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:14,433
もう一度　嘲笑ってくれるかな
Will you sneer at me once more?

55
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:19,433
メーデー　僕を叱ってよ　正直者が夢見たいなら
Mayday, scold me; if an honest person wants to dream...

56
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:23,933
メーデー　僕を裁いてよ　最後まで甘えてしまうのは
Mayday, judge me; depending on you until the very end is...

57
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:28,433
メーデー　僕を暴いてよ　もう直終わるこの世界から
Mayday, expose me; from this world that's about to end...

58
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:32,433
メーデー　僕と踊ってよ　最初からイナイと理解してた？
Mayday, dance with me; did you know I wasn't here from the start?

59
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:41,533
Wow... 嘘憑きだって知るんだよ
Wow... I'll find out you're a liar.

60
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:48,433
Wow... 亡霊だって知るんだよ
Wow... I'll find out you're a ghost.

61
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:51,133
Wow... 空白だって知るんだよ
Wow... I'll find out it's a void.

62
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:55,633
どうだっていい言を　嘘って吐いて戻れない
Spitting out trivial words as lies, I can't go back.

63
00:05:55,633 --> 00:06:00,033
時効なんてやってこない　奪ったように奪われて
A statute of limitations will never come; I'm robbed just as I robbed.

64
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:28,033
沈むように溶けてゆくように
As if sinking, as if melting away.

65
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:34,033
二人だけの空が広がる夜に
Into the night where a sky for just the two of us unfolds.

66
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:53,933
「さよなら」だけだった
It was only a "goodbye."

67
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,533
その一言で全てが分かった
With that single word, I understood everything.

68
00:06:56,533 --> 00:07:01,533
陽が沈み出した空と君の姿
The sky where the sun had begun to set and your silhouette...

69
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:05,233
フェンス越しに重なっていた
...were overlapping through the fence.

70
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:08,733
初めて会った日から
From the day we first met,

71
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:11,833
僕の心の全てを奪った
you stole every part of my heart.

72
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:16,833
どこか儚い空気を纏う君は
You, shrouded in a somewhat fleeting atmosphere,

73
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,433
寂しい目をしてたんだ
had such lonely eyes.

74
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:22,533
いつだってチックタックと鳴る世界で
In a world that's always ticking away,

75
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:23,733
何度だってさ
time and time again,

76
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:26,733
触れる心ない言葉うるさい声に
even if heartless words and noisy voices touch me,

77
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:28,333
涙が零れそうでも
and tears are about to fall,

78
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,833
ありきたりな喜び
ordinary happiness is something

79
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:34,233
きっと二人なら見つけられる
I'm sure the two of us can find.

80
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:37,733
騒がしい日々に笑えない君に
To you, who can't smile in these noisy days,

81
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:41,533
思い付く限り眩しい明日を
I'll give as dazzling a tomorrow as I can imagine.

82
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:46,533
明けない夜に落ちてゆく前に
Before we fall into a night that never ends,

83
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:50,033
僕の手を掴んでほら
come on, take my hand.

84
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:54,033
忘れてしまいたくて閉じ込めた日々も
Even the days I locked away, wanting to forget them,

85
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:56,533
抱きしめた温もりで溶かすから
I'll melt them away with the warmth of my embrace.

86
00:07:56,533 --> 00:08:01,533
怖くないよいつか日が昇るまで
Don't be afraid; until the sun rises someday,

87
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:04,033
二人でいよう
let's stay together.

88
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:20,633
君にしか見えない
I hate the way you look

89
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,733
何かを見つめる君が嫌いだ
at something only you can see.

90
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:27,033
見惚れているかのような
As if you're entranced,

91
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,533
恋するような
as if you're in love...

92
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:31,033
そんな顔が嫌いだ
I hate that look on your face.

93
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:34,033
信じていたいけど信じれないこと
Things I want to believe but can't,

94
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:36,533
そんなのどうしたってきっと
no matter what, I'm sure

95
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,033
これからだっていくつもあって
there will be many of those from now on,

96
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:41,033
そのたんび怒って泣いていくの
and each time, we'll get angry and cry.

97
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:43,033
それでもきっといつかはきっと
Even so, surely someday, surely we

98
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,033
僕らはきっと
will surely

99
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:47,033
分かり合えるさ信じてるよ
understand each other; I believe it.

100
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:03,033
「もう嫌だ」って疲れたんだって
"I'm sick of this," "I'm tired," you say,

101
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:05,233
がむしゃらに差し伸べた
shaking off my hand

102
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:07,433
僕の手を振り払う君
that I reached out so frantically.

103
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:11,033
「もう嫌だ」って疲れたよなんて
"I'm sick of this," "I'm tired,"

104
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:14,633
本当は僕も言いたいんだ
truth is, I want to say those words too.

105
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:18,033
ほらまたチックタックと鳴る世界で
Look, in this world ticking away again,

106
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,333
何度だってさ
time after time,

107
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,033
君のために用意した言葉
none of the words I prepared for you

108
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,533
どれも届かない
seem to reach you.

109
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:26,333
「終わりにしたい」だなんてさ
When I got swept up and said,

110
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,533
釣られて言葉にした時
"I want to end this,"

111
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,233
君は初めて笑った
you smiled for the very first time.

112
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:35,033
騒がしい日々に笑えなくなっていた
In these noisy days where I'd forgotten how to smile,

113
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,033
僕の目に映る君は綺麗だ
you, reflected in my eyes, are beautiful.

114
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:43,033
明けない夜に溢れた涙も
Even the tears shed in the never-ending night

115
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:46,033
君の笑顔に溶けていく
melt away into your smile.

116
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:51,033
変わらない日々に泣いていた僕を
I, who was crying in these unchanging days,

117
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:54,033
君は優しく終わりへと誘う
you gently invite me toward the end.

118
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:59,033
沈むように溶けてゆくように
As if sinking, as if melting away,

119
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:01,033
染み付いた霧が晴れる
the deep-seated mist clears.

120
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:01,395
君が跳ねる
You bounce

121
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:02,395
眩しいほどに
So bright

122
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:03,395
美しくて
And beautiful

123
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:05,145
閉じ込めてしまいたくて
I wanted to lock you away

124
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:06,295
秘密の場所に
In a secret place

125
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:07,945
差し伸べてくれた
The hand you reached out

126
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:09,545
君の手を取る
I take it

127
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:11,195
涼しい風が
A cool breeze

128
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:13,145
空を泳ぐように今
As if swimming through the sky

129
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,545
吹き抜けていく
Blows through right now

130
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:18,445
繋いだ手を離さないでよ
Don't let go of my hand

131
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:23,045
二人今、夜に駆け出していく
The two of us are running into the night now

132
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:15,045
秒針を噛む
作詞 ACAね / 作曲 ぬゆり、ACAね
Byoushin wo Kamu
Lyrics: ACAne / Composition: nulut, ACAne

133
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:26,445
退屈な希望
Boring hope

134
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:29,045
いつも通り通り過ぎた
Passed by as usual

135
00:11:29,095 --> 00:11:31,045
一回とわかった 戻らない
I understood once, it's not coming back

136
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:33,745
確信犯でしょ？
You're a convinced criminal, right?

137
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:36,445
夕食中に泣いた後
After crying during dinner

138
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,545
君は笑ってた
You were laughing

139
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:40,745
私もそうだよ
Saying, "me too,"

140
00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:43,045
って 偽りの気持ち被せて
Covering it with fake feelings

141
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:44,245
吐いて黙って
Spitting it out, keeping silent

142
00:11:44,295 --> 00:11:46,045
ずっと黙って
Forever keeping silent

143
00:11:46,445 --> 00:11:48,745
何が何でも
No matter what

144
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:51,445
面と向かって「さよなら」
Saying "goodbye" to your face

145
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:53,545
する資格もないまま
Without even the right to do so

146
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:54,545
僕は
I am...

147
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:57,745
灰に潜り 秒針を噛み
Diving into the ash, biting the second hand

148
00:11:57,795 --> 00:12:01,345
白昼夢の中でガンガン砕いた
Crushing it away in a daydream

149
00:12:01,445 --> 00:12:03,445
でも壊れない
But it won't break

150
00:12:03,495 --> 00:12:05,145
止まってくれない
It won't stop for me

151
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:08,745
本当は知らないまま進むのさ
Advancing while not really knowing the truth

152
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:13,845
このまま奪って 隠して 忘れたい
I want to steal it away, hide it, and forget like this

153
00:12:13,895 --> 00:12:18,445
分かり合うまるひとつもなくても
Even if there's not a single point we understand

154
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:21,845
会って「ごめん」って返さないでね
Don't meet me and say "sorry" in return

155
00:12:21,895 --> 00:12:26,545
形のない言葉はいらないから
Because I don't need formless words

156
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:42,245
気安い一生
An easy life

157
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,345
何でも受け止めると言ったきり
Ever since saying I'd accept anything

158
00:12:45,395 --> 00:12:47,445
何も変えることはない
There's nothing to change

159
00:12:47,845 --> 00:12:49,945
誰でも
Anyone

160
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:53,045
僕の代わりじゃなくても 君に守られた
Even if it wasn't my replacement, I was protected by you

161
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:57,645
目も口も
Eyes and mouth

162
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:00,145
意味がないほどに
To the point of being meaningless

163
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:01,345
塞ぎ込んで
Sinking into silence

164
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:03,045
動けない僕を
I, who cannot move

165
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:05,145
見つけないで
Don't find me

166
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:07,445
ほっといてくんないか
Won't you leave me alone?

167
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,045
どこ見ても どこにいても 終わらない
No matter where I look or where I am, it doesn't end

168
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:13,445
灰に潜り 秒針を噛み
Diving into the ash, biting the second hand

169
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:16,845
白昼夢の中でガンガン砕いた
Crushing it away in a daydream

170
00:13:17,145 --> 00:13:19,245
でも壊れない
But it won't break

171
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:20,945
止まってくれない
It won't stop for me

172
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:24,045
演じ続けるのなんだ？
What is it that I keep performing?

173
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:29,345
このまま奪って 隠して 忘れたい
I want to steal it away, hide it, and forget like this

174
00:13:29,395 --> 00:13:33,945
分かり合うまるひとつもなくても
Even if there's not a single point we understand

175
00:13:33,995 --> 00:13:37,345
会って「ごめん」って返さないでね
Don't meet me and say "sorry" in return

176
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:42,045
形のない言葉はいらないから
Because I don't need formless words

177
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:48,345
姿叫んで
Screaming the figure

178
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,545
明日は来ない
Tomorrow won't come

179
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:52,445
嘲笑うなら情けない
If you mock me, it's pathetic

180
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:54,645
誰のせいでもないこと
Something that's nobody's fault

181
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:56,445
あら探しのせいにしたくて
I wanted to blame it on fault-finding

182
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:58,545
化けているのかな
Am I pretending?

183
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:00,345
本当は分かってるんだ
I actually know the truth

184
00:14:00,395 --> 00:14:03,845
見放されても 信じてしまうよ
Even if I'm abandoned, I end up believing

185
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:24,545
このまま奪って 隠して 忘れたい
I want to steal it away, hide it, and forget like this

186
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:31,545
このまま奪って 隠して 忘れたい
I want to steal it away, hide it, and forget like this

187
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:38,545
このまま奪って 隠して 放したい
I want to steal it away, hide it, and let go

188
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:43,745
分かり合うまるひとつもなくても
Even if there's not a single point we understand

189
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:47,245
会って「ごめん」って返さないでね
Don't meet me and say "sorry" in return

190
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,045
形のない
As ourselves

191
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:50,545
僕らして
Without form

192
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:52,545
そこは消えない
That won't disappear

193
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:58,045
嘘はいらないから
Because I don't need lies

194
00:15:00,657 --> 00:15:02,857
Lai-Lai...

195
00:15:38,057 --> 00:15:41,057
KING
作詞・作曲：Kanaria
KING
Lyrics & Music: Kanaria

196
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:49,057
ハイ！ハイ！
Hi! Hi!

197
00:15:49,857 --> 00:15:52,457
幽閉利口逝く前に
Before confined cleverness passes away

198
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:55,257
幽閉利口に難儀だい
It's a struggle for confined cleverness

199
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:58,257
幽閉ストップ 知ってないし
I don't know anything about a confined stop

200
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:01,357
勘弁にしといてなんて惨憺
Saying 'give me a break' is so wretched

201
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:04,257
ひたひたと降る欠片のアイロニー
The irony of fragments falling steadily

202
00:16:04,257 --> 00:16:07,157
誰もが願う無機質なような
Like the inorganic state everyone wishes for

203
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:10,057
一足先に始めて太陽な
Starting a step ahead, like the sun

204
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:13,257
先が見えないバンジーハッピーショー
A bungee happy show where you can't see ahead

205
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:19,057
無いのあなたにお願い一つ
I have one request for you who has nothing

206
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:21,857
相も変わらずおまけにワーニワーニ
As usual, and furthermore, worry worry

207
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:24,757
無いのあなたにお願い一つ
I have one request for you who has nothing

208
00:16:24,757 --> 00:16:27,757
張り詰めた思い込め
Putting all my pent-up feelings into it

209
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:30,557
Left Side, Right Side

210
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:33,457
歯を剥き出して パッパッパッ
Baring your teeth, pa pa pa

211
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:36,457
照れくさいね
How embarrassing

212
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:38,257
Left Side, Right Side

213
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:40,057
歯を剥き出して パッパッパッ
Baring your teeth, pa pa pa

214
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:41,257
You are KING

215
00:16:41,257 --> 00:16:43,657
You are KING

216
00:16:53,657 --> 00:16:56,557
無邪気に遊ぶ 期待期待のダーリンダーリン
Playing innocently, my expected darling darling

217
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,357
健気に笑う 痛い痛いの消える
Smiling bravely, the pain, pain, goes away

218
00:16:59,357 --> 00:17:02,257
無様に死ねる 苦い思いも無くなって
I can die unsightly, with all bitter thoughts gone

219
00:17:02,257 --> 00:17:05,157
ラララブラットタッタ
La la Love Rat-ta-ta

220
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,857
嫌い嫌いの最低泣いてら
Hate, hate, I'm crying at my worst

221
00:17:07,857 --> 00:17:10,757
無いのあなたにお願い一つ
I have one request for you who has nothing

222
00:17:10,757 --> 00:17:13,557
相も変わらず自虐のワーニワーニ
As usual, self-deprecating worry worry

223
00:17:13,557 --> 00:17:16,457
無いのあなたにお願い一つ
I have one request for you who has nothing

224
00:17:16,457 --> 00:17:19,257
張り詰めた思い込め
Putting all my pent-up feelings into it

225
00:17:19,257 --> 00:17:22,057
Left Side, Right Side

226
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:24,957
歯を剥き出して パッパッパッ
Baring your teeth, pa pa pa

227
00:17:24,957 --> 00:17:27,757
邪魔くさいね
How bothersome

228
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:30,557
Left Side, Right Side

229
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:33,457
歯を剥き出して パッパッパッ
Baring your teeth, pa pa pa

230
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:36,557
You are KING

231
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:45,057
You are KING

232
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:59,057
みんな、ありがとう
Thank you everyone!

233
00:17:59,857 --> 00:18:01,857
ということで、ゲストに来てくれました
So, joining me as guests...

234
00:18:01,857 --> 00:18:05,557
同期の常闇トワと、桐生ココです！
...are my fellow 4th gen members, Tokoyami Towa and Kiryu Coco!

235
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:08,557
おめでとう！
Congratulations!

236
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:11,857
初めてね、3人で踊りましたけど
It was our first time performing as a trio...

237
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,257
めっちゃ楽しかった！
...and it was so much fun!

238
00:18:13,257 --> 00:18:14,257
最高！
The best!

239
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:17,357
わちゃわちゃ感が4期生っぽかったな
That chaotic energy was so typical of the 4th gen.

240
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:20,557
みんなびっくりしたんじゃないかな、この二人が来てくれるって
I bet everyone was surprised to see these two show up.

241
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,057
やめなさい、うるさい、うるさい
Stop it! You're being too loud!

242
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:24,257
4期生はね、やっぱり4期生はね
As for the 4th generation... as expected...

243
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:26,357
よいしょ、全員ね
Alright, everyone...

245
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:31,557
1周年を迎えますので
...will be celebrating our 1st anniversary.

246
00:18:31,557 --> 00:18:33,257
そうですよ
That's right!

247
00:18:33,257 --> 00:18:35,557
これからも4期生頑張っていきたいと思いますので
We'll keep doing our best as the 4th generation...

248
00:18:35,557 --> 00:18:41,057
皆さん、応援よろしくお願いします！
...so please keep supporting us!

249
00:18:41,057 --> 00:18:43,057
ありがとう
Thank you!

250
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:45,557
よし、今度はみんなで歌おうな
Alright, let's all sing together next time.

251
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:46,557
歌おう
Let's do it!

252
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:49,857
今度は4期みんなで
Next time, with all of the 4th gen.

253
00:18:49,857 --> 00:18:51,857
とりあえず2021年初めて
Anyway, for the first time in 2021...

254
00:18:51,857 --> 00:18:54,857
最初に歌った歌、これだったんだよ、ほら、4期生の
...this was the first song we sang. It's the 4th gen's...

255
00:18:54,857 --> 00:18:56,557
歌い始め
...first song of the year!

256
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:58,557
ありがとうございます！
Thank you very much!

257
00:18:58,557 --> 00:19:04,057
あけましておめでとうございます！
Happy New Year!

258
00:19:04,057 --> 00:19:06,557
やったよ、本当におめでたいね
We did it! It's really worth celebrating.

259
00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:08,557
1年早かった
The year went by so fast.

260
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:11,057
また今年も頑張りたいと思います、な
I want to work hard again this year, right?

261
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:13,557
もう、4期生、みんなで楽しく頑張ります！
Yeah, the 4th gen will all work hard and have fun together!

頑張ろう、ありがとう
Let's do it! Thank you.

263
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:19,557
トワとココとはちょっと名残惜しいけど、ありがとう
It's a shame to say goodbye to Towa and Coco already, but thank you.

264
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:21,057
かなたのステージだからね
It's your stage, after all.

265
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:24,557
あなたの主役、主役
You're the star! The star!

266
00:19:24,557 --> 00:19:27,557

Thank you! Bye-bye!

ポーズ取っておこうよ、バイバイ！
Let's strike a pose before we go. Bye-bye!

268
00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:44,857
はい、ということでゲストでトワとココが来てくれました
Alright, so Towa and Coco joined us as guests.

269
00:19:44,857 --> 00:19:47,057
いや本当、本当に嬉しい
I'm really, really happy.

270
00:19:47,057 --> 00:19:49,257
この間のね、あの延期になっちゃった日も
Even on the day it was postponed...

271
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:52,557
二人はね、来てくれて、一緒に練習をね、してくれました
...the two of them came and practiced with me.

272
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:55,257
本当に本当に、同期のみんな
Truly, all my gen-mates...

273
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:57,257
今日はね、あの、一緒には歌えなかったけど
I couldn't sing with them today, but...

274
00:19:57,257 --> 00:19:58,557
わためとルーナも
...Watame and Luna too...

275
00:19:58,557 --> 00:20:00,057
かけがえのない、一生、大切...
...are irreplaceable, lifelong treasures...

276
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:03,469
よろしくお願いします。
Thank you very much.

00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,469
それでは次の曲、まいります！
Now, here is the next song!

278
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:11,869
よし、それではステージ、ちょっと移動しちゃおうかな。
Alright, I think I'll move to the other stage now.

279
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:13,669
えっ、えい！
Eh, e-i!

280
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:15,369
あ、来た来た来た来た。
Oh, I'm here, I'm here.

281
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:19,469
それではこちらにて歌わせていただきたいと思います。
Now, I'd like to sing for you here.

282
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:22,069
本日、えっと、22時ですね、
Today, at 10:00 PM,

283
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:25,869
この後、この配信の終わった後、22時15分に投稿されます...
Right after this stream ends, at 10:15 PM, it will be posted...

284
00:20:25,969 --> 00:20:29,069
歌ってみたで歌わせていただきました、アウトサイダー、
The song 'Outsider' that I covered for my cover video,

285
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:31,069
歌いたいと思います。
I'm going to sing it now.

286
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:54,069
アウトサイダー
Outsider

287
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:03,269
ねぇねぇ この世界をどっかからひっくり返したくて
Hey, hey, I want to turn this world upside down from somewhere

288
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:05,769
正義感なんてありもしない
There's no such thing as a sense of justice

289
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:08,869
まあまあそんなんで 少年少女歌いまして
Well, well, with that, boys and girls are singing

290
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:11,769
唸り始めた快進撃さ
The breakthrough has started to roar

291
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:14,369
低体裁で 人体で 傲慢な
Low profile, human body, arrogant

292
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:17,669
最下等で最高な相棒さ
The lowest and greatest partner

293
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:21,069
単純明快な考えが
A simple and clear thought

294
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:24,369
僕をここで覚醒させちゃいないか
Isn't it awakening me here?

295
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:31,969
今この身を以て 重石を剥いで
Now, with this body, peeling off the weights

296
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:35,369
君にだけにしかできないことは何だ
What is it that only you can do?

297
00:21:35,469 --> 00:21:38,769
そこにいないで 慰めなんていらないよ
Don't stay there, I don't need any comfort

298
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:42,369
荒地になってしまわぬように
So that it doesn't become a wasteland

299
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:46,569
その名を隠して ここに現れたのさ
Hiding that name, I appeared here

300
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:52,069
腐ってる奴らを 探って蹴って笑って這いて
Searching for the rotten ones, kicking them, laughing, and crawling

301
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:54,569
現状 縋って
Clinging to the current situation

302
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:56,869
将来ない 勝手にやってな
There's no future, just do what you want

303
00:21:56,969 --> 00:21:59,869
もう配って 否定したって 銘したって 誰かのせいにしたって
Already distributed, even if denied, even if named, even if blamed on someone else

304
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,069
フラッシュバックして 初心者の言い訳して
Flashing back, making excuses like a beginner

305
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:05,869
感情も根も腐ってしまいました
Emotions and roots have both rotted away

306
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:08,869
思い出したくない一日は
The day I don't want to remember

307
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:11,869
ここに吐き出してしまいなよ
Just spit it out right here

308
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:14,369
要らんもんだけ捨て去って
Just throw away only the unnecessary things

309
00:22:14,469 --> 00:22:18,069
僕をここで壊しちゃいないか
Isn't it breaking me here?

310
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:25,869
今はこれを持って 口を噤んで
Now, hold this and shut your mouth

311
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:29,369
染み付いて夜の傷が癒えないのなら
If the deep-seated wounds of the night won't heal

312
00:22:29,469 --> 00:22:33,269
涙は見せないで こんな恥なんていらないよ
Don't show tears, I don't need such shame

313
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:36,769
全て失ってしまわぬように
So that everything isn't lost

314
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:40,869
変わらぬものがここにあるとするならば
If there is something unchanging here

315
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:45,369
夜が明ける前に そう咲いてしまえと
Before the dawn breaks, bloom just like that

316
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:58,869
白と黒の色のない世界に溢れた
Overflowing in a world without white and black colors

317
00:22:58,969 --> 00:23:02,869
愛も全部ないよ その世界に塗れた
There is no love at all, smeared in that world

318
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:07,869
心の庭 決して許してはくれないから
Because the garden of the heart will never forgive me

319
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:11,869
影は伸びきって 日は落ち切って
The shadows have fully stretched, the sun has fully set

320
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:14,769
明日を迎えることが許されたなら
If I were allowed to welcome tomorrow

321
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:18,869
救われてたかな それでも僕は
Would I have been saved? Even so, I...

322
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,469
今この身を以て 重石を剥いで
Now, with this body, peeling off the weights

323
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:28,869
君にだけにしかできないことは何だ
What is it that only you can do?

324
00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:32,269
そこにいないで 慰めなんていらないよ
Don't stay there, I don't need any comfort

325
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,769
荒地になってしまわぬように
So that it doesn't become a wasteland

326
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:39,869
その名を隠して ここに現れたのさ
Hiding that name, I appeared here

327
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:46,069
腐ってる奴らを 探って蹴って笑って這いて
Searching for the rotten ones, kicking them, laughing, and crawling

328
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:56,869
その小さな勇気が 僕の胸を焦がすから
Because that small courage scorches my chest

329
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:39,069
フィクサー
Fixer

330
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:53,369
今日までの記憶の全部を消してしまう時まで眠れない
I can't sleep until the moment I erase all my memories up to today

331
00:24:55,569 --> 00:25:00,069
あしたを歩いていく自分の苦が欲しくてたまらない
I can't help but crave the bitterness of myself walking into tomorrow

332
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:06,581
「大丈夫」と言わせて あとから君のせいにさせてはくれないか
Let me say "it's okay", and later let me blame it on you

333
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:13,581
今更意味ないから あとから君のせいにさせてはくれないか
It's meaningless now, so later let me blame it on you

334
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:18,881
できやしない約束を 滔々と溢れる一言一言ばかり
Endlessly overflowing word by word of promises that can't be kept

335
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:22,581
もう奪われるくらい
Being snatched away so much

336
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:26,581
意味をなさない 何もできない
Making no sense, unable to do anything

337
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:30,481
見えない 逃げたい 飛びたい やめたい そらさないから
I can't see, I want to run, I want to fly, I want to stop, I won't look away

338
00:25:30,581 --> 00:25:34,081
沈め 沈め 這い上がれないほどまで
Sink, sink, until you can't climb back up

339
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:37,581
飽きるまで 落とせ 落とせ
Until you're bored, drop, drop

340
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:41,081
救い垂らす時まで
Until the time of salvation drips

341
00:25:59,581 --> 00:26:03,381
嘘つく粒をのどからしぼり出して日々ごと噛みくだく
Squeezing out the seeds of lies from my throat and crushing them day by day

342
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:10,581
下手な花火でしたような口ぶりにそってやり過ごす
Getting by following the way of speaking like poor fireworks

343
00:26:11,581 --> 00:26:15,581
なりたくはなかった 共役なはずの眠い眠い理想で
I didn't want to become that, with a sleepy, sleepy ideal that should be conjugate

344
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:19,881
救われることを待つ
Waiting to be saved

345
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:23,581
一番目は胃の口だよ
The first is the entrance to the stomach

346
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:27,581
ちから強くかたく痛く噛みしめて
Biting down strongly, firmly, and painfully

347
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:31,081
死んでしまえ 死んでしまえ
Die, die

348
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:34,681
この先も過去も知らず
Knowing neither the future nor the past

349
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:38,281
壊せ 壊せ
Break, break

350
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:41,881
どうせなら加害者になればいい
If anything, you should just become the perpetrator

351
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:44,881
堪えきれない苛立ちも
The unbearable irritation too

352
00:26:45,381 --> 00:26:48,581
何も生まない悲しみも
And the sadness that produces nothing

353
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:52,381
味気なくて吐き出す前に
Before spitting out the tastelessness

354
00:26:52,881 --> 00:26:55,881
もう、もう次を歌え
Already, already sing the next

355
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:22,581
沈め 沈め
Sink, sink

356
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:29,881
壊せ 壊せ
Break, break

357
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:36,281
踊れ 踊れ 灰色になりきる前に
Dance, dance, before becoming completely gray

358
00:27:36,581 --> 00:27:39,881
打ち鳴らせ
Strike and sound

359
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:43,581
変われ 変われ 眠りに落ちる時まで
Change, change, until the moment you fall asleep

360
00:27:47,381 --> 00:27:50,581
奪え 奪え
Snatch, snatch

361
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:54,081
飼いならした嘘あばいて
Expose the tamed lies

362
00:27:54,581 --> 00:27:57,881
見えてあげる 頭に起きた
I'll show you, what happened in my head

363
00:27:58,281 --> 00:28:01,381
虚像を見ていた
I was looking at a virtual image

364
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:04,881
虚像を見ていた
I was looking at a virtual image

Floating, tumbling down, meeting the end roll

367
00:29:30,581 --> 00:29:35,381
歪んで 変わり果てた 未来の走馬灯
Distorted, completely changed lantern of the future

368
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:40,281
おしまいな 幕の切れてしまった白昼夢は
It's over, the daydream whose curtain has been cut

369
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:45,081
ただただ 虚しさ達を 暈してみせた
Just blurring the emptinesses

370
00:29:46,581 --> 00:29:50,081
思い出してしまう 夕焼ける空
I end up remembering, the sunset sky

371
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:54,081
滲むメロディ
The blurring melody

372
00:29:54,581 --> 00:30:00,081
「帰ろう、道を間違わないように」
"Let's go home, so as not to lose our way"

Additional Memory

374
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:03,493
逆さまになって ぎゅっと繋いだ手を宙に浮かべて
Turned upside down, I let go of our tightly clasped hands into the air

375
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:07,793
泣いてしまって 買ってしまって 贅沢な走馬灯
I ended up crying, ended up buying into a luxurious kaleidoscope of memories

376
00:30:07,993 --> 00:30:13,093
夕風の向こうに 恋を認めたためて 火を灯す
Beyond the evening breeze, I admit my love and light a fire

377
00:30:13,293 --> 00:30:17,593
過ぎ去ってゆく 腐ってゆく 溶かした本音は
Passing by, rotting away, my melted true feelings

378
00:30:17,793 --> 00:30:22,593
存在証明を 拒んでしまったストーリー
A story that rejected its own proof of existence

379
00:30:23,793 --> 00:30:27,693
「私なんてさ」言いたくなかったな
I didn't want to say, "Someone like me..."

380
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:32,493
拭えない涙も 言葉も嘘も
The tears I can't wipe away, the words, the lies

381
00:30:32,793 --> 00:30:37,493
友達なんかに なりたくなかったな
I never wanted us to just be friends

382
00:30:37,893 --> 00:30:41,893
きっと届かないよな ごめんね 大好きだよ
It surely won't reach you, will it? I'm sorry, I love you

383
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:05,993
これが勘違いなら 知りたくなかったな
If this is all a misunderstanding, I didn't want to know

384
00:31:06,193 --> 00:31:11,293
溢れ出す涙が 空に吸い込まれる
My overflowing tears are swallowed up by the sky

385
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:15,593
もう戻れないのに もう帰れないのに
Even though I can't go back, even though I can't return

386
00:31:15,693 --> 00:31:21,093
今更疼くんだよ 逆さまになったまま
It's aching now, remaining upside down

387
00:31:31,993 --> 00:31:36,293
散っていった 散っていった 散っていった走馬灯
Scattered, scattered, the scattered kaleidoscope of memories

388
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:40,893
夕映えの向こう 想いを染め上げた 後悔の詩
Beyond the sunset, a poem of regret dyed with my feelings

消さないでいて 覚えていて 残した本音は

幸せを拒んでしまったストーリー
A story that ended up rejecting happiness

391
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:55,393
友達なんかで 終わりたくなかったな
I didn't want it to end with us just being friends

392
00:31:55,593 --> 00:32:00,093
届かない涙が 空に吸い込まれる
My unreaching tears are swallowed up by the sky

393
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:04,993
これが勘違いでも これが勘違いでも
Even if this is a misunderstanding, even if it's a mistake

394

ずっと言いたかったの さよなら 大好きだよ
I've always wanted to say: Goodbye, I love you

396
00:33:13,393 --> 00:33:17,493
逃げ出した夜の往来 行方は未だ不明
Traffic in the night I ran away into; destination still unknown

397
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:22,093
回り回って虚しくって 困っちゃったワンワンワン
Going round and round, it's so empty, I'm at a loss, woof woof woof

398
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:26,393
失ったつもりもないのに 何か足りない気分
I don't think I've lost anything, yet I feel like something's missing

399
00:33:26,593 --> 00:33:31,393
ちょっと変にハイになって 吹かし込んだ四輪車
Getting a bit strangely high, revving up my four-wheeled car

400
00:33:32,893 --> 00:33:36,793
兄弟よ 如何しよう もう何も考えない様
Brother, what should we do? Let's try not to think about anything

401
00:33:36,993 --> 00:33:41,393
銀河系の外れへと さよなら
Saying goodbye as we head to the edge of the galaxy

402
00:33:41,593 --> 00:33:45,893
真実も道徳も 動作しないイカれた夜でも
Even on a crazy night where truth and morality don't function

403
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:50,493
僕ら手を叩いて笑いあう
We'll clap our hands and laugh together

404
00:33:50,693 --> 00:33:55,293
ダダダダ シラネーナンダカンダ
Da da da da, I don't know, this and that

405
00:33:57,193 --> 00:34:01,693
たった一瞬のこの煌めきを
This brilliance of just a single moment

406
00:34:01,893 --> 00:34:06,593
食べ尽くそう二人で くだばるまで
Let's the two of us devour it all until we drop dead

407
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:11,393
そして幸運を 僕らに祈りを
And then, pray for good luck for us

408
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:16,393
まだ行こう 誰も追いつけないくらいのスピードで
Let's keep going, at a speed that nobody can catch up to

409
00:34:16,593 --> 00:34:20,893
稲妻のように生きていたいだけ
I just want to live like a bolt of lightning

410
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:26,093
お前はどうしたい？返事はいらない
What do you want to do? I don't need an answer

411
00:34:34,493 --> 00:34:38,593
転がした車窓と情景 動きは未だ不明
The scenery passing by the car window; movement is still unknown

412
00:34:38,793 --> 00:34:43,493
邪魔くさくって色付いた 迷い込んだニャンニャンニャン
It's annoying and colorful, wandered in, meow meow meow

413
00:34:43,693 --> 00:34:48,193
追い立てて落とした財布 誰か見ませんでしたか
The wallet I dropped while being chased; has anyone seen it?

414
00:34:48,393 --> 00:34:53,293
馬鹿みたいに付いてないね 茶化してよはいはいした
I'm stupidly out of luck, aren't I? Make fun of me, yeah yeah I did it

415
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:59,093
予報をもう一丁 漫画みたいな喧嘩しようぜ
One more forecast; let's have a fight like something out of a manga

416
00:35:00,105 --> 00:35:02,605
...かわせて おためしで
...try exchanging them

417
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:08,105
ゼロとボロの 分類さえできない 街を
In a city where you can't even tell the difference between zero and junk

418
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:12,205
抜け出したって 互いに笑い合う
Even if we escape, we'll laugh together

419
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:16,905
メロウなエンディング
A mellow ending

420
00:35:19,505 --> 00:35:23,105
それは鼓動 切なさを鳴らすもの
That's a heartbeat, something that rings out sadness

421
00:35:23,905 --> 00:35:27,605
追いかけた途端に 見失っちゃうの
The moment I chase it, I lose sight of it

422
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:32,205
きっと永遠が どっかにあるんだと
Surely eternity is out there somewhere

423
00:35:32,905 --> 00:35:37,605
明後日を 探し回るのも 悪くはないでしょう
Searching for the day after tomorrow isn't so bad, right?

424
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:42,605
思い出が どっかに消えた朝より
Rather than a morning where memories have vanished somewhere

425
00:35:43,305 --> 00:35:47,105
こんな夜の方が まだマシさ
A night like this is much better

426
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:51,305
肺に睡蓮 遠くのサイレン
Water lilies in my lungs, a distant siren

427
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:55,905
響き合う境界線
Resonating boundaries

428
00:35:56,605 --> 00:36:00,305
愛し合う様に 喧嘩しようぜ
Let's fight as if we love each other

429
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:05,605
遣る瀬無さ 引っ下げて
Carrying this helplessness with us

430
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:10,005
肺に睡蓮 遠くのサイレン
Water lilies in my lungs, a distant siren

431
00:36:10,605 --> 00:36:14,705
響き合う境界線
Resonating boundaries

432
00:36:15,305 --> 00:36:18,905
愛し合う様に 喧嘩しようぜ
Let's fight as if we love each other

433
00:36:19,505 --> 00:36:24,105
遣る瀬無さ 引っ下げて
Carrying this helplessness with us

434
00:36:26,805 --> 00:36:30,605
たった一瞬の この煌めきを
This radiance of just a single moment

435
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:35,305
食べ尽くそう 二人でくたばるまで
Let's devour it until we both drop dead

436
00:36:35,805 --> 00:36:39,605
そして鼓動 僕らにノリを
And may the heartbeat give us a rhythm

437
00:36:40,305 --> 00:36:44,905
まだ行こう 誰も追いつけないくらいのスピードで
Let's keep going, at a speed no one can catch up to

438
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:49,205
それは鼓動 切なさを鳴らすもの
That's a heartbeat, something that rings out sadness

439
00:36:49,905 --> 00:36:53,705
追いかけた途端に 見失っちゃうの
The moment I chase it, I lose sight of it

440
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:58,205
きっと永遠が どっかにあるんだと
Surely eternity is out there somewhere

441
00:36:58,805 --> 00:37:03,605
明後日を 探し回るのも 悪くはないでしょう
Searching for the day after tomorrow isn't so bad, right?

442
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:08,605
稲妻の様に 生きてたいだけ
I just want to live like a bolt of lightning

443
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:13,605
お前はどうした 返事はいらない
What about you? I don't need an answer

444
00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:44,605
みんな行くよー！
Everyone, let's go!

445
00:37:48,105 --> 00:37:51,605
破滅の純情
作詞：西直紀 / 作曲：コモリタミノル
Pure Heart of Destruction
Lyrics: Naoki Nishi / Composition: Minoru Komorita

446
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:53,105
燃え上がるガレキの上に立っている
Standing atop the burning rubble

447
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:58,605
いつからか 何故なのか 忘れたけど
I've forgotten since when or why

448
00:38:00,705 --> 00:38:04,605
息継ぎもできない 炎の中では
Inside the flames where I can't even catch my breath

449
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:10,605
探しても 見つけても 意味がないよ
There's no point in searching or finding

450
00:38:12,405 --> 00:38:17,105
壊せ 超えろ 過去のエクスタシー
Destroy and transcend the ecstasy of the past

451
00:38:17,705 --> 00:38:22,605
たとえ最悪でも 未来を選べ
Even if it's the worst, choose the future

452
00:38:24,505 --> 00:38:25,305
行くよ！
Here we go!

453
00:38:25,605 --> 00:38:27,605
ギリギリまで Love Forever
Until the very limit, Love Forever

454
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,605
悶えるほど 歌えば
If you sing until you writhe

455
00:38:31,005 --> 00:38:35,905
魂は どろまみれ
Your soul will be covered in mud

456
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,605
それでもまだ 叫べば
If you still keep on screaming

457
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:44,105
生きることに 滾れば
If you seethe with the will to live

458
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:51,105
その先は 破滅の純情
Beyond that is the pure heart of destruction

459
00:38:57,205 --> 00:39:01,905
生き抜ける狂気を胸に走ってる
Running with the madness to survive in my heart

460
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:07,605
いつまでか 何故なのか 知らないけど
I don't know until when or why

461
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:13,305
瞬きもできない 速度の中では
Inside the speed where I can't even blink

462
00:39:14,005 --> 00:39:19,605
喚いても 嘆いても 虚しいだけ
It's just empty, no matter how much you cry out or grieve

463
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:25,605
唸れ 弾け ヒトのエモーション
Roar and burst, human emotion

464
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:31,605
たとえ最低でも 自分を選べ
Even if it's the lowest, choose yourself

465
00:39:32,505 --> 00:39:33,305
飛ぶよ！
We're flying!

466
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:35,905
ズタズタまで Love Forever
Until you're in tatters, Love Forever

467
00:39:36,305 --> 00:39:39,105
震えるほど 踊れば
If you dance until you tremble

468
00:39:39,405 --> 00:39:44,305
魂は むつぶれだし
Your soul begins to crumble

469
00:39:45,105 --> 00:39:47,905
それでもまだ 動けば
If you still keep on moving

470
00:39:48,105 --> 00:39:52,105
光る空に 届けば
If you reach the shining sky

471
00:39:52,505 --> 00:39:56,605
その先は 破滅の純情
Beyond that is the pure heart of destruction

472
00:39:57,105 --> 00:40:00,105
純情
Pure heart

473
00:40:00,217 --> 00:40:01,417
純情
Pure heart

474
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:03,517
純情
Pure heart

475
00:40:04,517 --> 00:40:05,617
純情
Pure heart

476
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:07,717
純情
Pure heart

477
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:09,717
純情
Pure heart

478
00:40:14,617 --> 00:40:29,117
ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！
Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi!

479
00:40:29,617 --> 00:40:30,917
声出して声出してー！
Let's hear your voices!

480
00:40:31,017 --> 00:40:38,117
ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！
Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi!

481
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:43,117
踊れ、歌え、次のサバイバル
Dance, sing, the next survival

482
00:40:43,617 --> 00:40:50,117
守る覚悟でなら地獄を進め
If you're prepared to protect, proceed through hell

483
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:51,417
好きよ
I love you

484
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:54,117
何回目のラストエバー
How many times has it been 'last ever'?

485
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:59,117
すべてあなた失くせば魂は
If I lose everything to you, my soul will...

486
00:40:59,617 --> 00:41:03,117
乱舞のたち　イェーイ！
Be a sword in a wild dance, yay!

487
00:41:03,217 --> 00:41:08,117
生まれる日に戻れば　消え去る日に眠れば
If I return to the day of birth, if I sleep on the day of fading

488
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:14,117
その先は　微熱の戦場
Beyond that is a battlefield of slight fever

489
00:41:14,217 --> 00:41:16,917
ギリギリまでラストフォーエバー
Until the very limit, last forever

490
00:41:17,117 --> 00:41:21,117
悶えるほど歌えば魂は
If I sing until I writhe, my soul will...

491
00:41:22,117 --> 00:41:26,117
輪廻に咲き　イェーイ！
Bloom in reincarnation, yay!

492
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:31,117
それでもまだ叫べば　生きることに滾れば
If I still shout, if I seethe with living

493
00:41:31,217 --> 00:41:37,117
その先は　破滅の純情
Beyond that is the pure heart of destruction

494
00:41:37,617 --> 00:41:41,617
ああ　たまらないの、ベイビー
Ah, I can't stand it, baby

495
00:41:42,617 --> 00:41:45,617
許してあげるわ
I will forgive you

496
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:51,117
カオスの純情
Pure heart of chaos

497
00:41:52,117 --> 00:41:56,117
イェーイ！
Yay!

498
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:09,117
生まれたてのドキドキを響かせよう
Let's make our fresh heart-throbs resound

覚えてるかな、最初の歌
Do you remember the first song?

504
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:38,117
私　声が震えていたんだ　少し
My voice was trembling a little bit

505
00:42:38,617 --> 00:42:43,117
あの日から続く未来は
The future that continues from that day

506
00:42:43,617 --> 00:42:47,117
みんなと掴んだ今日だよ
Is the today we grasped together

507

もっともっともっともっと　加速するハート
More, more, more, more, an accelerating heart

I'm right here, because you found me

514

君に会いたくてやって来たんだ　みんなで歌おう
I came here because I wanted to see you
Let's all sing together

届けたいのは、君に笑顔
What I want to deliver to you is a smile

520
00:43:56,117 --> 00:44:01,117
理想の高さに　悔しくて
The height of ideals made me frustrated

521
00:44:01,617 --> 00:44:05,617
みんなと泣いた夜もあったね
There were nights I cried with everyone, weren't there?

522

もっともっともっともっと　加速するハート

今をわがままもいいでしょ
Is it okay to be selfish for now?

535
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:07,629
だって楽しすぎて戻れない
Because it's so much fun, I can't go back

536
00:45:08,629 --> 00:45:12,829
輝くステージでもっともっと
On this shining stage, more and more...

537

お願いずっと
...please, forever!

538
00:45:14,529 --> 00:45:15,629
僕が主役でもいいですか？
Is it okay if I'm the lead?

539
00:45:15,729 --> 00:45:21,129

今も今も悩みはあるけど
Even now, I still have worries, but...

546
00:45:45,129 --> 00:45:49,129
ここにいるよ私 ここにいるよ
I am here, I am right here

00:49:19,129 --> 00:49:24,629
これ以外にはね、おしおママが出してくれた本の中で…
Besides this, in the book Oshio-mama released...

587
00:49:32,129 --> 00:49:37,129
そして、みんな覚えてる？5月とか6月くらいにさ、
「手裏剣のネックレスがほしい」って言ってたでしょ？
And, does everyone remember? Around May or June,
you all said you wanted a shuriken necklace, right?

588
00:49:38,129 --> 00:49:42,129
それを今回叶えました！ドーン！
I've made that a reality this time! Boom!

589
00:49:47,129 --> 00:49:52,129
全部セット特典はですね、箔押し複製サイン入りの…
The complete set bonus is a foil-stamped replica signature...

590
00:49:53,129 --> 00:49:59,129
しかもちょっとさっきの泣いているお顔から
ちょっとはにかんで笑っているというね！
...and it's a bit of a shy smile,
different from that crying face earlier!

591
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:01,441
なのかなという感じです。
...is what I guess it's like.

592
00:50:01,473 --> 00:50:05,289
こちらね、全部セットの特典でございます。全部セット。
This is the bonus for the full set. The full set.

593
00:50:05,422 --> 00:50:09,258
そしてですね、みんな気になっているであろうね、手裏剣じゃないですけど、
And then, as for what everyone is probably curious about, it's not a shuriken, but...

594
00:50:09,258 --> 00:50:13,378
天使の輪っかのアクセサリー。みんなとね約束したので、
the angel's halo accessory. I promised everyone,

595
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:15,680
今回ね、ちょっと無理を言って出してもらいました！
so this time, I asked them to make it happen, even if it was a bit much!

596
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,964
ドどん！
Ta-da!

597
00:50:16,964 --> 00:50:20,151
こちらです！ネックレス＆タッセルチャーム。
Here it is! Necklace & Tassel Charm.

598
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:24,155
えっとね、これチャームだけでも確かね、あの買えるはずなので、
Um, I believe you can buy just the charm too,

599
00:50:24,155 --> 00:50:27,842
あの僕はね、あの僕がオタクだったら、うーん、
so if it were me, if I were a fan, um,

600
00:50:27,842 --> 00:50:31,395
ネックレスは買えないけど、でもちょっとした手裏剣が欲しいと思った時にね、
I might not be able to buy the necklace, but if I wanted a little shuriken,

601
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:35,950
あの買えるようなものも欲しいなと思ってチャームも用意しました。みんなつけてくれる？
I wanted something affordable too, so I prepared a charm. Will everyone wear it?

602
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:41,422
鞄とかさ。しかもね、ゴールドとシルバーでね、ちゃんとね。これどっちがいいかなって悩んだんだけど、
On your bags and stuff. Also, it comes in both gold and silver. I was torn on which one would be better,

603
00:50:41,422 --> 00:50:44,892
やっぱ人によって似合うの違うからさ、両方作ってもらいました。
but since different things look good on different people, I had them make both.

604
00:50:44,892 --> 00:50:48,479
めちゃめちゃ無理を言って。ありがとうございます、本当に。
I really pushed for it. Thank you so much, seriously.

605
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:51,498
よし、そして、ドどん！
Alright, and next, ta-da!

606
00:50:51,498 --> 00:50:53,217
あ、ドどん。
Ah, ta-da.

607
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:57,488
はい、こちらがですね、あのグッズとして付いてくるタペストリーでございます。
Yes, here is the tapestry that comes with the goods.

608
00:50:57,488 --> 00:51:03,644
いや〜もうさ、僕のタペストリー全部持っているっていう人はさ、もう部屋中かなたになってんじゃない？
Wow... I mean, people who have all my tapestries, isn't your room just full of Kanata by now?

609
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:08,716
僕もサンプルでね、あのグッズいつも頂いているんですけど、それをね、全部ココの部屋にね、
I always receive samples of the goods, and I give them all to Coco for her room,

610
00:51:08,716 --> 00:51:13,254
あのあげてるから、ココの部屋がちょっと平民の部屋みたいになってるんだけどさ。
so Coco's room is starting to look like a fan's room.

611
00:51:13,254 --> 00:51:18,142
あの今回のこれもね、あの飾るので、そうするとね、
I'll be displaying this one too, which means...

612
00:51:18,142 --> 00:51:21,946
あの間接的に桐生ココとお揃いということに皆さんなりますので、
you'll all indirectly be matching with Kiryu Coco.

613
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:26,684
ぜひぜひこちらの、おしお先生の素敵なイラスト飾ってください。という感じで、
So please, please display this lovely illustration by Oshio-sensei. And with that,

614
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:28,669
という感じでオッケーかな？はい。これでオッケーですね。
is that all? Yes. That's it.

615
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:32,056
えーと、ではですね、えーと、あと、もうこれラストスパート、
Um, well then, um, we're in the final stretch now,

616
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:34,642
あと2曲になりました。
with only two songs left.

617
00:51:34,642 --> 00:51:38,395
みんなへのね、気持ちをいっぱい込めて歌いたいと思います。
I want to sing with all my feelings for everyone.

618
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:41,649
えー、それでは、あ、マイクもね、後で頂いてと。
Well then, oh, I'll get my mic later too.

619
00:51:41,649 --> 00:51:47,154
それでは、最後の曲、聴いてください。『炎』。
And now, please listen to the final song: "Homura".

620
00:52:18,562 --> 00:52:24,552
さよなら ありがとう 声の限り
Goodbye, thank you, with all my voice

621
00:52:24,552 --> 00:52:30,558
悲しみよりもっと大事なこと
Something more important than sadness

622
00:52:30,558 --> 00:52:36,564
去りゆく背中に 伝えたい
I want to tell your departing back

623
00:52:36,564 --> 00:52:42,570
ぬくもりと痛みに 間に合うように
So I can make it in time with warmth and pain

624
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:48,576
このまま続くと思っていた
I thought it would continue like this

625
00:52:48,576 --> 00:52:56,584
僕らの明日を描いていた
I was drawing our tomorrow

626
00:52:56,584 --> 00:53:02,590
呼び合っていた 光がまだ
The light that was calling out to each other still...

627
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:08,596
胸の奥に熱いのに
...is hot deep in my chest

628
00:53:08,596 --> 00:53:14,602
僕たちは燃え盛る 旅の途中で出会い
We met in the middle of a blazing journey

629
00:53:14,602 --> 00:53:20,608
手を取りそして離した 未来のために
Took hands and then let go, for the sake of the future

630
00:53:20,608 --> 00:53:26,614
夢が一つ叶うたび 僕は君を想うだろう
Every time a dream comes true, I will probably think of you

631
00:53:26,614 --> 00:53:32,620
強くなりたいと願い 泣いた
I wished to become strong and cried

632
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:38,626
決意を 餞に
My determination as a parting gift

633
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:58,630
懐かしい思いに 囚われたり
Being trapped in nostalgic feelings

634
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:04,636
残酷な世界に 泣き叫んで
Crying out in this cruel world

635
00:54:04,636 --> 00:54:10,642
大人になるほど 増えて行く
The more I become an adult, the more they increase

636
00:54:10,642 --> 00:54:16,648
もう何一つだって 失いたくない
I don't want to lose even one more thing

637
00:54:16,648 --> 00:54:22,654
悲しみに呑まれ 落ちてしまえば
If I am swallowed by sadness and fall

638
00:54:22,654 --> 00:54:30,662
痛みを感じなくなるけれど
I won't feel pain anymore, but...

639
00:54:30,662 --> 00:54:36,668
君の言葉 君の願い
...your words, your wish...

640
00:54:36,668 --> 00:54:42,674
僕は守り抜くと 誓ったんだ
...I swore that I would protect them to the end

641
00:54:56,688 --> 00:55:00,141
音を立てて 崩れ落ちて行く
Noisily crumbling away

642
00:55:00,653 --> 00:55:02,653
音を立てて 崩れ落ちてゆく
With a roar, it all comes crumbling down

643
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:13,153
一つだけの かけがえのない世界
This one and only, irreplaceable world

644
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:30,153
手を伸ばし 抱き止めた 激しい光の束
I reached out and held tight to a fierce bundle of light

645
00:55:30,653 --> 00:55:36,153
輝いて消えてった 未来のために
It shone and then vanished, for the sake of the future

646
00:55:36,653 --> 00:55:44,353
託された幸せと 約束を越えて行く
I'll go beyond the happiness entrusted to me and the promise we made

647
00:55:44,653 --> 00:55:50,153
振り返らずに進むから
Because I will move forward without looking back

648
00:55:50,653 --> 00:55:56,353
前だけ向いて叫ぶから
Because I will look only ahead and scream

649
00:55:56,653 --> 00:56:01,153
心に炎を灯して
With a flame lit in my heart

650
00:56:01,453 --> 00:56:10,153
遠い未来まで……
To the distant future...

651
00:56:42,453 --> 00:56:48,153
強くなれる理由を知った
I've found the reason to be strong

652
00:56:48,653 --> 00:56:54,153
僕を連れて進め
Take me with you and move forward

653
00:56:53,153 --> 00:57:00,153
紅蓮華
作詞：LiSA 作曲：草野華余子
Gurenge
Lyrics: LiSA  Composition: Kayoko Kusano

654
00:57:00,453 --> 00:57:06,153
泥だらけの走馬灯に酔う
Drunk on a mud-covered revolving lantern of memories

655
00:57:06,553 --> 00:57:11,153
こわばる心 震える手は
My heart stiffens, my hands tremble

656
00:57:11,253 --> 00:57:14,153
掴みたいものがある それだけさ
There's something I want to grasp, that's all

657
00:57:14,653 --> 00:57:20,653
夜の匂いに空睨んでも
Even if I glare at the sky in the scent of the night

658
00:57:20,753 --> 00:57:28,353
変わっていけるのは自分自身だけ それだけさ
The only thing that can change is myself, that's all

659
00:57:28,553 --> 00:57:34,153
強くなれる理由を知った
I've found the reason to be strong

660
00:57:34,653 --> 00:57:41,153
僕を連れて進め
Take me with you and move forward

661
00:57:41,653 --> 00:57:50,153
どうしたって！消せない夢も 止まれない今も
No matter what! A dream that won't fade, a present that won't stop

662
00:57:50,253 --> 00:57:56,153
誰かのために強くなれるなら
If I can become strong for someone's sake

663
00:57:56,553 --> 00:58:01,153
ありがとう 悲しみよ
Thank you, sadness

664
00:58:01,453 --> 00:58:07,153
世界に打ちのめされて 負ける意味を知った
Beaten down by the world, I learned the meaning of defeat

665
00:58:07,553 --> 00:58:13,153
紅蓮の華よ咲き誇れ！ 運命を照らして
Gurenge, bloom in full! Shine on my destiny

666
00:58:14,553 --> 00:58:21,153
イナビカリの雑音が耳を刺す
The noise of the lightning strikes pierces my ears

667
00:58:21,653 --> 00:58:29,353
戸惑う心 優しいだけじゃ守れないものがある？ わかってるけど
My bewildered heart, are there things I can't protect just by being kind? I know that, but...

668
00:58:29,653 --> 00:58:32,253
水面下で絡まる善悪
Good and evil tangled below the surface

669
00:58:32,353 --> 00:58:34,653
透けて見える偽善に天罰
Divine punishment for the hypocrisy seen through it

670
00:58:34,753 --> 00:58:36,653
Tell me why, Tell me why, Tell me why, Tell me why...

671
00:58:36,753 --> 00:58:37,853
I don't need you!

672
00:58:37,953 --> 00:58:41,353
逸材の花より 挑み続け咲いた一輪が美しい
More than a gifted flower, the one that kept challenging to bloom is beautiful

673
00:58:41,653 --> 00:58:50,353
乱暴に敷き詰められた トゲだらけの道も 本気の僕だけに現れるから 乗り越えてみせるよ
The path roughly paved with thorns appears only to the serious me, so I'll show you I can overcome it

674
00:58:50,653 --> 00:58:56,353
簡単に片付けられた 守れなかった夢も
Easily dismissed, even the dreams I couldn't protect

675
00:58:56,653 --> 00:59:08,653
紅蓮の心臓に根を生やし この血に宿ってる
Take root in my crimson heart, and dwell in this blood

676
00:59:22,653 --> 00:59:30,153
人知れず儚い 散りゆく結末
A secret, fleeting, scattering end

677
00:59:30,653 --> 00:59:36,353
無情に破れた 悲鳴の風吹く
Heartlessly torn, the wind of screams blows

678
00:59:36,653 --> 00:59:43,353
誰かの笑い声 誰かの泣き声
Someone's laughter, someone's crying

679
00:59:43,653 --> 00:59:48,353
誰もが幸せを願ってる
Everyone is wishing for happiness

680
00:59:48,653 --> 01:00:00,153
どうしたって！消せない夢も 止まれない今も 誰かのために強くなれるなら
No matter what! A dream that won't fade, a present that won't stop, if I can become strong for someone's sake

681
01:00:00,565 --> 01:00:02,965
悲しみよ
Oh, sadness...

682
01:00:04,565 --> 01:00:06,465
世界に打ちのめされて
Beaten down by the world,

683
01:00:06,465 --> 01:00:08,365
負ける意味を知った
I learned the meaning of defeat.

684
01:00:08,565 --> 01:00:10,665
紅蓮の華よ
Oh crimson lotus flower,

685
01:00:10,765 --> 01:00:12,565
咲き誇れ
Bloom in full glory,

686
01:00:12,865 --> 01:00:13,965
運命を
Illuminate

687
01:00:14,265 --> 01:00:22,665
照らして
destiny.

688
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:25,965
運命を照らして
Illuminate destiny.

689
01:00:30,465 --> 01:00:33,365
