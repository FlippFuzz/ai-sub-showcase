Piece of the Wilderness
Lyrics: Kazuya Sawada | Composition: Yoko Kanno

11
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:51,348
何を見ているの
What are you looking at...

12
00:05:51,348 --> 00:05:58,648
どこまでも澄んだ瞳で
...with eyes as clear as can be?

13
00:05:59,248 --> 00:06:06,348
二人だけが触れる世界で
In a world that only the two of us can touch,

14
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:14,348
きっと全てが今始まるから
surely everything is beginning now.

15
00:06:16,148 --> 00:06:23,248
君に会うために生まれたこと
That I was born to meet you...

16
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:30,148
伝えたい想いだ
...is the feeling I want to convey.

17
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:34,948
涼やかな風も胸誘う
A cool breeze also beckons to my heart,

18
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:39,948
視線も全部
and my gaze, all of it...

19
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:47,448
ヒリヒリする声になるのさ　ずっと
...becomes a voice that tingles, always.

20
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:54,148
君を側に感じる
I feel you by my side.

21
00:06:54,148 --> 00:07:01,248
濁りもない奇跡　持ち場は
In this clear moment of a miracle, my post is...

22
00:07:01,448 --> 00:07:08,548
振り返るものなんてない
There's nothing to look back on.

23
00:07:08,548 --> 00:07:16,248
二人きり未来さえ飛べるんだ
Just the two of us, we can even fly to the future.

24
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:42,148
どこへ行くの小さな
Where are you going?

25
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:51,448
自分に涙あふれるけど走り出せる
Tears overflow for my small self, but I can start running.

26
00:07:53,748 --> 00:08:00,148
もしはぐれたら体ごと
If we get separated, with my whole body...

27
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:07,148
散ってみせる
...I'll show you I can bloom.

28
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:13,448
花びら舞った一夜の
Taking the form of the petals...

29
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:24,448
姿になって君の愛も貯めてサービスするよ　ずっと
...that danced for one night, I'll store up your love and give it back, always.

30
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:29,848
君はそう微笑む
You smile like that.

31
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:37,948
汚されない奇跡が
The miracle that won't be tainted...

32

二人きり未来へと飛ぶんだ
Just the two of us, we'll fly toward the future.

34

出会えた
Meeting you...

35
00:09:04,148 --> 00:09:11,448
奇跡に　もう息が止まりそうだよ
...was a miracle, it almost takes my breath away.

36
00:09:12,148 --> 00:09:18,548
繋いだ
In those joined...

37
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:25,648
その手に　少し強くなれる気がする
...hands, I feel like I can become a little stronger.

38
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:32,948
出会えた
Meeting you...

39
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:40,148
奇跡に　もう息が止まりそうだよ
...was a miracle, it almost takes my breath away.

Tomorrow...

41

未来も　ただどうしようもなく好きだよ

ピースサイン
作詞・作曲：米津玄師
Peace Sign
Lyrics & Composition: Kenshi Yonezu

44
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:24,456
いつか僕らの上をすれすれに通り過ぎて行ったあの飛行機を
I remember that airplane that once passed
right above our heads

45
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:29,423
不思議なくらいに覚えてる　意味もないのに何故か
It's strange how I remember it,
even though there's no reason why

46
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:34,056
不甲斐なくて泣いた日の夜に　ただ強くなりたいと願ってた
On the night I cried from feeling pathetic,
I only wished to become stronger

47
00:10:34,356 --> 00:10:38,856
そのために必要な勇気を　探し求めていた
I was searching for the courage
I needed to do that

48
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:43,923
残酷な運命が定まってるとして
Even if a cruel fate is already decided

49
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:48,889
それがいつの日か僕の前に現れるとして
And if it were to appear before me someday

50
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:53,689
ただ一瞬、この一瞬、息ができないなら
If for just an instant, this instant,
I can't even breathe

51
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:59,056
どうでもいいと思えた　その心を
Then I won't care about anything else,
and that heart...

52
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:03,023
もう一度　遠くへ行け　遠くへ行け
Go further once more, go further!

53
00:11:03,223 --> 00:11:09,623
僕の中で誰かが歌う　どうしようもないほど熱烈に
Someone is singing inside of me
with an uncontrollable passion

54
00:11:10,523 --> 00:11:15,689
いつだって目を腫らした君が　二度と悲しまないように笑える
So that you, who always has swollen eyes,
can smile and never be sad again

55
00:11:16,056 --> 00:11:19,489
そんなヒーローになるための歌
This is a song to become that kind of hero

56
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:22,589
さらば掲げろ　ピースサイン
So, farewell, hold up a peace sign

57
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:25,589
転がっていくストーリーを
To this story as it rolls along

58
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:38,789
守りたいだなんて言えるほど　君が弱くはないの分かってた
I knew you weren't weak enough
for me to say I wanted to protect you

59
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:43,789
それ以上に僕は弱くてさ　君が大事だったんだ
But I was even weaker than that,
and you were important to me

60
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:48,889
独りで生きてくんだなんてさ　口を突いて叫んだあの日から
Since the day I blurted out
that I would live on my own

61
00:11:49,223 --> 00:11:53,623
変わっていく僕を笑えばいい　独りが怖い僕を
You can laugh at how I've changed,
at how I'm afraid of being alone

62
00:11:54,356 --> 00:11:58,789
蹴飛ばして噛み付いて息もできなくて
Kicking, biting, and unable to breathe

63
00:11:59,123 --> 00:12:03,589
騒ぐ頭とお腹の奥がぐしゃぐしゃになったって
Even if my racing head
and the pit of my stomach become a mess

64
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:08,589
てらいも外聞も消えてしまうくらいに
To the point where bashfulness
and reputation both disappear

65
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:13,689
今は触っていたいんだ　君の心に
Right now, I want to be touching your heart

66
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:17,623
僕たちはきっといつか遠く離れた
We will surely reach out someday

67
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:23,889
太陽にすら手が届いて　夜明け前を手に入れて笑おう
Even to the distant sun,
and let's laugh as we seize the dawn

68
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:29,589
そうやって青く燃える色に染まり　おぼろげな街の向こうへ
Stained in a blue burning color,
beyond the hazy city

69
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:33,489
手を繋いで走っていけるはずだ
We should be able to run, holding hands

70
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:38,956
君と未来を盗み描く　捻りのないストーリーを
Stealing a glimpse of the future with you,
a story with no twists

71
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:53,623
瘡蓋だらけ荒れくれた日々が　削り削られ擦り切れた今が
Days full of scabs and roughness,
a present that's been chipped and worn away

72
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:58,723
君の言葉で蘇る　鮮やかにも現れていく
They're revived by your words,
appearing vividly before me

73
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:03,489
蛹のままで眠る魂を　食べかけのまま捨てたあの夢を
The soul sleeping in its cocoon,
the dream I threw away half-eaten

74
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:07,423
もう一度取り戻せ
Take them back once more!

75
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:25,589
Oh oh oh oh oh oh...

76
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:30,423
もう一度　遠くへ行け　遠くへ行け
Go further once more, go further!

77
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:35,489
僕の中で誰かが歌う　どうしようもないほど熱烈に
Someone is singing inside of me
with an uncontrollable passion

78
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:41,356
いつだって目を腫らした君が　二度と悲しまないように笑える
So that you, who always has swollen eyes,
can smile and never be sad again

79
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:45,056
そんなヒーローになるための歌
This is a song to become that kind of hero

80
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:48,356
さらば掲げろ　ピースサイン
So, farewell, hold up a peace sign

81
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:51,123
転がっていくストーリーを
To this story as it rolls along

82
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:56,056
君と未来を盗み描く　捻りのないストーリーを
Stealing a glimpse of the future with you,
a story with no twists

83
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:11,789
考えたってわからないし　青空の下君を待った
Thinking about it won't help me understand,
I waited for you under the blue sky

84
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:16,223
風が吹いた正午　昼下がりを抜け出す想像
At noon when the wind blew,
imagining escaping the early afternoon

85
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:20,956
ねぇ、これからどうなるんだろうね　進め方教わらないんだよ
Hey, what will happen from now on?
I wasn't taught how to move forward

86
00:14:21,256 --> 00:14:23,889
君の目を見た　何も言えず僕は歩いた
I looked into your eyes,
and I walked on without saying a word

87
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:28,023
だから僕は音楽を辞めた
作詞・作曲：n-buna
That's Why I Gave Up on Music
Lyrics & Composition: n-buna

88
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:43,623
考えたってわからないし　青春なんてつまらないし
Thinking about it won't help me understand,
and youth is just boring anyway

89
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:47,056
辞めたはずのピアノ　机を弾く癖が抜けない
The piano I was supposed to have quit,
I can't stop the habit of playing on my desk

90
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:51,789
ねぇ、将来何してるだろうね　音楽はしてないといいな
Hey, I wonder what I'll be doing in the future?
I hope I'm not doing music

91
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:54,623
困らないでよ　心
Don't be troubled, my heart

92
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:59,023
喉の奥に
In the back of my throat

93
00:15:00,071 --> 00:15:02,221
バツを引いても どうしても消えなかった
Even if I cross it out, it just won't disappear.

94
00:15:02,221 --> 00:15:06,571
今更なんだから何も 思い出すな
It's too late now, so don't remember a thing.

95
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:13,271
間違ってるんだよ わかってないよ あんたら人間も
You're wrong, you don't understand, you humans too.

96
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:17,071
本当も愛も世界も 苦しさも人生も どうでもいいよ
Truth, love, the world, pain, and life—I don't care about any of it.

97
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:20,571
正しいかどうか知りたいのだって 防衛本能だ
Even wanting to know if it's right is just a defense instinct.

98
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:24,071
考えたんだ あんたのせいで
I thought about it, because of you.

99
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,871
考えたってわからないが 本当に年老いたくないんだ
I think and think but I don't know, I really don't want to get old.

100
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:46,071
いつか死んだって思うだけで 胸が空っぽになるんだ
Just thinking that I'll die someday makes my heart feel empty.

101
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:49,871
将来何してるだろうって 大人になったらわかったよ
I wondered what I'd be doing in the future, and I found out once I became an adult.

102
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:53,571
何もしてないさ
I'm doing nothing at all.

103
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:57,671
幸せな顔した人が
Those people with happy faces—

104
00:15:57,671 --> 00:16:00,871
憎いのはどう割り切ったらいいんだ
How should I come to terms with hating them?

105
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:04,571
満たされない頭の奥の
Deep inside my unsatisfied head,

106
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:08,571
化け物みたいだ 劣等感
this sense of inferiority is like a monster.

107
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:14,271
間違ってないよな 何だかんだ あんたら人間だ
I'm not wrong, right? One way or another, you're all humans.

108
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:18,371
愛も救いも優しさも 根拠がないなんて 君が悪いよ
Love, salvation, and kindness having no basis—it's your fault.

109
00:16:18,371 --> 00:16:22,071
ラブソングなんかが 痛いのだって防衛本能だ
Even love songs hurting is just a defense instinct.

110
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:25,071
どうでもいいか あんたのせいで
Is it whatever? Because of you.

111
00:16:39,871 --> 00:16:42,171
考えたってわからないし
I think and think but I don't know,

112
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:44,271
生きてるだけでも苦しいし
and even just living is painful.

113
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,371
音楽とかもうわかんないし
I don't even understand music anymore,

114
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:48,571
歌詞とか適当でもいいよ
so the lyrics can be whatever.

115
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:53,571
どうでもいいんだ
I don't care about anything.

116
00:16:55,271 --> 00:16:57,571
間違ってないだろ
I'm not wrong, right?

117
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:00,871
間違ってないよな
I'm not wrong, right?

118
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:05,571
間違ってないよな
I'm not wrong, right?

119
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:19,271
間違ってるんだよ わかってんだ あんたら人間も
You're wrong, I know it, you humans too.

120
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:23,071
本当も救いも優しさも 人生もどうでもいいんだ
Truth, salvation, kindness, and life—I don't care about any of it.

121
00:17:23,071 --> 00:17:27,171
正しい答えが言えないの だって防衛本能だ
Being unable to give the right answer is just a defense instinct.

122
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,571
どうでもいいや あんたのせいで
I don't care, because of you.

123
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:50,071
僕だって信念があった 今じゃゴミみたいな思いだ
I had convictions too; now they're thoughts like trash.

124
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:52,571
何度でも君を書いた
I wrote about you over and over.

125
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,271
売れることこそが どうでもよかったんだ
Selling well didn't matter to me at all.

126
00:17:56,271 --> 00:17:59,071
本当だ 本当なんだ 昔はそうだった
It's true, it really is true; it used to be like that.

127
00:18:02,271 --> 00:18:05,271
だから僕は
That's why I...

128
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:09,571
だから僕は音楽を辞めた
That's why I quit music.

129
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:20,671
今なんじゃない？
Isn't it now?

130
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:23,271
メラメラとたぎれ
Burn, burn brightly.

131
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:26,571
眠っているだけの正義
The justice that was just sleeping—

132
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:29,071
こんな僕も
even someone like me

133
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:32,871
君のヒーローになりたいのさ
wants to be your hero.

134
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:46,071
Mela!

135
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:50,571
かっこいい君には
To the cool you,

136
00:18:50,571 --> 00:18:53,871
僕じゃ頼りないのかなんて
I wonder if I'm unreliable.

137
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:57,071
そりゃそうだよな だって
That's only natural, because

138
00:18:57,071 --> 00:19:00,571
今もこうして迷ってる
even now, I'm lost like this.

139
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:05,571
手を取ってくれないか
Won't you take my hand?

140
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:09,071
ギブアンドテイクさ
It's give and take.

141
00:19:09,071 --> 00:19:14,371
君が僕のヒーローだったように
Just like you were my hero.

142
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:16,871
今なんじゃない？
Isn't it now?

143
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:19,271
メラメラとたぎる
Burning brightly,

144
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:22,571
こんな僕にも潜む正義が
the justice hidden even in me,

145
00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:25,671
どうしようもない衝動に駆られて
driven by an uncontrollable impulse,

146
00:19:25,671 --> 00:19:29,271
ほら気付けば手を握っている
look, before I knew it, I was holding your hand.

147
00:19:29,271 --> 00:19:32,571
いったい全体 そんなに荷物を
Why on earth are you carrying

148
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,571
背負い込んでどこへ行くの
so much baggage and where are you going?

149
00:19:35,571 --> 00:19:38,871
ねえねえ待って
Hey, hey, wait.

150
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:42,571
僕にちょっと預けてみては？
Why don't you try entrusting a bit to me?

151
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:00,071
信じてばかりの僕と
And me, who only keeps on believing—

152
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:01,846
信じることが怖い君と
With you, who's afraid of believing,

153
00:20:01,846 --> 00:20:03,496
どちらが正しいのかなんて
as for which of us is right,

154
00:20:07,146 --> 00:20:10,546
誰にもわからないさ
nobody can really know.

155
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:12,796
La la la la...

156
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:16,046
僕らだけの世界
A world only for us,

157
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:18,546
Give and take さ
it's all give and take.

158
00:20:18,546 --> 00:20:21,546
補い合えた暁には
Once we can complement each other,

159
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:25,046
同じ夢を見たい
I want us to dream the same dream.

160
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:43,746
君はかっこいいと苦しめて 独りぼっちにさせたのは
Painfully calling you 'cool' and leaving you all alone,

161
00:20:43,746 --> 00:20:48,546
少し僕のせいなんだよな
that was partly my fault, wasn't it?

162
00:20:48,546 --> 00:20:51,546
ごめんね
I'm sorry.

163
00:20:51,546 --> 00:20:55,246
だけど見るべきはリアルだ
But reality is what we must face,

164
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:58,346
今こそ僕が助けるんだ
now it's my turn to save you.

165
00:20:58,346 --> 00:21:02,546
抱えないで 信じて頼ってほしいんだ
Don't hold it all in; I want you to trust and lean on me.

166
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:14,546
今なんじゃない メラメラとたぎる
Isn't it now? Burning and seething,

167
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:18,346
こんな僕にも潜む正義が
even in me, there's a hidden sense of justice.

168
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:21,846
どうしようもない衝動に駆られて
Driven by an uncontrollable urge,

169
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:25,546
ほら気づけば手を握っている
look, before I know it, I'm holding your hand.

170
00:21:25,546 --> 00:21:28,546
放っとけない
I can't leave you be,

171
00:21:28,546 --> 00:21:31,846
そんなに荷物を背負い込んでどこへ行くの
where are you going carrying such a heavy load?

172
00:21:31,846 --> 00:21:38,846
ほんのちょっと 僕にちょっと預けてみては
Just a little, why not let me carry some of it?

173
00:21:38,846 --> 00:21:46,046
こんな僕も君のヒーローになりたいのさ
Someone like me wants to be your hero, too.

174
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:51,846
La la la la...

175
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:25,846
はーい！皆さん！
Hi, everyone!

176
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:28,546
とうとう始まってしまいました！
It's finally begun!

177
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:32,046
天音かなた卒業ライブということでですね
This is Amane Kanata's Graduation Live!

178
00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:37,046
こちら、ハッシュタグがですね
The hashtag for today...

179
00:22:37,046 --> 00:22:40,546
あの #天音かなた卒業ライブ でございますんで

180
00:22:40,546 --> 00:22:43,046
ぜひこちら、よろしくお願いいたします
so please use it to share your thoughts.

181
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:45,346
1曲目に歌った「今夜のヒンス」は
The first song, 'Konya no Hince'...

182
00:22:45,346 --> 00:22:47,846
実は初配信で歌おうか
I was actually torn whether to sing it

183
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:51,246
悩んでいた楽曲だったので
during my very first stream,

184
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,646
ここで歌えて、すごく良かった
so I'm really glad I could sing it here.

185
00:22:53,646 --> 00:22:55,046
ありがとう！
Thank you!

186
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:58,746
小さい頃からね、ヒロインよりヒーローに
Since I was little, I've always wanted to be a hero

187
00:22:58,746 --> 00:23:00,546
なりたーいっていうタイプだったので
rather than a heroine,

188
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:03,446
そういった楽曲をたくさん歌わせていただきました
so I've sung many songs with that theme.

189
00:23:04,846 --> 00:23:07,446
ありがとね、みんな拍手もありがとう！
Thank you, and thanks for the applause too!

190
00:23:07,446 --> 00:23:10,546
次からは、ロックで感情ぶつけていくような歌を
Next, I'll be singing rock songs to let my emotions out.

191
00:23:10,546 --> 00:23:13,246
調節しますんで... あ、マイクがね
I'll adjust... Oh, the mic stand...

192
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:15,246
調節しますんで
I'll adjust it now.

193
00:23:15,246 --> 00:23:18,246
聴いてください、「劣等上等」！
Please listen to 'Bring It On'!

194
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:34,546
Yeah!

195
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:40,046
劣等上等
Bring It On

196
00:23:44,046 --> 00:23:45,046
ヘイ！ヘイ！ヘイ！ヘイ！
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

197
00:23:45,046 --> 00:23:46,546
劣等上等 BRING IT ON!
Inferiority is fine, BRING IT ON!

198
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:48,546
ヘイ！ヘイ！ヘイ！ヘイ！
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

199
00:23:48,546 --> 00:23:50,046
劣等上等 踏み込め
Inferiority is fine, step forward!

200
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:52,046
子供騙しのマセマティカ
Child's play mathematics,

201
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:55,546
バレてんだってそんなんプライドがない
I see through it; there's no pride in that.

202
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:58,046
媚びへつらい お飾りで
Flattery and mere decorations,

203
00:23:58,046 --> 00:24:01,546
髪の毛一本ばかりじゃつまんねー
just a single hair is so boring.

204
00:24:01,546 --> 00:24:04,046
ほらもっと 間違って上等
Look, more mistakes are just fine,

205
00:24:04,046 --> 00:24:07,546
退屈に手をかけて
give boredom a piece of your mind.

206
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,546
ママ、やっぱ私は
Mama, after all, I...

207
00:24:10,546 --> 00:24:13,546
こんなところじゃ終われない
can't let it end in a place like this.

208
00:24:13,546 --> 00:24:16,546
ぬるい敵が震えそう
Weak enemies seem ready to tremble,

209
00:24:16,546 --> 00:24:19,546
ごっこ遊びも芝居もさよなら
goodbye to playing house and acting.

210
00:24:19,546 --> 00:24:22,546
ずっとこのままなんてさ
Staying like this forever is...

211
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:23,546
いらないよ
unnecessary.

212
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,546
だっだっだ あたし大人になる
Da-da-da, I'm becoming an adult,

213
00:24:26,546 --> 00:24:29,546
酸いも甘いも噛み分けて
experiencing both the sour and the sweet.

214
00:24:29,546 --> 00:24:32,546
ぱっぱっぱ 変わる時代
Pa-pa-pa, in this changing era,

215
00:24:32,546 --> 00:24:36,546
悪いことばかりじゃないでしょう
it's not all bad things, is it?

216
00:24:36,546 --> 00:24:41,546
過去も今もすべてを 繋げて歩いていきたいや
Connecting past and present, I want to keep walking.

217
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:46,046
超えろはー
Surpass it all—

218
00:24:47,546 --> 00:24:49,546
ほら 挑発 私達は脳濁
Look, a provocation, our brains are foggy,

219
00:24:49,546 --> 00:24:52,546
緑のアイツにバカかまって
wasting time on that green guy.

220
00:24:52,546 --> 00:24:55,546
さあ どーなっつ いつまでもどうか
Now, donuts, forever and somehow,

221
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:59,046
仰いでよ どこが残念なんですか？
look up, what exactly is so unfortunate?

222
00:25:00,494 --> 00:25:02,394
劣等　上等　やってやろうじゃん
Inferiority? Bring it on! Let's do this.

223
00:25:02,494 --> 00:25:04,294
コンプレックスさえも味方に
Turning even my complexes into allies.

224
00:25:04,394 --> 00:25:05,494
冗談じゃなく
No joke.

225
00:25:05,594 --> 00:25:07,394
中指立てたくなるような
The kind of situation that makes you want to flip them off...

226
00:25:07,494 --> 00:25:09,194
事情ありすぎて指が足りねえ
...there are so many I don't have enough fingers.

227
00:25:09,294 --> 00:25:11,494
Hands up! What’s up? 最低な
Hands up! What’s up? This terrible...

228
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:12,794
状況を笑え
...situation, just laugh it off!

229
00:25:12,894 --> 00:25:15,194
ママ、パパ、何にもいらない
Mama, Papa, I don't need anything.

230
00:25:15,294 --> 00:25:17,594
欲しがります死ぬまでは
I'll keep wanting things until the day I die.

231
00:25:17,694 --> 00:25:20,094
飛び出せさあ今夜
Let's jump out tonight.

232
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:22,594
たまに投げ出すのもいいから
Because it's okay to give up sometimes.

233
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:24,094
覚悟しておけよ
You'd better be ready.

234
00:25:24,194 --> 00:25:25,694
ダッダッダ
Da-da-da.

235
00:25:25,794 --> 00:25:27,294
僕ら大人になるために
For us to become adults,

236
00:25:27,394 --> 00:25:28,894
散々
Thoroughly,

237
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,394
狙い定めていたい日々に
In the days when I want to keep my aim steady.

238
00:25:30,494 --> 00:25:31,994
燦々
Brilliantly,

239
00:25:31,994 --> 00:25:33,494
ぶちかませ進撃だ
Let it rip, it's an all-out attack!

240
00:25:33,594 --> 00:25:36,594
前を向けよ　さあ今だ
Look forward, now's the time!

241
00:25:36,694 --> 00:25:38,094
いつも
Always,

242
00:25:38,194 --> 00:25:39,594
夢を
Your dreams,

243
00:25:39,694 --> 00:25:41,094
捨てて
Discarding them,

244
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:44,294
行かないで　伝えたいよ
Don't go yet, I want to tell you.

245
00:25:57,094 --> 00:25:59,894
ダッダッダ
Da-da-da.

246
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:02,594
くだらないことばかり譲れない
I won't back down on all these trivial things.

247
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,594
わかるか　私の美学
Do you understand my aesthetic?

248
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:08,594
この場所自負したい
I want to take pride in this place.

249
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:12,094
拳一つが　唯一なんて
With just a single fist as my only...

250
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:15,594
切り札　愚直なんて
...trump card, so straightforward.

251
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:18,594
殻破れさあ
Break out of your shell, now!

252
00:26:18,694 --> 00:26:21,094
一撃 KO だらば
With a single-blow KO!

253
00:26:41,094 --> 00:26:42,594
こんなもんじゃない
It's not just this.

254
00:26:42,694 --> 00:26:44,194
ダッダッダ
Da-da-da.

255
00:26:44,294 --> 00:26:45,594
私大人になる前に
Before I become an adult,

256
00:26:45,694 --> 00:26:48,594
酸いも甘いも噛み分けて今
I've tasted the bitter and the sweet, and now,

257
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:51,594
燦々
Brilliantly,

258
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:54,594
交わる未体験を
This intersecting unknown experience.

259
00:26:54,694 --> 00:26:57,594
前を向けよ　さあ今だ
Look forward, now's the time!

260
00:26:57,694 --> 00:26:59,094
時代
The times,

261
00:26:59,194 --> 00:27:00,594
回って
Keep spinning,

262
00:27:00,694 --> 00:27:02,094
くれよ
For me!

263
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:06,094
全て飲み込んでやるから
Because I'm going to swallow it all up!

264
00:27:12,694 --> 00:27:15,494
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

265
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:18,594
それでは皆様お先に Bye
Well then, everyone, I'll be going now, bye!

266
00:27:18,694 --> 00:27:22,094
フロアが沸き上がりました
The floor has heated up!

267
00:27:47,094 --> 00:27:51,094
ぼくらの16bit戦争 / 作詞・作曲:sasakure.UK
Our 16bit War / Lyrics & Composition: sasakure.UK

268
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,094
どうしてこんなことになったんだ
Why did it turn out like this?

269
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:04,594
誰も教えてはくれないんだ
No one will tell me.

270
00:28:04,694 --> 00:28:06,094
何が正義だ
What is justice?

271
00:28:06,194 --> 00:28:07,594
何が犠牲だ
What is sacrifice?

272
00:28:07,694 --> 00:28:10,094
秩序は僕を裏切った
Order has betrayed me.

273
00:28:13,294 --> 00:28:15,594
始めは小さな穴だったんだ
It was just a small hole at first.

274
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,094
居心地だけは良かったのにな
Even though it felt so comfortable.

275
00:28:18,194 --> 00:28:20,594
プロパガンダと呑み合うダイヤ
Diamonds and propaganda swallowing each other up.

276
00:28:20,694 --> 00:28:23,094
あら次第に巨大化した
Oh, it gradually grew huge.

277
00:28:27,594 --> 00:28:30,094
そう　ライトでデッドな方は水蒸気
Yes, those on the right and dead are water vapor.

278
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:33,094
都合良すぎた大人たちの都合に
To the convenience of adults who were too convenient.

279
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:35,594
ひとつまたひとつ未来は
One by one, the future...

280
00:28:35,694 --> 00:28:38,094
過去を無視した
...ignored the past.

281
00:28:52,594 --> 00:28:55,594
65,535のテトラと
With 65,535 tetras...

282
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:58,594
0次元の理想を抱いていてもなお
...and holding onto 0-dimensional ideals, even still,

283
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:01,094
ひとつまたひとつエレメントは
One by one, the elements...

284
00:29:01,194 --> 00:29:03,594
姿を消した
...disappeared.

285
00:29:08,594 --> 00:29:11,594
僕らの16bit戦争
Our 16bit war.

286
00:29:11,694 --> 00:29:14,594
遂にあの波に飲まれるな
Finally, don't let that wave swallow you up.

287
00:29:14,694 --> 00:29:17,594
残された空間幕末
The remaining space at the end of the curtain.

288
00:29:17,694 --> 00:29:20,594
不覚に弾きさえつきゃしない
I can't even get a shot off in my carelessness.

289
00:29:24,594 --> 00:29:27,594
僕らの16bit戦争
Our 16bit war.

290
00:29:27,694 --> 00:29:30,594
有ると無いとが交差する
Existence and non-existence cross paths.

291
00:29:30,694 --> 00:29:33,094
1と0しか愛せない僕
I, who can only love 1s and 0s,

292
00:29:33,194 --> 00:29:36,594
何を信じて生きればいい
What should I believe in and live for?

293
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:55,594
もっと速い猛火潜り
Diving through even faster raging fires.

294
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:58,594
レジスタすらを一斉掃射
Simultaneously firing upon even the registers.

295
00:29:58,694 --> 00:30:00,094
無言圧力　数の暴力
Silent pressure, the violence of numbers.

296
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:08,649
鋼に打ち込めよトコトコ
Strike it into the steel, tokotoko

297
00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:10,579
虚空の警笛 肩越しに響く駆形
The whistle of the void, a square wave echoing over my shoulder

298
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:13,319
放たれた断末 アルカディアの鐘が鳴る日は
A released death rattle, on the day the bells of Arcadia ring

299
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:15,609
来るのだろうか
Will it ever come?

300
00:30:23,069 --> 00:30:27,069
僕らの16bit戦争
いいね あの波に飲まれるな
Our 16-bit war
Alright, don't let those waves swallow you up

301
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:31,069
残された狂鳴も僕ら
今日も狂い眠りがしない
Even the remaining mad echoes,
We're going crazy again today, unable to sleep

302
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:43,069
僕らの16bit戦争
有ると問え 伍が交差する
Our 16-bit war
Ask if it exists, as the groups cross paths

303
00:30:43,069 --> 00:30:46,819
ビートダウン 尾米との先で
僕は秩序触れられない
Beatdown, at the end of the grain,
I cannot touch order

304
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:58,919
僕らの16bit戦争
世界を敵に回しても
Our 16-bit war
Even if we turn the whole world against us

305
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:03,069
表現できない もどかしさに
晒されることが何より不幸だった
Being exposed to the frustration of being unable to express ourselves was the greatest misfortune of all

306
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:14,369
僕らの16bit戦争
Our 16-bit war

307
00:31:36,589 --> 00:31:37,489
はい。
Yes.

308
00:31:37,489 --> 00:31:40,519
皆さん、ありがとうございます。
Thank you, everyone.

309
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:44,269
ここにね、何があると思います？
What do you think is here?

310
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:45,989
水。
Water.

311
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:00,919
トレンド1位って本当ですかこれ？
Is it true we're trending at number one?

312
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,349
嘘かもしれませんけれども。本当かな？
It might be a lie, but... is it true?

313
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:06,589
ガチかも。
Maybe for real.

314
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:08,519
ありがとう、みんな。
Thank you, everyone.

315
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,119
ありがとう。
Thank you.

316
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:14,549
かっこいいと言ってくれてるのを見ながら...
While seeing everyone saying it's cool...

317
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:18,319
メガホンマイクが手からすっぽ抜けかけましたよ。本当に。
the megaphone mic almost slipped out of my hand. Seriously.

318
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:20,069
焦ったわー。
I was panicking.

319
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:22,569
ということでね、えーっと。
So, anyway, um...

320
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:27,119
何かに挑んでいく曲みたいなのが好きなので、もともと。
I've always liked songs where you're challenging something.

321
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:32,489
「劣等上等」と「僕らの16bit戦争」を歌わせていただきました！
I performed 'Bring It On' and 'Our 16bit Wars'!

322
00:32:32,489 --> 00:32:37,819
ね、すごい大好きなかっこいい楽曲たちなので、ぜひぜひ原曲もチェックしてみてください！
They're such cool songs that I love, so please go check out the original versions as well!

323
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:40,119
ちょっと待って。
Wait a sec.

324
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:43,149
僕、VTuberなんで着替えは何秒かかると思う？
I'm a VTuber, so how many seconds do you think it takes me to change?

325
00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:44,269
1秒だ！
One second!

326
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:48,419
ほれ。
Look.

327
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:49,919
すごいやろ？
Amazing, right?

328
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,889
これがVTuber、バーチャルアイドルね。
This is a VTuber, a virtual idol.

329
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:56,619
では、このまま続けていくぞー！
Now then, let's keep going!

330
00:33:15,219 --> 00:33:19,519
ローリンガール / 作詞・作曲: wowaka
Rolling Girl / Lyrics & Composition: wowaka

331
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:38,319
ロンリーガールはいつまでも
The lonely girl is always

332
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:42,919
届かない夢見て
Dreaming of a dream she can't reach

333
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:48,119
騒ぐ頭の中を
The noise inside her head

334
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:52,619
かき回して かき回して
Stir it up, stir it up

335
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:07,919
「問題ない」と呟いた
"No problem," she muttered

336
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,689
言葉は失われた？
Were the words lost?

337
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:17,649
失敗 失敗 間違い探しに終われば
Failure, failure, if it ends with searching for mistakes

338
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:22,119
また回るの！
It'll spin again!

339
00:34:22,689 --> 00:34:27,219
もう一回 もう一回 私は今日も転がりますと
One more time, one more time, I'll roll again today, so

340
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:32,919
少女は言う 少女は言う 言葉に意味を奏でながら
The girl says, the girl says, as she plays the meaning of the words

341
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:37,719
もう一回 まだですよ まだまだ先は見えないので
One more time, not yet, since I still can't see what's ahead

342
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:42,649
息を止めるの 今
I'll hold my breath, now

343
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:56,919
ローリンガールの成れの果て
The end of the road for the rolling girl

344
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:00,019
届かない向こう側
The other side she can't reach

345
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:03,317
色の、重なる声と声を
...colors, the voices that layer over each other,

346
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:07,217
混ぜあわせて、混ぜあわせて。
Mix them together, mix them together.

347
00:35:07,517 --> 00:35:11,917
「問題ない。」と呟いた言葉は、失われた。
"No problem," she muttered, but the words were lost.

348
00:35:12,217 --> 00:35:17,317
どーなったっていいんだってさ、間違いだって起こしちゃおうとさ
She says it doesn't matter what happens, let's just make a mistake

349
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:21,917
誘う坂道
On this inviting slope...

350
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:27,217
もう一回、もう一回。私をどうか転がして
One more time, one more time. Please, keep me rolling

351
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:32,217
と少女は言う、少女は言う。無口に意味を重ねながら
So says the girl, so says the girl. Layering meaning into her silence

352
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:37,217
もう一回、もう少し。もうすぐ何か見えるだろうと
One more time, just a bit more. "I'll see something soon," she said

353
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:41,117
息を止めるの、今。
I'll hold my breath, right now.

354
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:46,217
もう一回、もう一回。私は今日も転がりますと
One more time, one more time. "I'll keep rolling again today," she says

355
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:51,217
と少女は言う、少女は言う。言葉に意味を奏でながら
So says the girl, so says the girl. Playing with the meaning of her words

356
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:56,217
「もう良いかい？」 「もう少し、そろそろ君も疲れたろう、ね。」
"Are you ready yet?" "Just a bit more, you're probably getting tired soon, right?"

357
00:35:56,417 --> 00:36:00,117
息を止めるよ、今。
I'll stop my breath, right now.

358
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:25,117
誰も見ていない夢を見ろ
Nobody Sees the Dream I See

359
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:25,117
作詞・作曲：ビッケブランカ / 編曲：THE CHARM PARK
Lyrics/Composition: Vicke Blanka / Arrangement: THE CHARM PARK

360
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:26,617
今度こそ生き返れない、そう思った
I thought, "This time, I won't come back to life"

361
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:31,617
ベッドの中、気付けばカーテンの隙間から
In my bed, I noticed that through the gap in the curtains

362
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:36,317
朝が正解を教えた
Morning told me the answer

363
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:41,117
ああ、生きてたと安堵
Ah, the relief of being alive

364
00:36:41,317 --> 00:36:46,117
ああ、生きてしまったと絶望
Ah, the despair of having survived

365
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:49,617
まだやれるのかな
Can I still do this?

366
00:36:49,817 --> 00:36:53,117
まだやらなきゃなのかな
Do I still have to keep going?

367
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:57,117
いっそバリアーも変えてしまえば
If only I could just change the barrier too

368
00:36:57,417 --> 00:37:02,117
なんてね
Just kidding

369
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:06,117
「僕は元気です。」そう言って今日も笑って
Saying, "I'm doing fine," and laughing again today

370
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:11,117
心はガラガラ大袈裟な音がする
My heart makes a rattling, exaggerated sound

371
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:16,117
週末の鐘の音か
Is that the sound of the weekend bell?

372
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:24,117
それでもこの声が、それでもこの口が
Even so, this voice... even so, this mouth...

373
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:29,117
それでもこの喉が
Even so, this throat...

374
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:34,117
千切れるくらい叫ぶよ
Will scream until it tears

375
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:38,117
この腕が、真っ白なこの羽が
These arms... these pure white wings...

376
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:43,117
僕のこの命が
This life of mine...

377
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:47,117
生きたいと歌ってる
Is singing, "I want to live!"

378
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:51,617
できるなら愛されたい、許されたい
If I can, I want to be loved, I want to be forgiven

379
00:37:51,817 --> 00:37:54,117
ここにいたい、愛したい
I want to be here, I want to love

380
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:57,617
誰も見ていない夢を見るよ
I'll see the dream that nobody else sees

381
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:02,117
だから僕を見ていろよ
So keep your eyes on me!

382
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:12,617
感情の捨て方は、粗大ゴミのシールを貼る
The way to throw away emotions is to stick a "bulky waste" sticker on them

383
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:17,617
本音はいつも強がりの裏
My true feelings are always behind my bravado

384
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:22,117
潰れる音がするんだ
I can hear the sound of them being crushed

385
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:26,617
ああ、気付かれなかった
Ah, nobody noticed

386
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:31,117
ああ、気付いてほしいんだ
Ah, I want you to notice

387
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:36,117
それでも君が笑ってくれるなら
Even so, if you will smile for me

388
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:40,117
いっそ心を失くしてしまえば
If only I could just lose my heart entirely

389
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:45,117
なんてね
Just kidding

390
00:38:55,417 --> 00:39:00,117
「叶わない」なんて、一瞬でも思ったら負けだ
"It won't come true" — if I think that for even a second, I've lost

391
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:05,117
「叶わない」なんて、一瞬でもよぎれば辞めだ
"It won't come true" — if that even crosses my mind, I'll quit

392
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:10,117
何万通の諦める理由があったとしても
Even if there were tens of thousands of reasons to give up

393
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:17,117
たった一つの、勇気がこの手の中に
I have just one piece of courage in my hands

394
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:22,117
それでもこの声が、それでもこの口が
Even so, this voice... even so, this mouth...

395
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:27,617
それでもこの喉が
Even so, this throat...

396
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:32,617
千切れるくらい叫ぶよ
Will scream until it tears

397
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:37,617
この腕が、真っ白なこの羽が
These arms... these pure white wings...

398
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:42,617
僕のこの命が
This life of mine...

399
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:47,117
生きたいと歌ってる
Is singing, "I want to live!"

400
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:51,617
できるなら愛されたい、許されたい
If I can, I want to be loved, I want to be forgiven

401
00:39:51,817 --> 00:39:54,117
ここにいたい、愛したい
I want to be here, I want to love

402
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:57,117
誰も見ていない夢を見るよ
I'll see the dream that nobody else sees

403
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:59,117
だから僕を...
So, look at me...

404
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:03,992
誰も見ていない夢を見せるよ
I'll show you a dream that no one has seen.

405
00:40:04,192 --> 00:40:06,592
だから僕を信じて
So, believe in me.

406
00:40:39,892 --> 00:40:43,992
はい！皆さん！今のは最後のオリジナル楽曲で
Hi, everyone! That was my final original song...

407
00:40:43,992 --> 00:40:49,192
「誰も見ていない夢を見ろ」というね...
...titled "Daremo Miteinai Yume wo Miro" (See the Dream No One Has Seen).

408
00:40:49,692 --> 00:40:53,092
本日24時にリリース！わー！
It's being released today at midnight! Yay!

409
00:40:53,092 --> 00:40:59,392
こちらのジャケットをですね、頼りに探してくださいね、各所。
Look for this cover art to find it on various platforms.

410
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:04,292
いや、この曲あまりにも卒業ソングすぎるって思ったでしょ？
You probably thought this song sounds way too much like a graduation song, right?

411
00:41:04,292 --> 00:41:09,192
これ実は卒業決める前に作られていた曲で、卒業決める前に。
Actually, it was written before my graduation was decided. Before it was decided.

412
00:41:09,692 --> 00:41:13,892
MVは明日ね、明日の20時、もうかなたそがいなくなっても
The MV will be released tomorrow at 8:00 PM. Even after Kanata-so is gone...

413
00:41:13,892 --> 00:41:18,192
予約投稿というものがある、ネットには。
...there's this thing called scheduled uploads on the internet.

414
00:41:18,192 --> 00:41:23,192
ということで明日の20時に投稿されるんですが、内容も実は卒業誰も知らずに作っているということで、
So it'll be posted tomorrow at 8:00 PM. The content was also made without anyone knowing about the graduation...

415
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:27,292
なんかこんな偶然の一致でそれっぽくなってしまいました。
...so it's quite a coincidence that it turned out like this.

416
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:31,292
それを踏まえてまた「なんでやねん」と思いながら聞いてください。
Knowing that, please listen to it again while thinking "Wait, what?"

417
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:35,392
ヒゲドライバーさんにね、作詞作曲していただいて、
It was written and composed by Hige Driver-san.

418
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:39,092
あの悪魔の子いっぱい歌ったりしたんで、超嬉しかったです。ありがとうございます。
He's the one who did "Akuma no Ko" which I've sung a lot, so I was super happy. Thank you!

419
00:41:40,092 --> 00:41:43,292
そしてですね、お次はグッズを紹介させていただきます！
And now, I'd like to introduce the merchandise!

420
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:47,392
こちら！はい！天音かなた卒業グッズがもう出てます！
Here they are! Yes! Amane Kanata graduation goods are already available!

421

可愛いでしょ？じゃん！
Isn't it cute? Ta-da!

424
00:42:00,192 --> 00:42:04,292
こちらね、おしおママに思いを伝えた上で、描き下ろしていただいたイラストになっております。
This is an illustration newly drawn by Oshio-mama after I shared my thoughts with her.

425
00:42:04,292 --> 00:42:08,892
本当にね、みんなに対して最後はまあ笑顔かなとか、
I thought that for the end, I should be smiling for everyone...

426
00:42:08,892 --> 00:42:13,292
青い薔薇というものを最初からちょっとモチーフ的に入れたりすることがあったので、
...and since I've used blue roses as a motif from the start...

427
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:16,892
こちらでもまた入れていただきました。
...I had her include them here as well.

428
00:42:16,892 --> 00:42:20,392
可愛いでしょ？笑顔にしてもらいました。
Isn't it cute? I asked her to make me smile.

429

This is amazing—a Kanata & Konata acrylic stand.

431
00:42:28,992 --> 00:42:32,892
これもね、僕がね、本当にね、こなたという妹というものを
I really wanted to leave my sister, Konata, behind in this world...

432
00:42:32,892 --> 00:42:37,392
ぜひこの世に残して生きてよ、ということで
...to live on, so...

433
00:42:37,392 --> 00:42:41,892
僕が欲しいがために生まれたグッズでございます。
...this is a piece of merch born from my own desire for it.

434
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:45,392
可愛いでしょ？エロイよな。
Isn't it cute? It's kind of sexy, right?

435
00:42:46,392 --> 00:42:49,492
ということで、次は、こちら！じゃん！
And next is this! Ta-da!

436
00:42:49,492 --> 00:42:53,492

It's a voice keychain! For the voices,

437
00:42:53,492 --> 00:42:58,492
6種は僕がオリジナル考えました。オリジナルっちゅうても、「へい、こんかなたー」とかだけのさ、じゃん！
I came up with the six original lines myself. Even if they're just things like "Hey, kon-kanata!" Ta-da!

438
00:42:58,992 --> 00:43:03,492
で、このイラストもですね、僕原案を書いて、プロがすごいよくしてくれましたね。
I also drew the rough draft for this illustration, and the pros made it look great.

439
00:43:03,992 --> 00:43:08,492
でもわかるでしょ、かなたその絵柄って。いや、ありがとうございますと。
But you can still see Kanata-so's art style in it, right? Thank you so much.

440
00:43:08,992 --> 00:43:13,492
収録ボイスは届いてからのお楽しみです。いっぱいポチポチしてください。

This is a certificate for the ultimate Hey-min who supported me until the end.

444
00:43:24,992 --> 00:43:29,492
シリアルナンバーが入っていて世界で一枚です。
It has a serial number, so it's the only one of its kind in the world.

445
00:43:29,992 --> 00:43:34,492
ちなみにちょっと、あのお買い得…じゃねえや、手が届きやすいので、
By the way, it's quite... not "a bargain", but affordable...

446
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:38,492
これだけでもぜひ皆さん、思い出によろしくお願いします。
...so I hope you'll consider getting just this one as a memento.

447
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:43,492
今までへい民じゃなかったけど、かなたーんって思った人も、あるてぃめっとへい民だからあんたは。
Even if you weren't a Hey-min before, if you feel for Kanata now, you're an Ultimate Hey-min too.

448
00:43:43,992 --> 00:43:47,492

ええ！ありがとう！
Eh! Thank you!

470
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:05,860
え、ちょっと我々から渡したいものがありますよね？
Eh, we have something we'd like to give you, right?

471
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,590
何何何？マジで聞いてない、知らない、何？
What, what, what? I seriously didn't hear about this. I don't know, what?

472
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,820
マジで言ってない、マジで言ってない。
We seriously didn't tell you, seriously didn't tell you.

473
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:11,990
え、なんか、やだ、ちょっと。
Eh, wait, I don't like this (emotionally).

474
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,690
え、泣かせないで、ねえ、待って。
Eh, don't make me cry, hey, wait.

475
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,790
はい、どうぞー！
Here you go!

476
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,290
ありがとう。持てないか、持てないよね。
Thank you. I can't hold it, can I? It's too much.

477
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,960
あ、すごい！
Ah, amazing!

478
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,490
これ、三人で選んだ。
We three chose this together.

479
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:26,490
花束です。
It's a bouquet.

480
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,590
え、すごい、なんか、とても美しいバラみたいな感じの...
Eh, wow, it's like a really beautiful bunch of roses...

481
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,560
本当はね、バーチャル空間には映らないんだけど。
Actually, it doesn't show up in virtual space.

482
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:34,790
ちょっと映らないんですけど。
It's not really showing up.

483
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,790
僕だけのものです、みんな。
This is just for me, everyone.

484
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:40,590
え、すごい、こんなにデカい花束、もらったことない。
Eh, wow, I've never received such a huge bouquet.

485
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:42,490
じゃ、一旦回収します。
Well, we'll take it back for a moment.

486
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,390
あ、すいません、ありがとう。
Ah, sorry, thank you.

487
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,790
それとね、三人で寄せ書きもしまして。
And also, the three of us wrote a message board together.

488
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,390
ええー！すごーい！ありがとう！うれしい！
Eeeh! Amazing! Thank you! I'm so happy!

489
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:52,490
いや、こんなん、今見たら泣いちゃう。
Man, if I look at this now, I'll cry.

490
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:55,890
泣いちゃう、泣いちゃう。後でじっくりね。
You'll cry, you'll cry. Read it carefully later.

491
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,990
本当にありがとう。
Truly, thank you.

492
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:01,390
みんな、マジで、待って、本当にやだ。
Everyone, seriously, wait, I really don't like this.

493
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,590
本当にやだ、泣かせないで。
I really don't like it, don't make me cry.

494
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:06,290
やめる？やめるのやめる？
Stopping? Are you stopping stopping?

495
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:08,990
ここで、ここで、ここで、大円団にするんですけど。
Right here, right here, right here, it's going to be a grand finale.

496
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:12,490
じゃ、三人もしょってくれるってことで一緒に。
So, the three of you will also support me, together.

497
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,490
背負うよ、背負うよ。心強。
We'll carry it, we'll carry it. Reassuring.

498
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,590
明日初配信、明日初配信。
First stream tomorrow, first stream tomorrow.

499
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,990
そうだね、明日ね。切り替えて初配信しよう。
That's right, tomorrow. Let's switch gears and have the first stream.

500
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,590
切り替えていくか。いや、もう、ありがとう、みんな。
Guess I'll switch gears. Man, thank you everyone.

501
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,790
うるせえ...
You're so noisy...

502
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:29,990
めちゃめちゃ頼んだの、会いに来たいって。
I really begged them, saying I wanted them to come see me.

503
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,390
そうなの。もう、一人でなんか勝手にいろんなものさ、しょってさ。
That's right. You were just carrying so many things on your own.

504
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,990
そうだよ。やめていくなんて許せない。
Exactly. I can't forgive you for just leaving like that.

505
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,890
ありがとう。逃がさない。頼れよ、もっと。
Thank you. We won't let you get away. Rely on us more.

506
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,990
周りを頼れ！頼れ！頼れ！
Rely on those around you! Rely! Rely!

507
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:47,990
ありがとう。ありがとう。無理を言って今日駆けつけさせていただきました。
Thank you. Thank you. We asked for a lot and rushed here today.

508
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:50,590
本当に、本当に、本当に、すごいこと。
Really, really, really, it's an amazing thing.

509
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,490
ありがとうね。最後まで見るから。
Thank you. We'll watch until the end.

510
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:56,390
見てるからね！見ているからね！行っちゃうの？
We're watching! We're watching! You're going?

511
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,990
行かない、おめーだよ行くんは！
I'm not going, you're the ones leaving!

512
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:02,990
おめーが行くんだよ！おめーが行くんだよ！先に引くんじゃねーよ！
You're the ones leaving! You're the ones leaving! Don't pull back first!

513
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,590
ありがとう。行かない、見てるからね。

ずっと見てるよ。頑張ってね、最後まで。
We'll watch forever. Do your best until the end.

515
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:11,990
まだ泣かないよ、まだあるからね。
I won't cry yet, there's still more to come.

516
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:15,490
戻ってきてんのね、今、本当にずっと。頼むよ、頑張れ。
You're coming back to yourself now, truly. We're counting on you, good luck.

517
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,590
ありがとうね。これからもずっと仲良くしてください。
Thank you. Please keep being friends with me forever.

518
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:21,990
当たり前だよ、一生友達だよ。
Of course, we're friends for life.

519
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:25,990
一生友達だよ！一生友達！これからもずっとだからね。
Friends for life! Friends for life! It'll be like this forever, okay?

520
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:30,990
当たり前だよ。縁側で語り明かそうね、おばあちゃんになっても。
Of course. Let's talk all night on the veranda, even when we're old grandmas.

521
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:33,990
そこで見てるから. ありがとう、頑張れ！
We'll be watching from there. Thank you, good luck!

Thank you. See you, see you, see you...

524
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:58,990
ゲストは呼べないけどダメだよーって言ってたんですけど、ころさんと、あずちゃんと、らみちゃんが来てくれました。
I said I couldn't invite guests and that it was a no-go, but Koro-san, AZKi-chan, and Lamy-chan came.

525
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:07,990
本当に、ありがとうございます。あの、それでは、ここから、オリジナル楽曲が続いていきます。
Truly, thank you very much. Now, from here, original songs will continue.

526
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:15,990
歌えるのはね、最後になってしまうんですが、だからこそ、心を込めて歌っていこうと思います。
This will be the last time I can sing them, so I'll sing with all my heart.

527
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:26,990
ちょっと、マジでびっくりした。本当にありがとう。もう本当に素晴らしい友達を持って幸せです。
Wait, I was seriously surprised. Truly, thank you. I'm so happy to have such wonderful friends.

528
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:34,990

きゅーぴっど。
Cupid

530
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:06,290
キミのキューピッドです　夢中、注、注
I'm your Cupid. Crazy about you, attention, attention

531
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:10,290
きっと夢に出てくる　注、注、注
I'll surely appear in your dreams. Attention, attention, attention

532
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:15,290
ぎゅっと抱きしめて
Hug me tight

533
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:16,990
インキャララバイ
Inkyara Lullaby

534
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,990
昨日待った着信音　ヤダヤダヤダヤダ
The ringtone I waited for yesterday. No no no no

535
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:21,990
強制終了トワイライト　ヤダヤダヤダヤダ
Forced termination twilight. No no no no

536
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:24,990
誰か止めてエレベーター　ヤダヤダヤダヤダ
Someone stop the elevator. No no no no

537
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:27,590
そう我らこそ陰の者
Yes, we are the ones in the shadows

538
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,490
笑おう笑おう　せめて笑おう
Let's laugh, let's laugh, at least let's laugh

539
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,390
アハハ　ウフフ　笑い飛ばせ
Ahaha Ufufu, laugh it off

540
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,290
来ない来ない　乾きまくり
Not coming, not coming, bone dry

541
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:39,290
反省反省　また反省だ
Reflection, reflection, reflecting again

542
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:42,290
鏡ですら目を逸らした
Even the mirror looked away

543
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:45,290
明日は今日より人間になりたい
Tomorrow I want to be more human than today

544
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:48,990
なりたい　なりたい　なりたい！
I want to be, I want to be, I want to be!

545
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,190
おやすみなさーい！
Good night!

546
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:54,290
DA・LI・LA

547
00:50:00,115 --> 00:50:01,515
...と言っても当たり前じゃないのに
...Even so, it's not something to take for granted

548
00:50:01,515 --> 00:50:02,915
You are クラッチでゾンビな可愛い子
You are a cute zombie child in the clutch

549
00:50:02,915 --> 00:50:03,615

In short, if you've schemed, you're clear for takeoff.

706
01:00:54,638 --> 01:00:57,138
ワクワク寸前さ！
On the verge of excitement!

707
01:01:04,338 --> 01:01:06,938
聞いて、みんなと離れるのが寂しいのと
Listen, I'm sad to be leaving everyone and...

708
01:01:07,138 --> 01:01:09,438
ガッキーの結婚が立ち直れてません
I haven't recovered from Gakky's marriage yet.

709
01:01:09,638 --> 01:01:13,438
僕をアイドルにしてくれてみんな本当にありがとう！
Thank you everyone for making me an idol!

710
01:01:13,638 --> 01:01:17,438
なんだよ、そんなこと言っちゃダメだ、おバカ！
What, you can't say things like that, you dummy!

711
01:01:17,638 --> 01:01:19,938
わあ、すごい、ありがとう！
Wow, amazing, thank you!

712
01:01:20,138 --> 01:01:22,438
響き合そうでんでんごまアウェイ
Resonating, spin like a top, away.

713
01:01:22,638 --> 01:01:24,438
虎視眈々でいたいだもん
I want to be watchful for an opportunity.

714
01:01:24,638 --> 01:01:26,438
だって意気昂々だもん
Because I'm in high spirits.

715
01:01:26,638 --> 01:01:29,938
全方位がっつり当てが張っていらっしゃい
Come with full force from all directions.

716
01:01:30,638 --> 01:01:33,938
いつでも心はちゃんと10代で
My heart is always in its teens.

717
01:01:34,138 --> 01:01:38,938
いたいんだ好奇心絶えず熱心で
I want to stay that way, with constant curiosity and enthusiasm.

718
01:01:39,138 --> 01:01:43,438
いたいんだって言い聞かせるんだ
I tell myself I want to stay that way.

719
01:01:43,638 --> 01:01:48,438
調子に乗ったらすぐ飽きられちゃうから
Because if I get carried away, people will get tired of me soon.

720
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:52,638
あー買い取んなら横暴どんと来い！ですって
Ah, if you're buying, come at me with your tyranny!

721
01:01:53,138 --> 01:01:56,938
すなわち特者生存ワンダラダーで
Namely, with Tokusha Seizon Wonder-la-der.

722
01:01:57,138 --> 01:02:02,938
しがみつけ努力とは最後まで諦めないこと
Cling to it, effort means not giving up until the end.

723
01:02:03,138 --> 01:02:05,438
見守っておいて
Please keep an eye on me.

724
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:09,638
本当はBaby　自信がないよ
To be honest Baby, I have no confidence.

725
01:02:10,138 --> 01:02:13,938
本当はBaby　不安ばかりで泣きそうだぜ
To be honest Baby, I'm so anxious I could cry.

726
01:02:14,138 --> 01:02:18,438
おねがいBaby　くじけないって決めたの
Please Baby, I've decided not to give up.

727
01:02:18,638 --> 01:02:22,438
だからBaby　挑戦したいよ未開の天地
So Baby, I want to challenge uncharted territory.

728
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:25,138
無限のフィールで！
In an infinite field!

729
01:02:36,638 --> 01:02:39,938
全身全霊ちゃんと歓迎して
Welcome with all your heart and soul.

730
01:02:40,138 --> 01:02:43,938
高まるかい？いっそちゃんと共感して
Is the excitement rising? Just empathize properly.

731
01:02:44,138 --> 01:02:48,438
興奮し合おう　僕が呼んだもん
Let's get excited together, because I called for it.

732
01:02:48,638 --> 01:02:53,938
翻弄するんだもん　現実越えろ未来
I'll toy with you, surpass reality, future!

733
01:02:54,138 --> 01:02:57,938
Ah 逆転も平気！スイッチ入れちゃった
Ah, reversal is fine! I've flipped the switch.

734
01:02:58,138 --> 01:03:02,438
すなわち特者生存ワンダラダーで
Namely, with Tokusha Seizon Wonder-la-der.

735
01:03:02,638 --> 01:03:08,638
でもしもおもしろがれること探し放題で
And if, you can find as many fun things as you want.

736
01:03:09,138 --> 01:03:12,438
無限のフィールだね
It's an infinite field, isn't it?

737
01:03:12,638 --> 01:03:14,438
ハプニングしなくてもいい
It's okay if nothing happens.

738
01:03:14,638 --> 01:03:16,938
ど真ん中一直線
Straight through the center.

739
01:03:17,138 --> 01:03:19,938
つまりこれが僕の答えなんだ
In short, this is my answer.

740
01:03:20,138 --> 01:03:23,438
胸を張り今を生きるその意味を
With pride, the meaning of living in the now.

741
01:03:23,638 --> 01:03:27,638
明くる日もくるくる日も確かめ進め！
Day after day, day after day, confirm it and move forward!

742
01:03:38,638 --> 01:03:39,938
ありがとうございました！
Thank you very much!

743
01:03:50,138 --> 01:03:54,638
みんなー、ありがとうございましたー！
Everyone, thank you very much!

744
01:03:57,638 --> 01:04:03,438
えー、聴いていただいたのは、オリ曲メドレー、メドレーにしました。
Well, what you just heard was an original song medley. I made it into a medley.

745
01:04:03,638 --> 01:04:05,438
繋ぎましたよ。
I connected them.

746
01:04:05,638 --> 01:04:09,438
そして「世界で一番のアイドル」、作詞をしました。
And "The Best Idol in the World", I wrote the lyrics.

747
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:12,438
この時は卒業だって考えてなかったから、
At that time I wasn't even thinking about graduating,

748
01:04:12,638 --> 01:04:15,438
本当に、あの、いっぱい聴いてほしい曲で、
so it's a song I really want you to listen to a lot.

749
01:04:15,638 --> 01:04:18,438
そして「特者生存ワンダラダー！！」でした！
And that was "Tokusha Seizon Wonder-la-der!!"

750
01:04:18,638 --> 01:04:23,438
はい、これを初めてね、出したね。え、オリジナル楽曲ですけれども。
Yes, I released this for the first time. Well, it's an original song.

751
01:04:23,638 --> 01:04:26,438
ちょっと語りたいこといっぱいあるんですけど、
There's a lot I want to talk about,

752
01:04:26,638 --> 01:04:28,438
やっぱりあの服だよね。
but it's got to be that outfit, right?

753
01:04:28,638 --> 01:04:33,638
ってことで、1秒着替えてきました！
So, I've done a one-second costume change!

754
01:04:34,138 --> 01:04:36,438
はい、やっぱりこれだよね、みんな。
Yes, it has to be this, everyone.

755
01:04:36,638 --> 01:04:38,438
ヘイ、こんかなた！
Hey, Kon-kanata!

756
01:04:38,638 --> 01:04:42,438
キャッチコピーは握力50キロ、ギュッギュに握りつぶしちゃうぞ。
My catchphrase is: with a grip strength of 50kg, I'll crush you tight.

757
01:04:42,638 --> 01:04:46,438
ホロライブ4期生、かなたんこと天音かなたです！
Hololive 4th generation, known as Kanatan, I'm Amane Kanata!

758
01:04:46,638 --> 01:04:52,438
はい、ということでね、録画...危ないことは、危ない橋は渡らないでおきまして、
Right, so... recordings... let's not take any risks,

759
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:56,438
今のような、あの、感じでいきたいと思うんですけれども、
I'd like to continue with this kind of vibe,

760
01:04:56,638 --> 01:05:00,138
もう本当にオリジナル楽曲は、フェスやイベント、ソロライブなど...
but really, original songs at festivals, events, solo lives...

761
01:05:00,186 --> 01:05:03,686
他にもたくさんの思い出が詰まっていて、
There are so many other memories packed in here.

762
01:05:03,686 --> 01:05:07,686
みんながね、たくさん聴いてくれたおかげと言いますか、本当にありがとうございました...と思っています。
I suppose it's thanks to everyone listening so much... thank you so very much, that's what I feel.

763
01:05:08,686 --> 01:05:15,186
えー、みんなね、あの、この後ですね、22時10分から、最後の歌ってみた。
Um, everyone, after this, at 22:10, I'll be posting my last cover song.

764
01:05:15,686 --> 01:05:20,186
みんなと約束してました。あの、動画消えちゃって歌い直そうって言っていたね、
I promised you all. Since the video was deleted and I said I'd sing it again,

765
01:05:20,186 --> 01:05:27,186
あの、KINGを投稿するので、絶対見てくださいね！
I'll be posting 'KING,' so please be sure to watch it!

766
01:05:29,186 --> 01:05:33,186
毎日一緒にいてくれたへい民、ホロライブの大好きなメンバーたち、
To the Heimin who stayed with me every day, my beloved members of hololive,

767
01:05:33,186 --> 01:05:38,686
そしてたくさん支えてくださった本当にお世話になった方々、全ての方に感謝しています。
and all the people who supported and took care of me, I'm grateful to everyone.

768
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:44,686
夢のような時間は本当にありがとうございました。心、口...ここで噛むのね。
Thank you so much for this dream-like time. My heart, my mou... I'm tripping over my words here.

769
01:05:45,186 --> 01:05:50,186
子供の頃のアイドルになりたいという夢が、作詞作曲をしてみたいという夢を叶えました。
My childhood dream of becoming an idol and my dream of songwriting and composing have come true.

770
01:05:50,686 --> 01:05:56,686
そして、最後の曲ですが、まだ歌うんですよ。僕が初めて作詞作曲した楽曲があります。
And for the last song, I'm still singing. There's a piece I wrote and composed for the first time.

771
01:05:58,686 --> 01:06:03,186
今はいない同期、ココの卒業に合わせて、
For the graduation of our genmate who's no longer here, Coco,

772
01:06:03,186 --> 01:06:07,686
4期生のトワ、ルーナ、わために捧げた楽曲です。
this is a song I dedicated to Towa, Luna, and Watame of the 4th gen.

773
01:06:08,186 --> 01:06:12,686
前を向いて、笑顔で、この楽曲で活動を最後にしたいと思います。
I want to end my activities with this song, looking forward and with a smile.

774
01:06:13,186 --> 01:06:16,686
それでは聴いてください、キセキ結び。
Please listen, Kiseki Musubi.

775
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:25,186
キセキ結び / 作詞・作曲 天音かなた 編曲 ハム
Kiseki Musubi / Lyrics & Composition: Amane Kanata, Arrangement: Ham

776
01:06:26,686 --> 01:06:30,186
約束しようよ 僕らが出会えたキセキ
Let's make a promise, the miracle that brought us together

777
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:36,686
忘れないように
So we never forget

778
01:06:46,686 --> 01:06:51,686
夢抱いて集う 青春アニメみたいな
Gathering with dreams, like a youth anime

779
01:06:52,186 --> 01:06:56,686
ハッピーなエンドになる彼方へ飛ぶよ
Flying towards a future where there's a happy ending

780
01:06:57,186 --> 01:07:01,686
寝ぼけ眼 あくびして 今日は何をしようか
Sleepy-eyed and yawning, what should we do today?

781
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:06,686
永遠に続く海を駆けるケルン
A cairn crossing the sea that goes on forever

782
01:07:07,186 --> 01:07:11,686
今は溜息よりも勇気を
For now, give me courage over sighs

783
01:07:12,186 --> 01:07:16,686
諦めるなんてないの ここで歌う
There's no giving up, I'll sing right here

784
01:07:17,686 --> 01:07:20,686
僕の声は聞こえてますか？
Can you hear my voice?

785
01:07:21,186 --> 01:07:24,686
君に届け
Reaching out to you

786
01:07:25,186 --> 01:07:29,686
学校の友達じゃ きっと出会えなかった
We surely wouldn't have met as school friends

787
01:07:30,186 --> 01:07:34,686
画面の先の遥か遠くまで
To the vast distance beyond the screen

788
01:07:35,186 --> 01:07:39,186
ささくれた言葉も 誰かの笑顔になる
Even frayed words can become someone's smile

789
01:07:39,686 --> 01:07:44,186
それぞれの色で 星結ぶキセキ
Connecting stars with each of our colors, a miracle

790
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:51,186
キラキラ輝くステージに 連れて行くよ
I'll take you to the sparkling stage

791
01:08:00,186 --> 01:08:04,686
泣いて笑ってはしゃいで 毎日ジェットコースター
Crying, laughing, having fun, every day is a roller coaster

792
01:08:05,186 --> 01:08:09,686
たまには寝転んで お昼寝しよう
Sometimes let's just lie down and take a nap

793
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:14,686
ちょっと自信ない時 お隣で応援して
When I lack a bit of confidence, cheer me on from by my side

794
01:08:15,186 --> 01:08:19,686
今日だけは泣いちゃうこと 許してね
Just for today, please forgive me for crying

795
01:08:20,186 --> 01:08:24,686
未来の僕がアルバム開く
My future self opens the album

796
01:08:25,186 --> 01:08:30,186
傷ついた写真だって 宝物だ
Even the hurt photos are treasures

797
01:08:31,186 --> 01:08:35,686
僕の愛が見えていますか？
Can you see my love?

798
01:08:36,186 --> 01:08:38,686
君に届け
Reaching out to you

799
01:08:39,186 --> 01:08:43,186
顔も個性も 性格も違うけれど
Our faces, personalities, and characters are different, but...

800
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:48,186
弱気な時は目蓋 ギュッと瞑り
When feeling weak, I close my eyes tight

801
01:08:48,686 --> 01:08:52,686
もう1回、もう1回、絶対に諦めない
One more time, one more time, I'll never give up

802
01:08:53,186 --> 01:08:57,686
前の背中追う 下手っぴな僕でも
Even if I'm clumsy and just following the back in front of me...

803
01:08:58,186 --> 01:09:03,686
君の隣にいたくて 走るの
I run because I want to be by your side

804
01:09:04,186 --> 01:09:12,686
誰にも言えずに 描いた夢がたとえ叶わないとしても
Even if the dream I drew without telling anyone doesn't come true...

805
01:09:13,186 --> 01:09:17,686
ボロボロの靴でも カッコよくなくても
Even with worn-out shoes, even if I'm not cool...

806
01:09:18,186 --> 01:09:25,686
あぁ、幼いあの日の僕ならなんて言う？ 「止まらないで」
Ah, what would the young me from that day say? "Don't stop"

807
01:09:26,686 --> 01:09:35,686
初めて僕ら出会った日 まるで昨日みたいに思い出すけど
I remember the day we first met as if it were yesterday, but...

808
01:09:36,186 --> 01:09:41,186
もう行こうか 最後になぜ重なる
Let's go now, why do they overlap at the end...

809
01:09:41,686 --> 01:09:47,686
キセキ
The miracles...

810
01:09:48,686 --> 01:09:52,186
僕の声は聞こえてますか？
Can you hear my voice?

811
01:09:52,686 --> 01:09:57,186
君に届け
Reaching out to you

812
01:09:57,686 --> 01:10:00,186
黒板のメッセージ 桜の中をくぐって
The message on the blackboard, passing through the cherry blossoms...

813
01:10:00,161 --> 01:10:01,161
...声を聴いて
...hear your voice

814
01:10:01,461 --> 01:10:03,661
ずっと ずっと
Forever and ever

815
01:10:04,261 --> 01:10:06,261
嬉しい日 楽しい日
Happy days, fun days

816
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:08,661
悲しい日 別れの日も
Sad days, even days of parting

817
01:10:09,261 --> 01:10:11,461
それぞれの色で
With their own colors

818
01:10:11,661 --> 01:10:13,961
星結ぶ奇跡
A star-connecting miracle

819
01:10:14,461 --> 01:10:17,461
キラキラ輝くステージで
On this sparkling stage

820
01:10:17,961 --> 01:10:20,961
約束しよう
Let's make a promise

821
01:10:21,961 --> 01:10:24,961
いつか ここで
That someday, here

822
01:10:25,961 --> 01:10:29,361
また会おう
We'll meet again

823
01:10:30,361 --> 01:10:32,461
みんな... ありがとう
Everyone... thank you.

824
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:36,661
ホロライブ所属、アイドルの天音かなたでした。
I was your idol, Amane Kanata, from Hololive.

825
01:10:37,161 --> 01:10:40,561
6年間 本当に幸せな日々でした。
These six years have been truly happy days.

826
01:10:40,961 --> 01:10:44,761
へい民、不器用な僕を応援してくれてありがとう。
Heimin, thank you for supporting someone as clumsy as me.

827
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:46,961
ずっとずっと大好きだよ。
I'll always, always love you.

828
01:10:47,261 --> 01:10:49,161
ずっとずっと家族だよ。
We'll always, always be family.

829
01:10:49,461 --> 01:10:53,361
みんな本当にありがとうございました！
Thank you everyone, truly, for everything!

830
01:10:58,661 --> 01:11:00,661
ありがとう
Thank you.
