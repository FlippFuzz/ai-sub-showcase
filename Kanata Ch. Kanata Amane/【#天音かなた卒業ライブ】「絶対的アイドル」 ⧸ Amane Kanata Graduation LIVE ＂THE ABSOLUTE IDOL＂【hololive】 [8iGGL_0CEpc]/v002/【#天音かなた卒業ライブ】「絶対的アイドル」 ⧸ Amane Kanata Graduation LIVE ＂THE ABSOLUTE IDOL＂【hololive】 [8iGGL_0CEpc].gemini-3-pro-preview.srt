何を見ているの
What are you looking at?

どこまでも澄んだ瞳で
With those endlessly clear eyes.

11
00:05:58,248 --> 00:06:03,048
二人だけが触れる
Where only the two of us can touch,

12

世界できっと
surely in this world,

13

全てが今始まるから
everything is starting now.

14
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:20,048

That just to meet you,

15
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:28,048
生まれたこと伝えたいんだ
I was born—I want to tell you that.

16
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:35,548
粗野な風も 胸刺す視線も
The rough wind, and the gazes that pierce my chest,

17
00:06:35,548 --> 00:06:40,048
全部
everything...

18
00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:46,048
ヒリヒリする声になるのさ
...becomes a stinging voice.

19
00:06:46,048 --> 00:06:52,048

Forever by your side.

20
00:06:53,048 --> 00:06:59,048

has nothing to look back on.

22
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:09,548

...self, overflowing with tears, but...

00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:51,048
走り出せる
I can start running.

28
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:57,048
もしもはぐれたら
If we get separated,

29
00:07:58,048 --> 00:08:04,048
体ごと散ってみせる
I'll scatter my whole body to show you.

30
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:11,548
花びらたった一枚の
Just a single flower petal,

31
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:17,048
姿になって
becoming that form,

32
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:22,048

飛べたんだ
we could fly.

38
00:08:58,048 --> 00:09:03,048
出会えた奇跡に
For the miracle of meeting you,

39
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:10,048
もう息が止まりそうだよ
it feels like my breath is stopping.

40
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:17,048
つないだその手に
In that connected hand,

41
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:24,048
少し強くなれる気がする
I feel I can become a little stronger.

42
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:31,048
出会えた奇跡に
For the miracle of meeting you,

43
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:39,048

it feels like my breath is stopping.

44

明日も 未来も
Tomorrow, and the future too,

45
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:55,048
ただどうしようもなく 好きだよ
I just helplessly love you.

46
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:10,523
Oh-oh-oh...

47
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:25,823
いつか僕らの上をスレスレに通り過ぎていったあの飛行機を
That airplane that passed right over us that day,

48
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:28,523
不思議なくらいに覚えてる
I remember it strangely well,

49
00:10:28,523 --> 00:10:30,823
意味もないのに なぜか
Even though there's no meaning to it, somehow.

50
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:33,423
不甲斐なくて泣いた日の夜に
On the night I cried from feeling worthless,

51
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:36,023
ただ強くなりたいと願ってた
I just wished to become stronger.

52
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:39,823
そのために必要な勇気を探し求めていた
I was searching for the courage I needed for that.

53
00:10:39,823 --> 00:10:44,723
残酷な運命が定まってるとして
Even if a cruel fate is destined,

54
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:49,623
それがいつの日か僕の前に現れるとして
Even if it appears before me someday,

55
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:51,223
ただ一瞬
Just for a moment,

56
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:54,623
この一瞬 息ができるなら
If I can breathe for just this moment,

57
00:10:54,623 --> 00:10:59,623
どうでもいいと思えた その心を
I felt like nothing else mattered. That heart...

58
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:03,223
もう一度 遠くへ行け
Go far away once more!

59
00:11:03,223 --> 00:11:04,523
遠くへ行けと
Go far away!

60
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:07,123
僕の中で誰かが歌う
Someone is singing inside me.

61
00:11:07,123 --> 00:11:10,823
どうしようもないほど熱烈に
So passionately that I can't help it.

62
00:11:10,823 --> 00:11:13,123
いつだって目を腫らした
My eyes were always swollen,

63
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:15,623
君が二度と悲しまないように
So that you would never be sad again,

64
00:11:15,623 --> 00:11:19,423
笑えるそんなヒーローになるための歌
A song to become a hero who can laugh.

65
00:11:20,823 --> 00:11:23,223
さらば掲げろピースサイン
Farewell, raise your peace sign!

66
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:25,823
転がっていくストーリーを
Let this rolling story go on.

67
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:37,423
守りたいだなんて言えるほど
I'm not strong enough to say I want to protect you,

68
00:11:37,423 --> 00:11:39,923
君が弱くはないの分かってた
I knew you weren't that weak.

69
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:42,323
それ以上に僕は弱くてさ
I was even weaker than that,

70
00:11:42,323 --> 00:11:44,723
君が大事だったんだ
You were just so precious to me.

71
00:11:44,723 --> 00:11:47,323
独りで生きてくんだなんてさ
"I'm going to live on my own."

72
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:49,823
口をついて叫んだあの日から
Since that day I blurted that out,

73
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:52,223
変わっていく僕を笑えない
I can't laugh at myself changing,

74
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:54,623
独りが怖い僕を
At myself who is scared of being alone.

75
00:11:54,623 --> 00:11:57,123
蹴飛ばして噛み付いて
Kicking and biting,

76
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:59,523
息もできなくて
unable to even breathe,

77
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:04,423
騒ぐ頭と腹の奥がぐしゃぐしゃになったって
Even if my noisy head and gut get all messed up.

78
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,923
衒いも外連も
Even the pretense and theatrics,

79
00:12:06,923 --> 00:12:09,423
消えてしまうくらいに
to the point they disappear,

80
00:12:09,423 --> 00:12:11,723
今は触っていたいんだ
I want to touch it right now,

81
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:14,323
君の心に
Touch your heart.

82
00:12:15,523 --> 00:12:18,023
僕たちはきっといつか遠く離れた
We surely reached out far someday,

83
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:20,523
太陽にすら手が届いて
even reaching the sun,

84
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:22,923
夜明け前を手に入れて笑おう
Let's seize the time before dawn and laugh.

85
00:12:25,423 --> 00:12:27,923
そうやって青く燃える色に染まり
Dyed in that burning blue color,

86
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:30,323
おぼろげな街の向こうへ
towards the other side of the hazy city,

87
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:32,823
手をつないで走っていけるはずだ
we should be able to run hand in hand.

88
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:37,723
君と未来を盗み描く
Stealing and sketching the future with you,

89
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,023
ひねりのないストーリーを
a story with no twists.

90
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:52,323
カサブタだらけ荒くれた日々が
Those rough days covered in scabs,

91
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:54,823
削り削られ擦り切れた今が
this worn-out present, whittled down,

92
00:12:54,823 --> 00:12:57,223
君の言葉で蘇る
are revived by your words,

93
00:12:57,223 --> 00:12:59,723
鮮やかにも現れていく
appearing so vividly.

94
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:02,123
蛹のままで眠る魂を
The soul sleeping inside the chrysalis,

95
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:04,723
食べかけのまま捨てたあの夢を
that dream thrown away half-eaten,

96
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:07,123
もう一度取り戻すよ
I'll take them back once more!

97
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:17,323
Oh-oh-oh...

98
00:13:18,523 --> 00:13:26,323
Oh-oh-oh...

99
00:13:26,323 --> 00:13:28,923
もう一度 遠くへ行け
Go far away once more!

100
00:13:28,923 --> 00:13:30,123
遠くへ行けと
Go far away!

101
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:32,723
僕の中で誰かが歌う
Someone is singing inside me.

102
00:13:32,723 --> 00:13:36,423
どうしようもないほど熱烈に
So passionately that I can't help it.

103
00:13:36,423 --> 00:13:38,823
いつだって目を腫らした
My eyes were always swollen,

104
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:41,223
君が二度と悲しまないように
So that you would never be sad again,

105
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:45,023
笑えるそんなヒーローになるための歌
A song to become a hero who can laugh.

106
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:48,823
さらば掲げろピースサイン
Farewell, raise your peace sign!

107
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:51,323
転がっていくストーリーを
Let this rolling story go on.

108
00:13:51,323 --> 00:13:53,623
君と未来を盗み描く
Stealing and sketching the future with you,

109
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:56,023
ひねりのないストーリーを
a story with no twists.

110
00:14:08,523 --> 00:14:10,523
考えたってわからないし
Even if I think about it, I don't understand.

111
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:12,723
青空の下、君を待った
I waited for you under the blue sky.

112
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:14,623
風が吹いた正午
At noon when the wind blew,

113
00:14:14,623 --> 00:14:16,823
昼下がりを抜け出す想像
I imagined escaping the early afternoon.

114
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,423
ねぇ、これからどうなるんだろうね
Hey, I wonder what will happen from now on.

115
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:21,523
進め方教わらないんだよ
No one taught us how to proceed.

116
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:22,623
君の目を見た
I looked into your eyes.

117
00:14:22,623 --> 00:14:24,423
何も言えず僕は歩いた
Saying nothing, I just walked.

118
00:14:39,923 --> 00:14:41,823
考えたってわからないし
Even if I think about it, I don't understand.

119
00:14:41,823 --> 00:14:43,923
青春なんてつまらないし
Youth is just boring.

120
00:14:43,923 --> 00:14:45,823
辞めたはずのピアノ
The piano I was supposed to have quit,

121
00:14:45,823 --> 00:14:47,623
机を弾く癖が抜けない
I can't stop the habit of playing on my desk.

122
00:14:47,623 --> 00:14:49,723
ねぇ、将来何してるだろうね
Hey, I wonder what we'll be doing in the future.

123
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,223
音楽はしてないといいね
I hope I'm not doing music.

124
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:54,023
困らないでよ
Don't look so troubled.

125
00:14:54,023 --> 00:15:00,023
心の中に...
Inside my heart...

126
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:01,871
たって全部
...all of it,

127
00:15:01,871 --> 00:15:04,171
どうしても消えなかった
Just wouldn't disappear no matter what.

128
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:06,171
今更なんだからなぁ
It's too late for that now.

129
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,871
もう
Don't...

130
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:10,171
思い出すな
Don't remember it.

131
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:11,771
間違ってるんだよ
You've got it all wrong.

132
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:12,771
わかってないよ
You don't understand.

133
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:13,871
あんたら人間も
Not you people,

134
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,471
本当も愛も世界も苦しさも人生も
Not truth, love, the world, pain, or life.

135
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:17,671
どうでもいいよ
It doesn't matter anymore.

136
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:19,971
正しいかどうかが知りたいのだって
Even wanting to know if it's right,

137
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:21,571
防衛本能だ
Is just a defensive instinct.

138
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:22,571
考えたんだ
I thought about it.

139
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:24,571
あんたのせいだ
It's all your fault.

140
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,271
考えたってわからないが
I think about it, but I don't understand.

141
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:43,071
本当に年老いたくないんだ
I really don't want to get old.

142
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:44,771
いつか死んだらって
Thinking about dying someday,

143
00:15:44,771 --> 00:15:47,071
思うだけで胸が空っぽになるんだ
Just the thought leaves my heart empty.

144
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,071
将来何してるだろうって
"What will I be doing in the future?"

145
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:51,671
大人になったらわかったよ
When I became an adult, I understood.

146
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:53,671
何もしてないさ
I'm not doing anything.

147
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,571
幸せな
Those with happy...

148
00:15:56,571 --> 00:16:00,671
顔した人が憎いのは
...faces are hateful to me.

149
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:02,871
どう割り切ったらいいんだ
How am I supposed to accept this?

150
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:05,971
満たされない頭の奥の
Deep inside my unsatisfied mind...

151
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:07,771
化け物みたいだ
...it's like a monster.

152
00:16:08,371 --> 00:16:09,671
劣等感
Inferiority complex.

153
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:11,871
間違ってないよな
I'm not wrong, am I?

154
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:14,371
何だかんだあんたら人間だ
After all is said and done, you're just humans.

155
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:17,071
愛も救いも優しさも根拠がないなんて
To say love, salvation, and kindness have no basis...

156
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:18,971
気味が悪いよ
...is just creepy.

157
00:16:18,971 --> 00:16:21,471
ラブソングなんかが痛いのだって
Even finding love songs painful...

158
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:23,171
防衛本能だ
...is a defensive instinct.

159
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:24,471
どうでもいいか
Does it even matter?

160
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:26,371
あんたのせいだ
It's all your fault.

161
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:42,271
考えたってわからないし
Thinking about it doesn't help,

162
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:44,271
生きてるだけでも苦しいし
Just living is painful enough,

163
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,371
音楽とか儲からないし
Music doesn't make money anyway,

164
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:48,371
歌詞とか適当でもいいよ
Lyrics can be whatever.

165
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:52,071
どうでもいいんだ
I don't care anymore.

166
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:57,471
間違ってないだろ
I'm not wrong, right?

167
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:01,371
間違ってないよな
I'm not wrong, am I?

168
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:06,571
間違ってないよな
I'm not wrong, am I?

169
00:17:16,271 --> 00:17:17,871
間違ってるんだよ
I'm actually wrong.

170
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,071
わかってるんだ
I know that.

171
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,171
あんたら人間も
You humans,

172
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:22,571
本当も愛も救いも優しさも人生も
Truth, love, salvation, kindness, life...

173
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:23,771
どうでもいいんだ
None of it matters.

174
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:26,171
正しい答えが言えないのだって
Being unable to give the right answer...

175
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,771
防衛本能だ
...is a defensive instinct.

176
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:29,071
どうでもいいや
Whatever.

177
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:30,871
あんたのせいだ
It's all your fault.

178
00:17:30,871 --> 00:17:39,071
Ahhh...

179
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:42,371
僕だって信念があった
I had beliefs too, you know.

180
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:45,071
今じゃ塵みたいな想いだ
Now those feelings are just like dust.

181
00:17:45,071 --> 00:17:47,371
何度でも君を書いた
I wrote about you again and again.

182
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:49,971
売れることこそがどうでもよかったんだ
I truly didn't care about selling.

183
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:51,571
本当だ
It's true.

184
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,371
本当なんだ
I really mean it.

185
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:55,771
昔はそうだった
That's how it used to be.

186
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:57,971
だから僕は
That's why I...

187
00:18:00,071 --> 00:18:02,171
だから僕は
That's why I...

188
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:05,571
音楽を辞めた
...gave up on music.

189
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,571
今なんじゃない
Now is the time!

190
00:18:20,571 --> 00:18:22,371
メラメラとたぎれ
Burn fiercely!

191
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:25,071
眠っているだけの正義
Justice that is merely sleeping.

192
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,271
こんな僕も
Even someone like me,

193
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:30,971
君のヒーローになりたいのさ
I want to be your hero!

194
00:18:33,771 --> 00:18:47,371
La la la...

195
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:49,771
かっこいい君には
To the cool you,

196
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:54,071
僕じゃ頼りないのかなんて
Thinking "I might be unreliable"...

197
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:57,071
そりゃそうだよな だって
Well that's only natural, because,

198
00:18:57,071 --> 00:19:00,671
今もこうして迷ってる
Even now, I'm hesitating like this.

199
00:19:01,371 --> 00:19:04,971
La la la... 手を取ってくれないか
La la la... Won't you take my hand?

200
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:07,471
ギブとテイクさ
It's give and take.

201
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:12,771
君が僕のヒーローだったように
Just like you were my hero.

202
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,871
今なんじゃない
Now is the time!

203
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:18,471
メラメラとたぎる
Burning fiercely!

204
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:21,871
こんな僕にも潜む正義が
The justice hidden even within me.

205
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:24,471
どうしようもない衝動に駆られて
Driven by an uncontrollable impulse,

206
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:28,171
ほら気付けば手を握っている
Look, before I knew it, I was holding your hand.

207
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:29,871
一体全体
What in the world?

208
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:34,571
そんなに荷物を背負い込んでどこへ行くの
Where are you going carrying all that burden?

209
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:36,571
ねえねえ待って
Hey, wait up.

210
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:39,971
僕にちょっと預けてみては
Why don't you let me carry some of it?

211
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:59,271
信じてばかりの僕と
With me, who just keeps believing...

212
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:07,046
どちらが正しいのかなんて
I don't think anyone knows...

213
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:10,546
誰にもわからないさ
...which side is truly right.

214
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:12,846
ラララララ
La la la la la

215
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,146
僕らだけの世界
A world belonging only to us.

216
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:17,046
ラララララ
La la la la la

217
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:19,446
ギブアンドテイクさ
It's all give and take.

218
00:20:19,646 --> 00:20:21,046
ラララララ
La la la la la

219
00:20:21,246 --> 00:20:24,346
補い合えた暁には
When we finally complete each other,

220
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:26,546
同じ夢を見たい
I want us to dream the same dream.

221
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:43,146
君はかっこいいと
You were so cool,

222
00:20:43,146 --> 00:20:47,146
苦しめてひとりぼっちにさせたのは
but I hurt you and left you all alone.

223
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,446
少し僕のせいなんだよな
That was partly my fault, wasn't it?

224
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:53,046
ごめんね
I'm sorry.

225
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:56,846
だけど見るべきはリアルだ
But what we need to face is reality.

226
00:20:57,146 --> 00:20:59,846
今こそ僕が助けるんだ
Now is the time for me to save you.

227
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:03,446
抱えないで信じて
Don't bear it alone, believe in me,

228
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:06,346
頼ってほしいんだ
I want you to rely on me!

229
00:21:11,446 --> 00:21:13,246
今なんじゃない？
Isn't now the time?

230
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:16,046
メラメラとたぎる
Burning and flaring up,

231
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:19,046
こんな僕にも潜む正義が
the justice hidden even within me.

232
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:23,046
どうしようもない衝動に駆られて
Driven by a helpless impulse,

233
00:21:23,046 --> 00:21:25,546
ほら気付けば手を握っている
look, I'm holding your hand before I knew it.

234
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:28,046
放っておけない
I can't leave you alone.

235
00:21:28,046 --> 00:21:31,046
そんなに荷物を背負い込んで
Taking on so many burdens,

236
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:32,446
どこへ行くの
where are you going?

237
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:35,046
ほんのちょっと
Just a little bit,

238
00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:38,246
僕にちょっと預けてみては？
why not entrust a little bit to me?

239
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:41,346
こんな僕も
Even someone like me,

240
00:21:41,346 --> 00:21:45,346
君のヒーローになりたいのさ
I want to become your hero.

241
00:21:46,846 --> 00:21:50,046
ラララララ ラララララ
La la la la la, la la la la la

so please, I ask for your support with that.

255
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:48,346
一曲目に歌った『Mela!』は
The first song I sang, 'Mela!',

256
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:51,346
実は初配信で歌うか悩んでいた楽曲だったので
was actually a song I debated singing in my debut stream,

257
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:53,646
ここで歌えてすごくよかった
so I'm really glad I could sing it here.

258
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:55,346
ありがとう
Thank you.

259
00:22:56,246 --> 00:22:59,046
小さい頃からね ヒロインよりヒーローになりたいっていう
Since I was little, I was the type who wanted to be a hero

260
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,646
タイプだったので
rather than a heroine,

261
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,846
そういった楽曲をたくさん歌わせていただきました
so I've been allowed to sing many songs like that.

262
00:23:03,346 --> 00:23:05,146
次からは ありがとうねみんな
From here on... thank you everyone,

263
00:23:05,146 --> 00:23:06,646
拍手もありがとう
thank you for the applause.

264
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:08,546
次からはロックで！
From here on, it's Rock!

265
00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:11,846
感情をぶつけるような歌に挑戦しますんで
I'll challenge a song where I can slam my emotions...

266
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:14,346
ちょっとマイクがね
Wait, the mic is a bit...

267
00:23:14,346 --> 00:23:16,046
挑戦しますんで
I'll challenge it!

268
00:23:16,346 --> 00:23:18,846
聴いてください 『劣等上等』
Please listen: 'Rettou Joutou' (Bring It On).

269
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:34,046
Yeah!

270
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,046
Grow up!

271
00:23:36,746 --> 00:23:38,246
Give up!

272
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:40,746
劣等上等 BRING IT ON
Inferiority, fine by me, BRING IT ON!

273
00:23:41,246 --> 00:23:42,546
劣等上等
Inferiority, fine by me!

274
00:23:45,346 --> 00:23:47,046
劣等上等 BRING IT ON
Inferiority, fine by me, BRING IT ON!

275
00:23:47,846 --> 00:23:49,746
劣等上等 不眠日本
Inferiority, fine by me, sleepless Japan.

276
00:23:50,146 --> 00:23:51,946
子供騙しのマセマティカ
Child-deceiving mathematica,

277
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:54,646
バレてんだってそんなのってプライドがない
it's obvious, you have no pride like that.

278
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:58,346
ご立派 警鐘 気取りで
Acting like a splendid warning bell,

279
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:01,346
紙の刑罰ばっかでつまんない
it's boring with just paper punishments.

280
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:03,446
ほらもっと 間違って上等
Come on, make more mistakes, it's fine!

281
00:24:04,146 --> 00:24:06,046
退屈に手をかけて
Lay your hands on the boredom.

282
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,646
ママ やっぱあたしは
Mama, after all, I...

283
00:24:09,646 --> 00:24:11,846
こんなところじゃ終われない
...can't end in a place like this.

284
00:24:13,246 --> 00:24:15,546
ぬるくて気が触れそう
It's so lukewarm I might go crazy.

285
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:18,546
ごっこ遊びも芝居もさよなら
Goodbye to make-believe and acting.

286
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:21,046
ずっとこのままなんてさ
Staying like this forever...

287
00:24:21,746 --> 00:24:23,246
いらないよ
I don't need it!

288
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,546
だだだ あたし大人になる
I'm going to become an adult,

289
00:24:26,546 --> 00:24:29,646
酸いも甘いも噛み分けて
tasting both the bitter and the sweet.

290
00:24:30,246 --> 00:24:32,246
今 パパパ変わる時代
Now, the times are changing,

291
00:24:32,446 --> 00:24:35,346
悪いことばっかじゃないでしょう
it's not all bad things, right?

292
00:24:36,046 --> 00:24:38,246
過去も罪も罰も
The past, the sins, the punishments,

293
00:24:38,246 --> 00:24:40,046
すべて飲み込んで
swallow them all,

294
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:42,846
愛で生き抜いてやりこうんだわ
and survive with love!

295
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:49,646
Yeah 挑発
Yeah, provocation.

296
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:51,046
あたしたちは No Doubt
We are No Doubt.

297
00:24:51,246 --> 00:24:53,646
緑のアイツにばっか構ってんね
You're only paying attention to that green guy.

298
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:56,246
さあ Burn up いつまた
Come on, Burn up, when will we...

299
00:24:56,346 --> 00:24:58,246
もらえる合格
...get a passing grade again?

300
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:00,046
赤ペンいれてよ どこがダメなんですか
Correct it with a red pen, what's wrong with it?

301
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:03,194
ちょっと　混む　劣等感
A little congested, inferiority complex.

302
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:05,194
散っても　いいんじゃない？
Isn't it fine even if we scatter?

303
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:06,994
冗談じゃない　ブラックジョーク

騒ぐ頭の中を
Stirring up the noise inside her head,

433
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:53,269
掻き回して、掻き回して
stirring it up, stirring it up.

434
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:08,569
「問題ない。」と呟いた
"No problem," were the words she murmured,

435
00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:13,569
言葉は失われた
but those words were lost.

436
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:18,069
もう失敗、もう失敗

00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,369
と、少女は言う
So the girl says,

441
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:38,269
少女は言う
the girl says,

442
00:34:38,569 --> 00:34:42,569
言葉に意味を奏でながら！
while playing meaning into her words!

443
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:46,569
「もう良いかい？」
"Are you ready?"

444
00:34:46,569 --> 00:34:48,569
「まだですよ、
"Not just yet,

445
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:52,569
まだまだ先は見えないので。息を止めるの、今。」
the future is still invisible. So stop your breathing, now."

446
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:02,917
もう一回、もう一回
One more time, one more time,

447
00:35:03,617 --> 00:35:06,617
重なる声と声を
Mixing voices with overlapping voices,

448
00:35:07,117 --> 00:35:11,617
混ぜ合わせて、混ぜ合わせて
blending them together, blending them together.

449
00:35:12,117 --> 00:35:15,617
「問題ない。」と呟いた
"No problem," I murmured.

450
00:35:16,117 --> 00:35:21,117
言葉は西へ流れた
The words drifted away to the west.

451
00:35:22,117 --> 00:35:24,617
どうなったって良いんだってさ
It doesn't matter what happens,

452
00:35:25,117 --> 00:35:27,617
間違いだって起こしちゃおうと
I might as well make a mistake,

453
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,617
誘う、坂道
the slope invites me.

454
00:35:32,617 --> 00:35:34,117
もう一回、もう一回
One more time, one more time,

455
00:35:34,617 --> 00:35:37,117
私をどうか転がして
please just let me roll.

456
00:35:37,617 --> 00:35:40,117
少女は言う 少女は言う
The girl says, the girl says,

457
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:42,617
無口に意味を重ねながら
layering meaning into silence!

458
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:44,317
「もう良いかい？」
"Are you ready?"

459
00:35:44,617 --> 00:35:47,617
「もう少し、もうすぐ何か見えるだろうと」
"Just a little more, I'll see something soon."

460
00:35:48,117 --> 00:35:51,117
息を止めるの、今
Hold your breath, now.

461
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,117
もう一回、もう一回
One more time, one more time,

462
00:35:54,617 --> 00:35:57,117
「私は今日も転がります。」と
"I will roll again today."

463
00:35:57,617 --> 00:35:59,617
少女は言う 少女は言う
The girl says, the girl says,

464
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:02,117
言葉に意味を奏でながら！
playing meaning into words!

465
00:36:02,617 --> 00:36:04,617
「もう良いかい？もう良いよ。
"Are you ready? I'm ready.

466
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:08,617
そろそろ君も疲れたろう、ね。」
You must be tired by now, right?"

467
00:36:09,117 --> 00:36:12,117
息を止めるの、今
Hold your breath, now.

468
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:25,617
今度こそ生き返れない
I thought I couldn't come back to life

469
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,617
そう思った ベッドの中
this time, in my bed.

470
00:36:29,117 --> 00:36:32,117
気付けばカーテンの隙間から
Before I knew it, through the gap in the curtains,

471
00:36:33,117 --> 00:36:35,617
朝が焦りを教えた
the morning taught me impatience.

472
00:36:36,117 --> 00:36:38,617
あぁ、生きてたと安堵
Ah, relief that I was alive.

473
00:36:39,117 --> 00:36:42,117
あぁ、生きてしまったと絶望
Ah, despair that I ended up living.

474
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,317
まだやれるのか
Can I still do it?

475
00:36:44,617 --> 00:36:46,617
まだやらなきゃなのか
Do I still have to do it?

476
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:51,617
いっそ無理やりも変えてしまえば
If I could just forcibly change it...

477
00:36:52,117 --> 00:36:54,117
なんてね
Just kidding.

478
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:00,917
僕は元気です
I am fine.

479
00:37:01,117 --> 00:37:03,617
そう言って今日も笑って
Saying that, I laugh again today.

480
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:06,617
心はガランドウです
My heart is empty.

481
00:37:07,117 --> 00:37:11,117
大袈裟な音がする
It makes an exaggerated sound.

482
00:37:12,117 --> 00:37:16,117
終末の鐘の音か
Is it the sound of the doomsday bell?

483
00:37:21,117 --> 00:37:23,617
それでもこの声が
Even so, this voice,

484
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,617
それでもこの口が
even so, this mouth,

485
00:37:27,117 --> 00:37:29,117
それでもこの喉が
even so, this throat...

486
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:34,117
千切れるくらい叫ぶよ
I'll scream until it tears apart.

487
00:37:35,117 --> 00:37:36,617
この腕が
These arms,

488
00:37:37,117 --> 00:37:39,117
真っ白なこの羽が
these pure white wings,

489
00:37:39,617 --> 00:37:42,617
僕のこの命が
my life itself,

490
00:37:43,117 --> 00:37:46,617
生きたいと歌ってる
is singing that it wants to live.

491
00:37:48,117 --> 00:37:50,117
出来るなら愛されたい
If possible, I want to be loved.

492
00:37:50,617 --> 00:37:54,117
許されたい ここに居たい 愛したい
I want to be forgiven, I want to be here, I want to love.

493
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:58,117
誰も見てない 夢を見るよ
I dream a dream that no one sees.

494
00:37:59,117 --> 00:38:02,617
だから 僕を見てろよ
So, keep your eyes on me.

495
00:38:08,117 --> 00:38:10,617
感情の捨て方はさ
To throw away emotions,

496
00:38:11,117 --> 00:38:14,117
粗大ゴミのシールを貼る
just stick an oversized trash sticker on them.

497
00:38:15,117 --> 00:38:18,117
本音はいつも強がりの裏
My true feelings are always behind my bravado.

498
00:38:19,117 --> 00:38:21,617
潰れる音がするんだ
I hear the sound of them being crushed.

499
00:38:22,117 --> 00:38:24,617
あぁ 気付かれなかった
Ah, nobody noticed.

500
00:38:25,117 --> 00:38:27,617
あぁ 気付いて欲しかった
Ah, I wanted someone to notice.

501
00:38:28,117 --> 00:38:31,117
それでも君が笑ってくれるなら
Even so, if you smile for me,

502
00:38:32,117 --> 00:38:36,117
いっそ心を無くしてしまえば
I should just lose my heart entirely.

503
00:38:36,617 --> 00:38:38,617
なんてね
Just kidding.

504
00:38:51,617 --> 00:38:53,117
叶わないなんて
That it won't come true,

505
00:38:53,617 --> 00:38:56,617
一瞬でも思ったら負けだ
if I think that for even a second, I lose.

506
00:38:58,117 --> 00:39:00,117
叶わないなんて
That it won't come true,

507
00:39:00,617 --> 00:39:03,617
一瞬でもよぎったら辞めな
if it crosses your mind for even a second, quit it.

508
00:39:05,117 --> 00:39:09,617
何万の諦める理由があったとしても
Even if there are tens of thousands of reasons to give up,

509
00:39:11,117 --> 00:39:17,117
ただ一つの勇気がその手の中に
there is just one courage in those hands.

510
00:39:21,117 --> 00:39:23,617
それでもこの声が
Even so, this voice,

511
00:39:24,117 --> 00:39:26,617
それでもこの口が
even so, this mouth,

512
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:29,617
それでもこの喉が
even so, this throat...

513
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:34,117
千切れるくらい叫ぶよ
I'll scream until it tears apart.

514
00:39:34,617 --> 00:39:35,917
この腕が
These arms,

515
00:39:36,117 --> 00:39:38,317
真っ白なこの羽が
these pure white wings,

516
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:41,617
僕のこの命が
my life itself,

517
00:39:42,117 --> 00:39:46,117
生きたいと歌ってる
is singing that it wants to live.

518
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:49,617
出来るなら愛されたい
If possible, I want to be loved.

519
00:39:50,117 --> 00:39:53,117
許されたい ここに居たい 愛したい
I want to be forgiven, I want to be here, I want to love.

520
00:39:54,117 --> 00:39:57,117
誰も見てない 夢を見るよ
I dream a dream that no one sees.

521
00:39:58,117 --> 00:40:01,117
だから 僕を見てろよ
So, keep your eyes on me.

522
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:04,992
誰も見ていない夢を見せるよ
I will show you a dream that no one sees.

523
00:40:04,992 --> 00:40:09,592
だから 僕を信じて
So, believe in me.

524
00:40:40,092 --> 00:40:41,592
はい！皆さん
Yes! Everyone!

525

That was my final original song.

00:40:45,392 --> 00:40:48,592

'Dream a Dream No One Sees'...

527
00:40:48,892 --> 00:40:51,592
本日24時にリリース！
Releases today at 24:00!

528

529
00:40:54,092 --> 00:40:57,092
頼りに探してくださいね 頼むよ
...as a guide to find it. I'm counting on you.

530
00:40:57,592 --> 00:41:03,092
いや この曲あまりにも卒業ソングすぎるって思ったでしょう
You probably thought, 'This song is way too much like a graduation song,' right?

531
00:41:03,092 --> 00:41:06,592
これ実は卒業決める前に作られていた曲で
Actually, this song was made before I even decided to graduate.

532
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:09,592
卒業決める前に あ MVは明日ね
Before I decided... Ah, the MV is out tomorrow.

533
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:13,092
明日の20時 もうかなたそがいなくなっても
Tomorrow at 20:00. Even if Kanata-so is gone...

534
00:41:13,092 --> 00:41:15,592
予約投稿というものがある ネットには
...'scheduled upload' exists on the internet.

535
00:41:15,592 --> 00:41:18,092
ということで明日の20時に投稿されるんですが
So it will be posted tomorrow at 20:00.

536
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:22,592
内容も実は 卒業誰も知らずに作っているということで
The content was actually made without anyone knowing about the graduation.

537
00:41:23,092 --> 00:41:26,592
なんかこんな偶然の一致で それっぽくなってしまいました
It just ended up sounding like that by pure coincidence.

538
00:41:27,092 --> 00:41:30,092
それを踏まえてまた なんでやねんと思いながら
Keeping that in mind, while thinking 'What the heck?'...

539
00:41:30,092 --> 00:41:33,592
聴いてください ヒグチアイさんにね 作詞作曲していただいて
...please listen to it. Higuchi Ai-san wrote and composed it.

540
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:36,592
あの「悪魔の子」をね いっぱい歌ったりしたんで
I've sung 'Akuma no Ko' a lot...

青い薔薇というものをね 最初からちょっとモチーフ的に
Also, the blue rose motif has been there since the beginning...

We ain't letting you quit alone.

609
00:44:39,092 --> 00:44:41,592
やだ！ ゲストいないので！
No! There are no guests!

610
00:44:41,592 --> 00:44:42,592

We are here!

611
00:44:42,592 --> 00:44:44,092
一人で辞めさせないよ
We won't let you quit alone!

612
00:44:44,092 --> 00:44:45,592
寂しいだろ！
It'd be lonely, right?!

613
00:44:45,592 --> 00:44:47,092
一人で辞めさせないよ
We won't let you quit alone!

614
00:44:47,092 --> 00:44:48,592

00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:58,592
ころさんとラミトワちゃんがなんか
Koro-san and Lamy-Towa-chan...

619
00:44:58,592 --> 00:44:59,892
来てくれました！
...somehow came here!

620
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,640
え？
Eh?

621
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,140
ちょっと我々から渡したいものがありますよね？
We actually have something we want to give you, right?

622
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,640
何？何？マジで聞いてない、知らない！何？
What? What? I seriously haven't heard about this! I don't know! What?

623
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,640
マジで言ってない！マジで言ってない！
We seriously didn't tell you! We seriously didn't!

624
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,640
え、何！？
Eh, what is it?!

625
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,640

Oh no, wait...

626
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,140

627
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,140
はい、どうぞー！

628
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,140
ありがとう！
Thank you!

629
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,640
持てないか、持てないよね。
Can't hold it? You can't hold it, right.

630
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,640
あーすごい！
Ah, amazing!

631
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,140
これ3人で選んだ...
The three of us chose this...

632
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,140
花束？
A bouquet?

633
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,140
そう！
Yes!

634
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,140
お花です！
It's flowers!

635
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,140
え、すごい！なんかとても美しいバラみたいな感じの...
Eh, wow! It looks like very beautiful roses...

636
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,140
バーチャル空間には映らないんだけど...
It doesn't show up in this virtual space, but...

637
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,140
そう、ちょっと映んないんですけど...
Right, it doesn't really show up, but...

638
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,640
僕だけのものです、みんな。
It belongs only to me, everyone.

639
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,140
え、すごい！こんなにでかい花束もらったことない！
Eh, wow! I've never received such a huge bouquet!

640
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,640
じゃ一旦回収します。
Okay, we'll take it back for now.

641
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,640
あ、すいません。ありがとうございます。
Ah, sorry. Thank you.

642
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,140
それとね、3人で寄せ書きもして...
Also, the three of us wrote a message card together...

643
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,140
えー！
Ehh?!

644
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,140

We did!

645
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,140

Thank you!

646
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,140
嬉しい！
I'm so happy!

647
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,640
やだ、こんな今見たら泣いちゃう！
Oh no, if I look at it now, I'll cry!

648
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,140
じゃあ...
Then...

649
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,140
没収します！
We'll confiscate it!

650
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,640
また後でね！ありがとう！
Later then! Thank you!

651
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:03,140
みんな...え、待って待って、嫌だ、本当嫌だ！
Everyone... Eh, wait, wait, no! I really don't want this!

652
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,640
え、辞める？辞めるの？
Eh, are you quitting? Are you quitting?

653
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,640
ここね、ここがいいね！
Right here, this is a good spot!

654
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,640
ここで辞めて大団円をするんですけど...
We'll end it right here for a grand finale...

655
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,640
だっていいよね？
It's fine, right?

656
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,140
3人も背負ってくれるってことで一緒に...
Since the three of you will bear the burden together...

657
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,140
背負う、背負う！
We'll bear it, we'll bear it!

658
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,640
背負うよ！
We'll bear it!

659
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,640
心強！
So reassuring!

660
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,140
明日初配信しよ、明日初配信！
Let's do our debut stream tomorrow! Debut stream tomorrow!

661
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:21,140
明日ね、切り替えて初配信しよう！
Tomorrow, yeah, let's switch gears and do a debut stream!

662
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,140
切り替えていくか...いやもうありがとうみんな。
Switch gears, huh... No, really, thank you everyone.

663
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:27,140
もう嬉しい...！
I'm so happy...!

664
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,640
めちゃめちゃ頼んだの、会いに来たいって。
I really, really asked them to come see me.

665
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,640
そうなの！
That's right!

666
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,140
もう1人で、なんか勝手にいろんなもの背負ってさ！
She was taking on all sorts of burdens all by herself!

667
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,140
そうだよ！
Exactly!

668
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,140
辞めていくなんて許せない！逃さないと言ったから！
I won't forgive you if you quit! I said I wouldn't let you get away!

669
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,140
ありがとう！
Thank you!

670
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,640

00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,140
頼れ頼れ！
Rely on us, rely on us!

673
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:44,640
ありがとう！
Thank you!

674
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,640
でもそこで、ちょっと無理を言って...
But still, I asked a bit of a selfish favor...

675
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,140
今日駆けつけさせていただきました！
And we rushed over here today!

676
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:54,140
本当に、本当に本当にすごいこと...
Really, it's truly, truly amazing...

677

行っちゃうの？
Are you going?

681
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,140
行かない！お前が行くんだよ！
I'm not going! YOU are the one going!

682
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,140
お前が行くんだよ！
You're the one going!

683
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,640
先に引くんだ！行っちゃうの残念だなー！
We're stepping back first! Too bad you're going!

684
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,140

689
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,640
まだ泣かないよ、まだあるからね。
I won't cry yet, there's still more to go.

690
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,640
まだあるもんね！
There's still more, right!

691
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,140

縁側で語り明かそうね！
Let's chat all night on the porch!

703
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,640
おばあちゃんになってね...そこで見てるから！
When we become grandmas... We'll be watching from there!

ええ...
Ehh...

714
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:57,140
今回、あのみんなに説明した感じで...
This time, like I explained to everyone...

715
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,140
もうゲストはね、今回は呼べないけど...
I said I couldn't invite any guests this time...

716
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,140
勘弁よって言ってたんですけど...
I said, 'Please spare me'...

717
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:06,140
ころさんとあずちゃんとロボ子が来てくれました。
But Koro-san, Azu-chan, and Roboco came anyway.

オリジナル楽曲が続いていきます。
We'll continue with original songs.

721
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,140
歌えるのはね、最後になってしまうんですが...
This will be the last time I can sing them, but...

722
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,140
だからこそ、たくさんの思い出を思い出しながら...
That's exactly why, while remembering all the memories...

723
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:26,140
心を込めて歌っていこうと思います。
I want to sing with all my heart.

724
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,140
ちょっと待って、びっくりした...
Wait a sec, I was surprised...

725
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,140

きみのキューピッドです　向かう夢中
I am your cupid, heading into a trance

732
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:09,640

736
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,140
ついに鳴った着信音
The ringtone finally rang

00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,640
やだやだやだやだ！
No no no no!

738
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,140
強制直帰の５時半
Forced to go home at 5:30

739
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,140
やだやだやだやだ！

740
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,140
誰か頑張ってるエレベーター
Someone's trying hard, elevator

やだやだやだやだ！
No no no no!

742
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,640
そう我らこそ陰の者
Yes, we are the gloomy ones

743
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,140
笑おう　笑おう　せめて笑おう
Let's laugh, let's laugh, let's at least laugh

744
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,140
あはは...無理...帰りたい...
Ahaha... I can't... I want to go home...

745
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,140
来ない　来ない　渇きまくり
Not coming, not coming, totally parched

746
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,140
反省　反省　また反省だ
Regret, regret, regret again

747
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,140
鏡ですらも恐ろしいんだ
Even mirrors are terrifying

748
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,140
明日は今日より
Tomorrow, more than today...

749
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,140
人間になりたい
I want to become human!

750
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,140

These hands protect me,

758
00:50:16,315 --> 00:50:18,615
そのためあったのね

00:50:20,915 --> 00:50:23,315
雑踏に君と僕は

弱気なときは瞼 ぎゅっと瞑り
when you're feeling weak, squeeze your eyelids shut.

Without being able to tell anyone,

1041
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:13,686
描いた夢が 例え叶わないとしても
even if the dreams I drew don't come true,

1042
01:09:13,986 --> 01:09:16,986
ボロボロの靴でも
even with worn-out shoes,

1043
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,586
カッコよくなくても
even if it's not cool,

1044
01:09:19,586 --> 01:09:23,586
あの日の僕ならなんて言う？
what would the 'me' from that day say?

1045
01:09:23,586 --> 01:09:26,286
止まらないで
'Don't stop.'

1046
01:09:26,686 --> 01:09:31,686
初めて僕ら出逢った日
The day we first met,

1047

まるで昨日みたいに思い出すけど
I remember it like it was yesterday, but

1048

01:09:39,286 --> 01:09:44,386
最後に今 重なる奇跡
