人混みに馴染まないように
So as not to blend in with the crowd

4
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,500
愛されないように
So as not to be loved

5
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,300
期待しないように
So as not to have expectations

6
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,800
かと言って角が立たないように
But also so as not to cause any friction

7
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,800
気取らぬように
So as not to be pretentious

8
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,400

殺さぬように
So as not to kill

12
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
かと言って正体がバレないように
But also so as not to let my true nature be exposed

13
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,000
威張らぬように
So as not to be arrogant

14
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,400
軽いジョークやリップサービスも忘れるように
So as to forget even light jokes and lip service

15
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,000
どんな時も笑って愛嬌振りまくように
So as to always smile and scatter charm around

ふざけないように
So as not to mess around

Ah lucky

160
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:39,928

目を逸らした過去も
The past you looked away from

165
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:46,288
退屈な未来も
The boring future

166
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:47,128
感性に従え
Follow your intuition

167
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:47,928

ねぇねぇねぇ なんだかどうして
Hey, hey, hey, why is it

174
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,168
戦ってるような気がするの
That I feel like I'm fighting?

175
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:06,328
止められない 止めたくもない
Can't stop, don't want to stop

176
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:07,168
今の自分
The current me

177
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:08,968
ノックノック死んでる
Knock, knock, I'm dead

178
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,768
透明な無礼で大正解
A transparent rudeness, perfectly correct

179
00:16:10,768 --> 00:16:13,528
痛い痛い 痛い記憶の奥
Ouch, ouch, deep within painful memories

180
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:15,568
残念 もういないのに
Too bad, I'm not here anymore

181
00:16:15,568 --> 00:16:17,448
あれ そっちがアイロニー
Wait, you're the one that's irony

182
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:20,528
ねえ 透かされてるのは 今の自分
Hey, the one being seen through is the current me

183
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:22,088
ナンセンス 消えないヘイト
Nonsense, the hate won't fade

184
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:24,048
癒えようがコンプレックス
Though it heals, the complex remains

185
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:26,088
取り憑かれてるみたい
I feel like I'm possessed

186
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:28,288
巻き付いたまま
Still entwined

187
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,448
まだ離れない
Still won't let go

188
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,168

Unbelievable, you and the minority

191
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:41,128
生きてることが問われ続ける形
The form where being alive is constantly questioned

192
00:16:41,128 --> 00:16:44,408
絶頂に甘んじて満足するなよ
Don't settle for the peak and be satisfied

193
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:47,528
幸せになろうとしないなんてひょーだ
Not trying to be happy is just a farce

194
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:50,928
この世この世は奇怪奇怪ファンタジー
This world, this world is a strange, strange fantasy

195
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:54,208
次は鬼が出るか蛇が出るか
Will an ogre or a snake appear next?

196
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,488
出会って会ってやっと始まる物語
Meeting and meeting, finally the story begins

敵かお化けかはのかその巨大ピースピース
Whether it's an enemy or a ghost, a giant peace peace

ねえねえねえ なんだかどうして
Hey, hey, hey, why is it

203
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,928
未来に安堵がのうのうと
That the future feels so nonchalant?

204
00:17:11,928 --> 00:17:13,528
今もまだ
Even now

もう随分生きてる
I've already lived for a long time

208

時間だテンプレート食傷
Time for the template, satiety

209
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:22,048
肯定なんて聞きごとの気配もない
No sign of any affirmation to hear

210
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:23,968
残念 詰んだ経験
Too bad, stuck experience

211
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:25,648
因果経済 正しさは退屈の進化
Causal economy, correctness is the evolution of boredom

212
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:27,368
今日は刺激を頂戴
Give me some stimulation today

213
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:28,408
飽きちゃった？
Are you bored?

214
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:29,328
投げ出した？
Did you give up?

215
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:32,408
ナンセンス 獲って代わるガイダンス
Nonsense, the guidance taking over

216
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:34,128
セルフコンプライアンス
Self-compliance

217
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:35,928
透かされてくみたい
I feel like I'm being seen through

218
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:38,008
吸い尽くして
Drain it all

219
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:40,088

いつのような過去も未来も今にあるんだ
Any past or future exists in the now

223

生きてることを愚直に果たせよ
Fulfill the fact of being alive with sincerity

幸せを諦めてしまうな 人であれ
Don't give up on happiness, be human

228
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:04,608
ただ苦しみに慣れて耐えているだけじゃ
Just getting used to and enduring pain is

死んでるも同然 しかばねのアンデッド
No different from being dead, a corpse-like undead

00:22:44,544 --> 00:22:47,844
アイ・アイ・アイスクリーム！
スクリーム！　叫びましょう！
I-I-Ice cream!
Scream! Let's shout it out!

297
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:51,244
スクリーム！　アイスクリーム！
Scream! Ice cream!

298
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:55,244
アイ・アイ・アイスクリーム！
スクリーム！　叫びましょう！
I-I-Ice cream!
Scream! Let's shout it out!

299
00:22:55,244 --> 00:22:58,844
スクリーム！　アイスクリーム！
Scream! Ice cream!

300
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:02,544
アイ・アイ・アイスクリーム！
スクリーム！　叫びましょう！
I-I-Ice cream!
Scream! Let's shout it out!

301
00:23:02,544 --> 00:23:06,044
スクリーム！　アイスクリーム！
Scream! Ice cream!

302
00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:09,544
アイ・アイ・アイスクリーム！
スクリーム！　叫びましょう！
I-I-Ice cream!
Scream! Let's shout it out!

303
00:23:09,544 --> 00:23:13,244
スクリーム！　アイスクリーム！
Scream! Ice cream!

304
00:24:09,544 --> 00:24:14,544
おー、元気もらって、面白くって、オレンジで、
Oh, someone energetic, funny, orange-themed,

305
00:24:14,544 --> 00:24:18,544
シャンパンコール得意な人いないかな？
And good at champagne calls... anyone?

306
00:24:19,044 --> 00:24:21,044
それ俺じゃないかー！
Isn't that me?!

307
00:24:43,544 --> 00:24:46,844
ちょっとでいいから見せてくれないか？
Can you show me just a little?

308
00:24:46,844 --> 00:24:50,544
お前のセクシー・フェロモンで俺メロメロ
I'm head over heels for your sexy pheromones

309
00:24:50,544 --> 00:24:53,844
潰れちゃいそうでもイケナイの？
Is it bad even if I feel like I'm going to burst?

310
00:24:53,844 --> 00:24:57,044
非常に高鳴る鼓動　止められないわ
My heart is pounding so hard, I can't stop it

311
00:24:57,044 --> 00:25:00,544
交わす言葉の記憶遠く
The memory of our exchanged words is distant

312
00:25:00,544 --> 00:25:04,044
口もと　動きに揺れ動く
Swaying with the movement of your lips

313
00:25:05,032 --> 00:25:06,382
濡れた髪をなでた
Stroked your wet hair

314
00:25:06,382 --> 00:25:08,982
そして　あーああああ
And then... ahhhh...

315
00:25:08,982 --> 00:25:11,382
ABC　続かない
ABC, it doesn't continue

316
00:25:11,382 --> 00:25:13,582
そんなんじゃダメじゃない
That's just no good, is it?

317
00:25:13,582 --> 00:25:17,382
だって心の奥は違うんじゃない?
'Cause deep down, it's different, isn't it?

318
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:20,882
オレの青春そんなもんじゃない
My youth isn't just that

319
00:25:20,882 --> 00:25:23,482
熱く奥で果てたいよ
I want to end hotly deep inside

320
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:26,382
きっと君じゃなきゃやだよ
It's gotta be you or I won't like it

321
00:25:26,382 --> 00:25:30,882
オレはイケナイ太陽
I'm the naughty sun

322
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:48,982
あー
Ah

323
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:51,482
赤い糸なんて嘘っぱち
The "red thread of fate" is just a lie

324
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:55,282
でも下心でさえ信じたいな
But even with ulterior motives, I want to believe

325
00:25:55,282 --> 00:25:58,182
オレは正しい　君も正しい
I'm right, you're right

326
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:01,982
とにかくもう左右されないぜ
Anyway, I won't be swayed anymore

327
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:05,282
飛ばした端から胸うずかせた
The fleeting moments made my heart ache

328
00:26:05,282 --> 00:26:08,782
お芝居よりも盛り上げるよ
I'll hype it up more than any play

329
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:14,182
息が耳に触れた二人ああー
Our breaths touched our ears, the two of us... ahhh...

330
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:15,982
ABC　続かない
ABC, it doesn't continue

331
00:26:16,182 --> 00:26:18,582
そんなんじゃダメじゃない
That's just no good, is it?

332
00:26:18,582 --> 00:26:22,182
だって心の奥は違うんじゃない?
'Cause deep down, it's different, isn't it?

333
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:25,282
私の青春そんなもんじゃない
My youth isn't just that

334
00:26:25,282 --> 00:26:28,282
熱く奥で果てたいよ
I want to end hotly deep inside

335
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:31,182
きっと君じゃなきゃやだよ
It's gotta be you or I won't like it

336
00:26:31,182 --> 00:26:35,482
私イケナイ太陽
I'm the naughty sun

337
00:26:59,682 --> 00:27:02,682
交わす言葉の記憶辿り
Tracing the memories of words exchanged

338
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:06,282
唇の動きにギュッと吸い込んだ
I inhaled deeply at the movement of your lips

339
00:27:06,282 --> 00:27:08,682
濡れた髪をなでた
Stroked your wet hair

340
00:27:08,682 --> 00:27:12,782
そして　あーああああ
And then... ahhhh...

341
00:27:15,182 --> 00:27:15,882
あー
Ah

342
00:27:15,882 --> 00:27:16,382
ABC

343
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:18,182
ABC　続かない
ABC, it doesn't continue

344
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:20,682
そんなんじゃダメじゃない
That's just no good, is it?

345
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:24,182
だって心の奥は違うんじゃない?
'Cause deep down, it's different, isn't it?

346
00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:27,682
俺たちの青春そんなもんじゃない
Our youth isn't just that

347
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:30,682
熱く奥で果てたいよ
I want to end hotly deep inside

348
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:33,682
きっと君じゃなきゃやだよ
It's gotta be you or I won't like it

349
00:27:33,682 --> 00:27:37,182
俺はイケナイ太陽
I'm the naughty sun

350
00:27:37,182 --> 00:27:40,682
絡み合う糸は君と俺
The intertwined threads are you and I

351
00:27:40,682 --> 00:27:45,182
俺を結ぶ赤い糸
The red thread that binds me

352
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:19,332
(吐息)
(Exhale)

353
00:28:19,332 --> 00:28:22,332
おー、はぁ、うわー！
Oh, whew, wow!

354
00:28:22,332 --> 00:28:27,532
はぁ、みんな、はぁ、来てくれて...ありがとう！
*Breathing hard* Everyone... thank you for coming... Thank you!

355

ということで、お友達が来てくれたので
So, since my friends have come,

375

雨降ってザーザー、症状自体は爺々、
It's raining pitter-patter, my condition is geezerly,

Hmm-hmm~

391
00:30:58,272 --> 00:31:03,068
まるでこの世界で
It's like in this world,

392
00:31:03,268 --> 00:31:08,568
二人だけみたいだね
we're the only two people.

393
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:14,268
なんて少しだけ
Just a little bit

394
00:31:14,468 --> 00:31:19,568
夢を見てしまっただけ
of a dream I ended up seeing.

395
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:23,068
爪先に月明かり
Moonlight on tiptoes,

396
00:31:23,268 --> 00:31:25,868
花束の香り
the scent of a bouquet,

397
00:31:26,183 --> 00:31:30,068
弓に触れる指
fingers touching the bow.

398
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:35,568
さよならもう行かなきゃ
Goodbye, I must go now,

399
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:41,568
何もかも忘れて
forget everything.

400
00:31:42,648 --> 00:31:44,268
はぁ...
Sigh...

401
00:31:44,504 --> 00:31:48,568
硝子の上を裸足のまま歩く
Walking barefoot on glass,

402
00:31:48,768 --> 00:31:54,868
痛むごとに血が流れて落ちて行く
with every pain, blood flows and drops away.

403
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:59,068
お願いその赤い
Please, follow those

404
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:02,068
足跡を辿って
red footprints,

405
00:32:02,328 --> 00:32:05,568
会いに来て
and come to see me.

406
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:21,568
錆びたプールに放たれていく金魚
Goldfish being released into a rusted pool,

407
00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:27,268
屑箱の中 隠した林檎
an apple hidden in the trash can.

408
00:32:27,568 --> 00:32:32,868
しなびた君の肌に抜ける傷跡
Scars fading on your withered skin,

409
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:37,268
犬のように泳いだ迷子
a lost child swimming like a dog.

410
00:32:37,653 --> 00:32:39,268
どこに居るよ
Where are you?

411
00:32:39,568 --> 00:32:41,868
何をしてるの
What are you doing?

412
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:45,568
この世を間違いで
Let's fill this world

413
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:48,568
満たそう
with mistakes.

414
00:32:48,915 --> 00:32:51,868
側に居たよ
I was by your side,

415
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:55,268
遊びに行こうよ
let's go play.

416
00:32:55,568 --> 00:32:58,268
どこに居るの
Where are you?

417
00:33:00,933 --> 00:33:06,268
硝子の上を裸足のまま歩く
Walking barefoot on glass,

418
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:12,568
痛むごとに血が流れて落ちて行く
with every pain, blood flows and drops away.

419
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:16,868
お願いその赤い
Please, follow those

420
00:33:17,068 --> 00:33:19,568
足跡を辿って
red footprints,

421
00:33:19,868 --> 00:33:26,068
会いに来て
and come to see me.

422
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:35,568
まるで...
It's like...

423
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:37,268
...この世界で...
...in this world...

424
00:33:37,568 --> 00:33:39,568
...二人だけ...
...we're the only two people...

425
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:42,568
...みたいだね
...isn't it?

426
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:44,868
Hmm-hmm~

427
00:33:45,068 --> 00:33:50,068
なんて少しだけ
Just a little bit

428
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:55,068
夢を見てしまっただけ
of a dream I ended up seeing.

429
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:53,868
さ、選択の時だ。
Now, it's time to choose.

430
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:01,068
コイン。
Coin.

431
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:14,956
このコインは…
This coin is...

432
00:35:15,556 --> 00:35:19,256
はは… そうか。君はそっちなんだね。
Haha... I see. You're on that side.

433
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:21,256
そっち？
That side?

434
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:23,456
ここに座って。
Sit here.

435
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,056
え…
Eh...

436
00:35:27,056 --> 00:35:29,356
この後は君次第だよ。
After this, it's up to you.

438
00:36:11,856 --> 00:36:15,856
忘れられないのはこの目のせい
The reason I can't forget is because of these eyes

439
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:19,556
赤く残る過ち 甘噛みの跡
The red mistake remaining, the mark of a love bite

440
00:36:20,256 --> 00:36:23,556
溢れ出す憂いは止め処もない
The overflowing sorrow is endless

441
00:36:23,856 --> 00:36:27,556
誰もいない間に悪魔を唆す
Tempting the devil while no one is around

442
00:36:28,056 --> 00:36:31,556
作り笑いはこの耳のせい
The reason for the fake smile is because of these ears

443
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:35,356
深い壁の中から呼びかける声
A voice calling out from deep within the walls

444
00:36:35,856 --> 00:36:39,256
Whisper Whisper Whisper まだ触らせない
Whisper Whisper Whisper, I won't let you touch yet

445
00:36:39,456 --> 00:36:43,256
この檻を抜け出して悪魔をあやかる
Escaping this cage and basking in the devil's favor

446
00:36:43,856 --> 00:36:47,356
鏡の前でこの口のせい
In front of the mirror, because of this mouth

447
00:36:47,756 --> 00:36:51,456
伝えたい言葉さえ噛み殺す夜
A night where even the words I want to say are bitten back

448
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:55,556
Whisper Whisper Whisper まだ打ち明けない
Whisper Whisper Whisper, I won't reveal it yet

449
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:59,356
神様を裏切って悪魔と過ごす
Betraying God and spending time with the devil

450
00:37:00,256 --> 00:37:03,756
I My Me 夢見ていたい あなたに
I My Me, I want to keep dreaming, for you

451
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:07,556
そっと気付かせてあげたいだけ
I just want to let you know softly

452
00:37:08,256 --> 00:37:14,556
Oh あなたにも Oh あなたにも Oh あなたにも
Oh, to you too, Oh, to you too, Oh, to you too

453
00:37:15,856 --> 00:37:19,556
Keep My 傷を隠したい あなたに
Keep My, I want to hide my wounds, from you

454
00:37:19,856 --> 00:37:23,556
そっと悩ませてあげたいだけ
I just want to make you worry softly

455
00:37:24,356 --> 00:37:28,756
Oh あなたにも Oh あなたにも
Oh, to you too, Oh, to you too

456
00:37:29,356 --> 00:37:31,356
悪魔を唆す
Tempting the devil

457
00:37:32,056 --> 00:37:35,556
作り笑いはこの耳のせい
The reason for the fake smile is because of these ears

458
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:39,356
深い壁の中から呼びかける声
A voice calling out from deep within the walls

459
00:37:39,856 --> 00:37:43,256
Whisper Whisper Whisper まだ触らせない
Whisper Whisper Whisper, I won't let you touch yet

460
00:37:43,456 --> 00:37:47,256
この檻を抜け出して悪魔をあやかる
Escaping this cage and basking in the devil's favor

461
00:37:47,856 --> 00:37:51,456
鏡の前でこの口のせい
In front of the mirror, because of this mouth

462
00:37:51,756 --> 00:37:55,456
伝えたい言葉さえ噛み殺す夜
A night where even the words I want to say are bitten back

463
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:59,456
Whisper Whisper Whisper まだ打ち明けない
Whisper Whisper Whisper, I won't reveal it yet

464
00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:03,356
神様を裏切って悪魔と過ごす
Betraying God and spending time with the devil

465

Lyrics: ryo (supercell) Composition: Giga

466
00:38:22,556 --> 00:38:25,556
好き嫌い常識 I don't care 吹っ飛べ BAN!!!
Likes, dislikes, common sense, I don't care, blow it all away, BAN!!!

467
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:29,256
かかって来いマジョリティ 私に負けはなし
Come at me, majority, there's no losing for me

468
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:33,056
ここまでって引かれた そのボーダー誰のルール
That border drawn to say 'this far,' whose rule is it?

469
00:38:33,256 --> 00:38:36,556
あの日乗り越えたウィークポイント
The weak point I overcame that day

470
00:38:36,756 --> 00:38:39,856
強くなった私が笑い飛ばしてあげる
The stronger me will laugh it off for you

471
00:38:40,556 --> 00:38:42,056
言いたいことは言う
I say what I want to say

472
00:38:42,256 --> 00:38:44,056
やりたくないことはしない
I don't do what I don't want to do

473
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:46,256
悪意気にしない
I don't care about malice

474
00:38:46,556 --> 00:38:50,356
みんな違うの当然だし 私も変わらない 目の前の自分
It's natural everyone is different, and I won't change, the self before me

475
00:38:50,556 --> 00:38:54,056
(Every single day) I want to be free

476
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:57,556
Yes まだ終わりじゃないさ それじゃ何も変えられんな
Yes, it's not over yet, if so, nothing can be changed

477
00:38:58,056 --> 00:39:01,256
(Every single day) I want it more

478
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:07,556
構わない自分勝手 生きてるんだって
I don't care about being selfish, because I'm alive

479
00:39:07,856 --> 00:39:11,056
(BAN!!! BAN!!!) 生きてるんだって
(BAN!!! BAN!!!) Because I'm alive

480
00:39:11,356 --> 00:39:14,556
(BAN!!! BAN!!!) ねえ生きてるんだって
(BAN!!! BAN!!!) Hey, because I'm alive

481
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:20,556
(BAN!!! BAN!!!) 歌えばいいのさ
(BAN!!! BAN!!!) It's fine to just sing

482
00:39:21,056 --> 00:39:25,056
抗え 生まれたその時から選んできた地点
Resist, the point you've chosen since the moment you were born

483
00:39:25,556 --> 00:39:29,056
思い出せ 私は私だ 不確かな事なんて
Remember, I am myself, uncertain things

484
00:39:29,356 --> 00:39:35,056
何一つない 嘘じゃない 鳴り響け自分に
There's not a single one, it's not a lie, ring out to yourself

485
00:39:39,556 --> 00:39:42,556
好き嫌い常識 I don't care 吹っ飛べ BAN!!!
Likes, dislikes, common sense, I don't care, blow it all away, BAN!!!

486
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:49,256
好き嫌い常識 I don't care 吹っ飛べ BAN!!!
Likes, dislikes, common sense, I don't care, blow it all away, BAN!!!

487
00:39:50,356 --> 00:39:53,556
振る舞うならさ このリリック回さ
If I'm going to act, I'll turn these lyrics

488
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:57,256
わからす 挑発 下向いて舌打ちからの はっ？
I'll make you understand, provocation, looking down, clicking my tongue, and then, 'huh?'

489
00:39:57,556 --> 00:39:59,056
Excuse me?

490
00:40:00,092 --> 00:40:01,392
言い返して頂戴
Tell me back

491
00:40:01,392 --> 00:40:03,992
パンチライン　聞かせてあげる ah
I'll let you hear the punchline, ah

492
00:40:03,992 --> 00:40:06,592
やってから考えな
Think about it after you do it

493
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:10,592
私が見つめてるから ah
Because I'm looking at you, ah

494
00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:13,392
Everybody say I wanna be free

495
00:40:13,392 --> 00:40:20,192
研ぎ澄ます　五感全部黙らす ah
Hone all five senses and shut them up, ah

496
00:40:20,192 --> 00:40:21,892
目覚ませ起きろ
Wake up, get up

497
00:40:21,892 --> 00:40:23,592
Wake up wake up

498
00:40:23,592 --> 00:40:26,592
いっとけなら今だ
Go for it, it's now

499
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:30,592
ねえいっとけなら今だ
Hey, go for it, it's now

500
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:41,292
生まれたその時から選んできたんだ
I've been choosing since the moment I was born

501
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:44,892
思い出せ　私は私だ
Remember, I am who I am

502
00:40:44,892 --> 00:40:51,592
不可能なことなど何ひとつもないさじゃないの
There's nothing impossible, isn't that right?

503
00:40:51,592 --> 00:40:55,392
生まれたその時から選んできたんだ
I've been choosing since the moment I was born

504
00:40:55,392 --> 00:40:58,892
思い出せ　あなたはあなただ
Remember, you are who you are

505
00:40:58,892 --> 00:41:04,592
不可能なことなど何ひとつもないさじゃないの
There's nothing impossible, isn't that right?

506
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:06,592
なりたい自分に
To the person you want to be

507
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:13,592
好き嫌い　正しい I don't care フットペダル
Like, dislike, correct, I don't care, foot pedal

508
00:41:15,592 --> 00:41:21,092
好き嫌い　正しい I don't care フットペダル
Like, dislike, correct, I don't care, foot pedal

509
00:42:37,092 --> 00:42:40,125
Bad Apple!!

510
00:42:49,092 --> 00:42:53,092
流れてく時の中ででも　けだるさが
Even in the flowing time, listlessness

511
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:57,092
ほらグルグル回って　私から離れる
Look, it goes around and around, leaving me

512
00:42:57,092 --> 00:43:00,092
心も見えないわ　そう知らない
I can't even see my heart, I don't know

513
00:43:00,092 --> 00:43:04,092
自分から動くこともなく　時の隙間に
Without moving on my own, in the gaps of time

514
00:43:04,092 --> 00:43:10,092
流され続けて　知らないわ　周りのことなど
Kept being swept away, I don't know about my surroundings

515
00:43:10,092 --> 00:43:14,092
私は私　それだけ
I am me, that's all

516
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:18,092
夢見てる　なにも見てない　語るも無駄な
I'm dreaming, seeing nothing, it's useless to talk

517
00:43:18,092 --> 00:43:23,092
自分の言葉　悲しむなんて　疲れるだけよ
My own words, grieving only makes me tired

518
00:43:23,092 --> 00:43:27,092
なにも感じず過ごせばいいの
I should just spend my time without feeling anything

519
00:43:27,092 --> 00:43:32,092
戸惑う言葉　与えられても　自分の心
Even if given confusing words, my own heart

520
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:37,092
ただ上の空　もし私から　動くのならば
Is just absent-minded, if I were to move

521
00:43:37,092 --> 00:43:41,092
すべて変えるのなら　黒にするわ
If I were to change everything, I'd make it black

522
00:43:41,092 --> 00:43:46,092
こんな自分に　未来はあるの？　こんな世界に
Is there a future for a self like this? In such a world

523
00:43:46,092 --> 00:43:50,092
私はいるの？　今切ないの？　今悲しいの？
Do I exist? Am I pained now? Am I sad now?

524
00:43:50,092 --> 00:43:55,092
自分のことも　わからないまま
Without even knowing myself

525
00:43:55,092 --> 00:44:00,092
歩むことさえ　疲れるだけよ　人のことなど
Even walking only makes me tired, as for others

526
00:44:00,092 --> 00:44:05,092
知りもしないわ　こんな私も　変われるのなら
I don't even know them, if even I could change

527
00:44:05,092 --> 00:44:11,092
もし変われるのなら　白になるわ
If I could change, I'd become white

528
00:44:26,092 --> 00:44:30,092
流れてく時の中ででも　けだるさが
Even in the flowing time, listlessness

529
00:44:30,092 --> 00:44:34,092
ほらグルグル回って　私から離れる
Look, it goes around and around, leaving me

530
00:44:34,092 --> 00:44:38,092
心も見えないわ　そう知らない
I can't even see my heart, I don't know

531
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:42,092
自分から動くこともなく　時の隙間に
Without moving on my own, in the gaps of time

532
00:44:42,092 --> 00:44:48,092
流され続けて　知らないわ　周りのことなど
Kept being swept away, I don't know about my surroundings

533
00:44:48,092 --> 00:44:52,092
私は私　それだけ
I am me, that's all

534
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:56,092
夢見てる　なにも見てない　語るも無駄な
I'm dreaming, seeing nothing, it's useless to talk

535
00:44:56,092 --> 00:45:01,092
自分の言葉　悲しむなんて　疲れるだけよ
My own words, grieving only makes me tired

536
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:06,380
逃げよう
Let's run away

537
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,730
何も感じず過ごせばいいの
I should just spend my time feeling nothing

538
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,430
戸惑う言葉与えられても
Even if I'm given confusing words

539
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,830
自分の心
My heart is

540
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,130
ただ上の空
just somewhere else

541
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,180
もし私から動くのならば
If I were to move on my own

542
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:22,280
すべて変えるのなら黒にする
If I were to change everything, I'd make it black

543
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,580
動くのならば
If I move

544
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,580
動くのならば
If I move

545
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,580
すべて壊すわ
I'll break everything

546
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,580
すべて壊すわ
I'll break everything

547
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,180
悲しむならば
If you're sad

548
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,180
悲しむならば
If you're sad

549
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,230
私の心白く変われる？
Can my heart change to white?

550
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:40,480
あなたのことも私のことも
Both you and me

551
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,230
すべてのこともまだ知らないの
I still don't know anything about it

552
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,230
重いまぶたを開けたのならば
If I open my heavy eyelids

553
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:50,380
すべて壊すのなら黒になれ
If I destroy everything, then let it turn to black

554
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:36,080
Yeah...

556
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,580
いつか君が瞳に灯す愛の光が
The light of love that you will one day light in your eyes

557
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,080
時を越えて
transcending time

558
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:59,680
滅び急ぐ世界の夢を確かに一つ
will surely break one of the dreams

559
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,680
壊すだろう
of a world rushing to its demise

560
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,080
ためらいを飲み干して
Drink up your hesitation

561
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,080
君が望むものは何？
What is it that you desire?

562
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,580
こんな欲深い憧れの行方に
In the outcome of such greedy longings

563
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:18,080
はかない明日はあるの？
is there a fleeting tomorrow?

564
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,580
子供の頃夢に見てた
Like the ancient magic

565
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:27,080
古の魔法のように
I saw in my dreams as a child

566
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,580
闇さえ砕く力で
with a power that can even crush the darkness

567
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:34,380
微笑む君に会いたい
I want to meet you smiling

568
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:39,080
怯えるこの手の中には
In these trembling hands

569
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,580
手折られた花と勇気
are a plucked flower and courage

570
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:45,580
思いだけが頼るすべて
My feelings are all I have to rely on

571
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:51,080
光を呼び覚ます願い
a wish to awaken the light

572
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,580
いつか君も誰かのために強い力を
One day, you too will desire

573
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,080
望むのだろう
a strong power for someone else's sake

574
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,580
愛が胸を捕らえた夜に
On the night when love captured your heart

575
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:15,080
未知の言葉が生まれてくる
unknown words come to life

576
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,580
迷わずに行けるなら
If you can go without hesitation

577
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,580
心が砕けてもいいわ
it's okay if my heart shatters

578
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:26,080
いつも目前の悲しみに
To always face

579
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,380
立ち向かうための呪文が欲しい
the sorrow right before my eyes, I want a spell

580
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,580
君はまだ夢見る記憶
You are still a dreaming memory

581
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:39,580
私は眠らない明日
I am a sleepless tomorrow

582
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:43,580
二人が出会う奇跡を勝ち取るために
To win the miracle of the two of us meeting

583
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:47,580
進むわ
I will move forward

584
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,380
怯えるこの手の中には
In these trembling hands

585
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,880
手折られた花と刃
are a plucked flower and a blade

586
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,380
思いだけが生きるすべて
My feelings are all that keeps me alive

587
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:03,380
心に振りかざす願い
a wish to brandish in my heart

588
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:08,616
とらわれた太陽の輝く
The radiance of the captive sun

589
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:17,116
不思議の国の本が好きだった頃
Back when I loved books about wonderland

590
00:50:20,116 --> 00:50:23,816
願いはきっと叶うと教える
I believed in fairy tales

591
00:50:23,816 --> 00:50:27,616
おとぎ話を信じた
that taught me wishes surely come true

592
00:50:28,116 --> 00:50:34,616
光と影の中
Amidst light and shadow

593
00:50:42,616 --> 00:50:46,616
静かに咲き乱れていた
Gently, the ancient magic

594
00:50:46,616 --> 00:50:50,116
古の魔法を優しく
that was blooming in silence...

595
00:50:50,616 --> 00:50:54,116
世界を変える力が
...whispers that the power

596
00:50:54,116 --> 00:50:58,116
その手にあると囁く
to change the world is in those hands.

597
00:50:58,616 --> 00:51:02,116
終わらない夢を見よう
Let's dream an endless dream

598
00:51:02,116 --> 00:51:06,116
君と行く時の中で
within the time I spend with you.

599
00:51:06,616 --> 00:51:10,116
想いだけが生きる全て
These feelings are all that live;

600
00:51:10,116 --> 00:51:14,116
命を作るのは願い
what creates life is a wish.

601
00:51:44,616 --> 00:51:49,116
うわあああー！イェーイ！
Waaaah! Yay!

602
00:51:50,116 --> 00:51:53,916
アキちゃん、お誕生日おめでとう！
Aki-chan, happy birthday!

603
00:51:54,116 --> 00:51:58,616
ありがとうー！イェーイ！
Thank you! Yay!

604
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,116
いやー、今日は来てくれてありがとうございます。
Man, thank you for coming today.

605
00:52:01,316 --> 00:52:06,116
いえいえ、こちらこそですよ。呼んでくれてありがとう。
No, thank you as well. Thanks for inviting us.

606
00:52:06,616 --> 00:52:09,616
実はね、二人を呼んだのにはちょっと理由があって。
Actually, there's a reason I invited you two.

607
00:52:10,116 --> 00:52:12,116
お、なんだなんだ？
Oh? What's that?

608
00:52:12,616 --> 00:52:15,616
前に、アキロゼの4周年の時に、
Previously, for AkiRose's 4th anniversary,

609
00:52:15,616 --> 00:52:18,616
3人でKalafinaさんの曲歌わせてもらったんだけど。
the three of us sang a Kalafina song.

610
00:52:19,116 --> 00:52:22,116
やりましたねー！めっちゃ良かったやつね！
We did! That was a really great one!

611
00:52:22,616 --> 00:52:25,116
ハーモニーがね、そう。
The harmony, yeah.

612
00:52:25,616 --> 00:52:28,616
もうね、ミオちゃんの歌も大好きだし、
I love Mio-chan's singing,

613
00:52:28,616 --> 00:52:32,116
あずあずの歌も大好きだし、もうそのね、忘れられないの。
and I love Azu-azu's singing too. I just can't forget it.

614
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:35,116
忘れない。わかる、めっちゃわかる。
Won't forget. I know, I totally get it.

615
00:52:35,616 --> 00:52:38,616
そう。だからもう一回、
Exactly. So I wanted to sing with the three of us

616
00:52:38,616 --> 00:52:42,116
このライブステージで3人で歌いたくて、今日は来てもらいました。
on a live stage again, which is why I asked you to come.

617
00:52:42,616 --> 00:52:46,616
嬉しい！ありがとうありがとう！
I'm so happy! Thank you, thank you!

618
00:52:47,116 --> 00:52:51,116
そう、だからこれからね、これを機に、もっと3人で歌ったりとか、
So, taking this opportunity, I'd be so happy if we could

619
00:52:51,116 --> 00:52:55,116
なんかそういうの挑戦できたらめっちゃ嬉しい。
try singing more together as a trio.

620
00:52:55,616 --> 00:52:58,116
いいですね！ハーモニーを重ねていきましょうよ。
Let's do it! Let's keep layering our harmonies.

621
00:52:58,616 --> 00:53:01,616
え、いいの！？嬉しいー！
Really? Yay! I'm so happy!

622
00:53:02,116 --> 00:53:05,116
なんかユニット名とか欲しいなー。
I want a unit name or something.

623
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:07,116
確かに、なんだろう。
True, what should it be?

624
00:53:07,616 --> 00:53:10,116
え、なんかちょっと世界目指せるぐらいの。
Like, something where we can aim for the world.

625
00:53:10,616 --> 00:53:11,616
世界！？
The world!?

626
00:53:12,116 --> 00:53:15,616
世界の、世界のコンサートしようよ。
Let's do a world concert.

627
00:53:16,116 --> 00:53:20,116
世界に驚く、我ら何かをね、したいということで。
Let's do something that will surprise the world.

628
00:53:21,116 --> 00:53:23,116
この3人でライブとか、アコースティックとか、
With us three, like an acoustic live

629
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,616
オーケストラライブとか。
or an orchestral live...

630
00:53:26,116 --> 00:53:29,116
うわー、良くないですか？そういうことをしてみたい。
Wow, wouldn't that be nice? I want to try that.

631
00:53:29,116 --> 00:53:33,116
我らならできるかもしれない！おねがいします！
We might be able to do it! Please!

632
00:53:36,616 --> 00:53:40,116
あれ？え？これは一体何ですか？
Huh? What's this?

633
00:53:42,116 --> 00:53:45,116
もしかして、このライブでみんなからの、
Could it be, with the power from everyone

634
00:53:45,116 --> 00:53:48,616
なんかいいパワーで。
at this live...

635
00:53:49,116 --> 00:53:50,116
なんかいいパワー来てる！
Some good power is coming!

636
00:53:50,616 --> 00:53:52,116
演出だ、それ。
That's visual effects.

637
00:53:52,616 --> 00:53:54,116
なんだよ、そのパワー。
What is that power?

638
00:53:54,616 --> 00:53:59,116
こちらがなんと、完成しました！
This has finally been completed!

639
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:03,116
実は、この後。
Actually, after this...

640
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:06,116
アキロゼの新曲が出ます！
AkiRose's new song will be released!

641
00:54:06,616 --> 00:54:11,116
出たー！やったー！
It's out! Yay!

642
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:15,616
こちら、ま、今回のあのライブのま、テーマというか、
This song is themed after the grand theme

643
00:54:15,616 --> 00:54:18,616
壮大なテーマがあるんですけど。
of this live performance.

644
00:54:19,116 --> 00:54:24,116
そちらも詰まったような楽曲になっています。
It's a track packed with all that.

645
00:54:24,616 --> 00:54:27,616
そしてライブ終わりの日付が変わる時に、
It will be released at midnight after the live,

646
00:54:27,616 --> 00:54:29,616
リリースしますので、ぜひ買って聴いてください。

647
00:54:30,616 --> 00:54:34,116
イェーイ！みんな聴くぞー！
Yay! Everyone, let's listen!

648
00:54:35,616 --> 00:54:38,616
ではでは、じゃあ次の曲に行きますか。
Now then, shall we move on to the next song?

649
00:54:39,116 --> 00:54:40,616
次の曲。
Next song.

650
00:54:41,116 --> 00:54:42,116
新曲お披露目。
Performing the new song.

651
00:54:42,616 --> 00:54:44,116
なんだって！？
What!?

652
00:54:44,616 --> 00:54:46,616
しちゃいます！
I'm going to do it!

653
00:54:47,116 --> 00:54:50,116
今からってこと！？今から。
You mean right now!? Right now.

654
00:54:50,616 --> 00:54:53,116
頑張ります！もう最後まで見逃せないですね。
I'll do my best! Don't miss it until the very end.

655
00:54:53,616 --> 00:54:55,116
楽しみだー。アキちゃん頑張ってね！
I can't wait. Good luck, Aki-chan!

656
00:54:55,616 --> 00:55:00,116
ありがとうー！またねー！
Thank you! See you later!

657
00:55:05,104 --> 00:55:08,504
モノポリー
作詞・作曲・編曲：なるみや
Monopoly
Lyrics, Composition, Arrangement: Narumiya

658
00:55:08,504 --> 00:55:10,204
魅惑の言葉の
Captivating words

659
00:55:10,204 --> 00:55:14,204
裏面に忍ばせた
Hidden on the reverse side

660
00:55:14,204 --> 00:55:17,504
1mg(ミリグラム)のスパイス
A milligram of spice

661
00:55:17,504 --> 00:55:19,004
たちまち華麗な
Instantly magnificent

662
00:55:19,004 --> 00:55:22,904
指先で彩る
Colored with fingertips

663
00:55:22,904 --> 00:55:25,604
本日のダイス
Today's dice

664
00:55:25,604 --> 00:55:28,804
当たり前見てた景色じゃ
In the scenery I took for granted

665
00:55:28,804 --> 00:55:32,804
生き残れないでしょう
You probably won't survive

666
00:55:32,804 --> 00:55:34,904
率直に言って
To be frank

667
00:55:34,904 --> 00:55:37,104
全てが欲しい
I want it all

668
00:55:37,104 --> 00:55:40,804
一人勝ちオールイン
Winner-takes-all, All-in

669
00:55:42,904 --> 00:55:45,004
どうなっちゃってもいいじゃない
It doesn't matter what happens

670
00:55:45,004 --> 00:55:46,904
際限なんてないじゃない
There are no limits, right?

671
00:55:46,904 --> 00:55:48,804
翻弄して 翻弄されて
Trifling, and being trifled with

672
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,704
ゾクゾク
Thrillingly

673
00:55:50,704 --> 00:55:52,704
喰らっちゃっても本望でしょ
It's what you wanted, even if you get eaten, right?

674
00:55:52,704 --> 00:55:54,304
最低だって滾るでしょ
Even if it's the worst, you're excited, right?

675
00:55:54,304 --> 00:55:56,404
見透かして 見透かされて
Overlooking, and being overlooked

676
00:55:56,404 --> 00:55:58,504
永遠に終わりはない
There's no end to eternity

677
00:55:58,504 --> 00:56:02,204
高鳴るこの全てノンフィクション
Everything that's throbbing is non-fiction

678
00:56:17,704 --> 00:56:22,604
嗜むはずでもたまには飲み過ぎて
Even if I only meant to enjoy a little, sometimes I drink too much

679
00:56:22,604 --> 00:56:24,904
1回休み
Skip one turn

680
00:56:25,604 --> 00:56:30,604
周りもざわつく思わぬうたた寝で
Everyone around me is buzzing from my unexpected nap

681
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:32,804
2回休み
Skip two turns

682
00:56:33,504 --> 00:56:36,804
切れる頭と勘だけじゃ
Just with a sharp mind and intuition

683
00:56:36,804 --> 00:56:40,904
手に入らないモノ
Some things can't be obtained

684
00:56:40,904 --> 00:56:44,004
そこでいて見越されるならいい
It's fine if I'm being anticipated there

685
00:56:44,004 --> 00:56:49,304
命懸けで楽しむわ
I'll enjoy it with my life on the line

686
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,404
天と地は案外近くない
Heaven and earth aren't as close as you'd think

687
00:56:58,404 --> 00:56:59,904
この通り 命乞い
Just like this, begging for life

688
00:56:59,904 --> 00:57:01,604
たかがモノポリー されど大勝負
It's just Monopoly, but it's a big match

689
00:57:01,604 --> 00:57:04,104
決める思い 今宵は私が強い
Determined feelings, tonight I am strong

690
00:57:07,904 --> 00:57:10,004
どうなっちゃってもいいじゃない
It doesn't matter what happens

691
00:57:10,004 --> 00:57:12,004
際限なんてないじゃない
There are no limits, right?

692
00:57:12,004 --> 00:57:13,904
翻弄して 翻弄されて
Trifling, and being trifled with

693
00:57:13,904 --> 00:57:15,804
ゾクゾク
Thrillingly

694
00:57:15,804 --> 00:57:17,804
喰らっちゃっても本望でしょ
It's what you wanted, even if you get eaten, right?

695
00:57:17,804 --> 00:57:19,404
最低だって滾るでしょ
Even if it's the worst, you're excited, right?

696
00:57:19,404 --> 00:57:21,504
見透かして 見透かされて
Overlooking, and being overlooked

697
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,604
永遠に終わりはない
There's no end to eternity

698
00:57:23,604 --> 00:57:27,304
高鳴るこの全てノンフィクション
Everything that's throbbing is non-fiction

699
00:57:27,304 --> 00:57:30,904
堕ちても昇ってもノンフィクション
Whether falling or rising, it's non-fiction

700
00:57:57,104 --> 00:58:00,104
葛飾ラプソディー
作詞：森雪之丞 作曲：堂島孝平
Katsushika Rhapsody
Lyrics: Mori Yumino, Composition: Dojima Kohei

701
00:58:04,104 --> 00:58:07,104
中川に浮かぶ
Floating in the Nakagawa River

702
00:58:07,104 --> 00:58:11,104
夕日をめがけて
Aiming for the setting sun

703
00:58:11,104 --> 00:58:15,104
小石を蹴ったら
If I kick a small stone

704
00:58:15,104 --> 00:58:18,604
靴まで飛んで
Even my shoe flies away

705
00:58:18,604 --> 00:58:22,104
ジョギングしていた
The person who was jogging,

706
00:58:22,104 --> 00:58:25,604
大工の頭に
the carpenter foreman

707
00:58:25,604 --> 00:58:29,104
ガキのままだと
He laughed and said

708
00:58:29,104 --> 00:58:32,604
笑われたのさ
I'm still just a brat

709
00:58:32,604 --> 00:58:36,104
どこかに元気を
Even if I dropped my energy

710
00:58:36,104 --> 00:58:39,604
落としてきても
somewhere

711
00:58:39,604 --> 00:58:43,304
葛飾亀有
Katsushika, Kameari

712
00:58:43,304 --> 00:58:46,604
あくびをひとつ
I let out a yawn

713
00:58:46,604 --> 00:58:50,404
変わらない街並みが
The unchanging townscape

714
00:58:50,404 --> 00:58:53,604
妙に優しいよ
is strangely kind

715
00:58:47,604 --> 00:58:51,104
中央広場で
At the central square

716
00:58:51,104 --> 00:58:54,104
子供の手を引く
leading a child by the hand

717
00:58:54,104 --> 00:58:58,104
ふと見たあの子は
that child I suddenly saw

718
00:58:58,104 --> 00:59:01,604
懐かしい人
is someone I remember

719
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:05,104
ガムパッチンいけて
With a gum-snap prank

720
00:59:05,104 --> 00:59:08,604
渡しそびれた
that I missed the chance to give

721
00:59:08,604 --> 00:59:12,604
今も持ってるよと
'I still have it now', I said

722
00:59:12,604 --> 00:59:16,104
からかわれたよ
and was teased

723
00:59:16,104 --> 00:59:19,104
何にもいいこと
Even if nothing good

724
00:59:19,104 --> 00:59:22,604
なかったけれど
ever happened

725
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:26,104
葛飾水元
Katsushika, Mizumoto

726
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:29,604
流れる雲と
With the floating clouds

727
00:59:29,604 --> 00:59:33,104
ラプソディー口ずさみ
humming a rhapsody

728
00:59:33,104 --> 00:59:36,104
少し歩こうか
shall we walk a little?

729
00:59:32,104 --> 00:59:35,604
カラスが鳴くから
Since the crows are cawing

730
00:59:35,604 --> 00:59:39,604
もう日が暮れるね
the sun is already setting

731
00:59:39,604 --> 00:59:43,104
焼鳥ほおばり
Stuffing our cheeks with yakitori

732
00:59:43,104 --> 00:59:46,604
ビール飲もうか
shall we drink beer?

733
00:59:46,604 --> 00:59:50,104
トンボ釣り落とした
Many treasures from dragonfly fishing

734
00:59:50,104 --> 00:59:53,604
数多の宝
dropped away

735
00:59:53,604 --> 00:59:56,604
水元公園へと
Over Mizumoto Park,

736
00:59:56,604 --> 00:59:59,404
夕日が落ちる
the setting sun goes down

737
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:06,990
明日もこうして終わるんだね
Tomorrow will end like this too, won't it?

738
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:10,640
隠し事はまた幸せだって
Secrets are a form of happiness too.

739
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,540
隠して気がついた
I realized by hiding it...

740
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,990
馬鹿な本音だったから
...because it was a foolish true feeling.

741
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:20,640
どこかに未練を落としても
Even if I leave some regret somewhere,

742
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:24,190
隠しきれないあくびをひとつ
I let out a single yawn I couldn't hide.

743
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:27,590
変わらない街並みが
The unchanging cityscape is...

744
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:31,090
妙に優しいよ
...strangely kind.

2つ目のグッズが、運命の5枚 タロット風アクリルスタンドセット！
The second item is the "5 Cards of Fate"

At the start of your day, or when you want
to entrust something to fate...

使って楽しむ、そして5枚バーンって飾っておけるので、見ても楽しめるようになっております。
...you can use them to enjoy, and since you can display all five,
they're also great to look at.

01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:27,590
占い方法は、この後紹介するアキロゼのASMRボイスと連動しております。
The fortune-telling method is linked with the

01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:48,990
こちら、実際に遊んでいただけるトランプなので、たくさん予備も買ったほうがいいんじゃないかなと思います。
These are actual playing cards you can use, so I think
it might be a good idea to buy plenty of spares.
