00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:13,556
このコインは...
This coin is...

462
00:35:15,556 --> 00:35:16,856
はぁ...そうか。
Hah... I see.

463
00:35:16,856 --> 00:35:18,656
君はそっちなんだね。
So you're on that side.

464
00:35:20,156 --> 00:35:21,156
そっち？
That side?

465
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:23,856
ここに座って。
Sit here.

466
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:25,656
え？
Eh?

467
00:35:27,156 --> 00:35:28,856
この後は...
What happens next...

468
00:35:28,856 --> 00:35:30,556
君次第だよ。
is up to you.

469
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:15,856
忘れられないのはこの目のせい
It's this eye's fault I can't forget

470
00:36:15,856 --> 00:36:19,356
赤く残る過ち 甘噛みの跡
The mistake remains red, a trace of a playful bite

471
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:23,556
溢れ出す愛は止め処もない
The overflowing love is endless

472
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:27,256
誰もいない間に悪魔を探そう
Let's look for the devil while no one is here

473
00:36:28,556 --> 00:36:32,056
作り笑いはこの耳のせい
The fake smile is this ear's fault

474
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:35,856
深い壁の中から呼びかける声
A voice calling out from within the deep walls

475
00:36:36,756 --> 00:36:40,356
Whisper Whisper Whisper まだ触らせない
Whisper Whisper Whisper, I won't let you touch yet

476
00:36:40,356 --> 00:36:43,956
この檻を抜け出して悪魔は賭ける
Escaping this cage, the devil makes a bet

477
00:36:44,656 --> 00:36:48,056
鏡の前でこの口のせい
In front of the mirror, it's this mouth's fault

478
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:51,856
伝えたい言葉さえ噛み殺す夜
A night where I stifle even the words I want to say

479
00:36:52,856 --> 00:36:56,556
Whisper Whisper Whisper まだ打ち明けない
Whisper Whisper Whisper, I won't confess yet

480
00:36:56,556 --> 00:36:59,856
神様を裏切って悪魔と過ごす
Betraying God to spend time with the devil

481
00:37:00,756 --> 00:37:04,056
アイマイミー夢見ていたい貴方に
I, my, me, I want to keep dreaming of you

482
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:07,556
そっと気付かせてあげたいだけ
I just want to make you realize softly

483
00:37:08,256 --> 00:37:10,156

消えない傷を隠したい
I want to hide the indelible scars

487
00:37:19,356 --> 00:37:23,056
貴方にそっと悩ませてあげたいだけ
I just want to make you worry a little

488
00:37:24,456 --> 00:37:26,056
Oh 貴方にも
Oh, to you too

Oh 貴方にも
Oh, to you too

491
00:37:30,556 --> 00:37:32,556
悪魔を探す
I search for the devil

492
00:37:32,556 --> 00:37:36,056
作り笑いはこの耳のせい
The fake smile is this ear's fault

493
00:37:36,056 --> 00:37:39,856
深い壁の中から呼びかける声
A voice calling out from within the deep walls

494
00:37:40,856 --> 00:37:44,356
Whisper Whisper Whisper まだ触らせない
Whisper Whisper Whisper, I won't let you touch yet

495
00:37:44,356 --> 00:37:47,856
この檻を抜け出して悪魔は賭ける
Escaping this cage, the devil makes a bet

496
00:37:48,656 --> 00:37:52,056
鏡の前でこの口のせい
In front of the mirror, it's this mouth's fault

497
00:37:52,056 --> 00:37:55,956
伝えたい言葉さえ噛み殺す夜
A night where I stifle even the words I want to say

498
00:37:56,856 --> 00:38:00,356
Whisper Whisper Whisper まだ打ち明けない
Whisper Whisper Whisper, I won't confess yet

499
00:38:00,356 --> 00:38:03,856
神様を裏切って悪魔と過ごす
Betraying God to spend time with the devil

500
00:38:22,356 --> 00:38:26,056
好き嫌い常識 I don't care 吹き飛ばせば
Likes, dislikes, common sense, I don't care, just blow it away

501
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:29,556
かかってこい Majority アタシに負けはなし
Bring it on, Majority, I never lose

502
00:38:30,056 --> 00:38:33,156
ここまでって引かれたそのボーダー誰のルール？
Who's rule decided that border drawn up to here?

503
00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:37,056
あの日乗り越えた Weak heart
The weak heart I overcame that day

504
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,556
強くなったアタシが笑い飛ばすだけ
Now that I'm stronger, I just laugh it off

505
00:38:40,556 --> 00:38:42,056
言いたいことは言う
I say what I want to say

506
00:38:42,556 --> 00:38:44,556
やりたくないことはしない
I don't do what I don't want to do

507
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,556
悪意気にしない
I don't care about malice

508
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:49,256
みんな違うの当然だし
It's natural that everyone is different

509
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:52,556
アタシも変わらない譲れないの
I won't change either, I won't yield

510
00:38:52,556 --> 00:38:54,056
自分だけは
myself.

511
00:38:55,056 --> 00:38:57,556
Ready ready set I want to be free

512
00:38:57,556 --> 00:39:00,556
明日のことはもう言わない
I won't talk about tomorrow anymore

513
00:39:00,556 --> 00:39:02,856
それじゃ何も変えられない
That won't change anything

514
00:39:02,856 --> 00:39:05,056
Ready ready set I want to be strong

515
00:39:05,056 --> 00:39:08,056
守りたい自分肯定
I want to protect my self-affirmation

516
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:10,556
生きてるんだアタシ
I am living

517
00:39:13,556 --> 00:39:15,556
運命決めてるんだだし
Because I'm deciding my fate

518
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:25,556
声上げて生まれたバースから選んできたんだ
I've been choosing since the birth I cried out for

519
00:39:25,856 --> 00:39:29,056
思い出せ アタシはアタシだ 他の誰でもない
Remember, I am me, nobody else

520
00:39:29,556 --> 00:39:33,256
何一つもない 嘘じゃないない
There's nothing, it's not a lie

521
00:39:34,856 --> 00:39:36,556
大事なファンに
To my important fans

522
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:40,056
好き嫌い常識 I don't care 吹き飛ばせば
Likes, dislikes, common sense, I don't care, just blow it away

523
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:52,056
Filter 外して この lyric かまして
Take off the filter, drop this lyric

524
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,056
わからす挑発
A provocation to make you understand

525
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:56,056
下向いて舌打ちからの HA
Looking down, clicking my tongue, then HA

526
00:39:58,056 --> 00:39:59,556
Excuse me?

527
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:04,292
イカせてあげる Ah
I'll let you go, Ah.

528
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:07,192
やってきた感慨な
The deep emotion that has arrived.

529
00:40:07,192 --> 00:40:11,292
アタシがついてるから
Because I'm here with you.

530
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:14,692
Everybody say I want to be free

531
00:40:15,192 --> 00:40:20,892
この美徳習慣 全部黙らす Show
This virtuous custom, a show to silence it all.

532
00:40:21,392 --> 00:40:23,592
目覚ませ起きろ
Wake up, get up!

533
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:28,092
生きてるんだだし
Since I'm alive.

534
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:34,592
ねえ 生きてるんだだし
Hey, since I'm alive.

535
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:43,292
生まれたその時から選んできたんだ思い出せ
Remember, I chose this from the moment I was born.

536
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:45,892
アタシはアタシだ
I am me.

537
00:40:46,492 --> 00:40:52,592
不可能なことなど何一つもない そうじゃないの
There's nothing impossible, isn't that right?

538
00:40:53,092 --> 00:40:56,892
生まれたその時から選んできたんだ思い出せ
Remember, I chose this from the moment I was born.

539
00:40:56,892 --> 00:41:00,092
貴方は貴方だ
You are you.

540
00:41:00,092 --> 00:41:06,392
不可能なことなど何一つもない そうじゃないの
There's nothing impossible, isn't that right?

541
00:41:06,392 --> 00:41:09,592
愛いっぱい自分に
Full of love for myself.

542
00:41:10,192 --> 00:41:17,392
好き嫌い常識 I don't care ぶっ飛ばせ
Likes, dislikes, common sense, I don't care, blast them away!

543
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:22,092
Again 好き嫌い常識 I don't care ぶっ飛ばせ
Again, likes, dislikes, common sense, I don't care, blast them away!

544
00:42:50,092 --> 00:42:54,292
流れてく時の中ででも
Even within the flowing time,

545
00:42:54,292 --> 00:42:57,492
気だるさがほらグルグル廻って
look, the lethargy spins round and round.

546
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:01,892
私から離れる心も見えないわ
I can't even see my heart leaving me.

547
00:43:01,892 --> 00:43:03,992
そう知らない
I really don't know.

548
00:43:04,492 --> 00:43:07,992
自分から動くこともなく
Without moving on my own,

549
00:43:07,992 --> 00:43:11,792
時の隙間に流され続けて
I continue to be swept away in the gaps of time.

550
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:15,392
知らないわ周りのことなど
I don't know anything about what's around me.

551
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:18,492
私は私それだけ
I am me, that is all.

552
00:43:18,492 --> 00:43:20,992
夢見てる？なにも見てない？
Am I dreaming? Am I seeing nothing?

553
00:43:20,992 --> 00:43:24,792
語るも無駄な自分の言葉
My own words are useless to speak.

554
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:28,992
悲しむなんて疲れるだけよ
Being sad just makes me tired.

555
00:43:28,992 --> 00:43:32,492
何も感じず過ごせばいいの
It's fine if I spend time feeling nothing.

556
00:43:32,492 --> 00:43:35,892
戸惑う言葉与えられても
Even if given confusing words,

557
00:43:35,892 --> 00:43:39,292
自分の心ただ上の空
my heart is just absent-minded.

558
00:43:39,292 --> 00:43:42,592
もし私から動くのならば
If I were to move on my own,

559
00:43:42,592 --> 00:43:46,092
すべて変えるのなら黒にする
if I could change everything, I'd turn it black.

560
00:43:46,092 --> 00:43:49,392
こんな自分に未来はあるの？
Does such a self have a future?

561
00:43:49,392 --> 00:43:52,892
こんな世界に私はいるの？
Am I existing in such a world?

562
00:43:52,892 --> 00:43:56,292
今切ないの？今悲しいの？
Is it painful now? Is it sad now?

563
00:43:56,292 --> 00:43:59,792
自分の事もわからないまま
While not even understanding myself.

564
00:43:59,792 --> 00:44:03,192
歩むことさえ疲れるだけよ
Even walking just tires me out.

565
00:44:03,192 --> 00:44:06,692
人のことなど知りもしないわ
I don't know anything about others.

566
00:44:06,692 --> 00:44:09,992
こんな私も変われるのなら
If even I can change,

567
00:44:09,992 --> 00:44:13,392
もし変われるのなら白になる
if I can change, I'll become white.

568
00:44:27,992 --> 00:44:32,192
流れてく時の中ででも
Even within the flowing time,

569
00:44:32,192 --> 00:44:35,392
気だるさがほらグルグル廻って
look, the lethargy spins round and round.

570
00:44:35,392 --> 00:44:39,692
私から離れる心も見えないわ
I can't even see my heart leaving me.

571
00:44:39,692 --> 00:44:41,892
そう知らない
I really don't know.

572
00:44:42,392 --> 00:44:45,892
自分から動くこともなく
Without moving on my own,

573
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:49,692
時の隙間に流され続けて
I continue to be swept away in the gaps of time.

574
00:44:49,692 --> 00:44:53,192
知らないわ周りのことなど
I don't know anything about what's around me.

575
00:44:53,192 --> 00:44:56,292
私は私それだけ
I am me, that is all.

576
00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:58,792
夢見てる？なにも見てない？
Am I dreaming? Am I seeing nothing?

577
00:44:58,792 --> 00:45:01,392
語るも無駄な自分の言葉
My own words are useless to speak.

578
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,880
何もわからず過ごせばいいの
Is it fine to just live understanding nothing?

579
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,480
戸惑う言葉
Even if confusing words

580
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,480
与えられても
are given to me,

581
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,380
自分の心
my own heart

582
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,280
ただ上の空
is just absent-minded.

583
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,880
もし私から
If, from me,

584
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,980
動くのならば
I were to move,

585
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,880
すべて変えるのなら
if I were to change everything,

586
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,380
黒にする
I'll turn it black.

587
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,080
動くのならば
If I move,

588
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,880
動くのならば
if I move,

589
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,580
すべて壊すわ
I'll destroy everything.

590
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,380
すべて壊すわ
I'll destroy everything.

591
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,080
悲しむならば
If I grieve,

592
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,780
悲しむならば
if I grieve,

593
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,480
私の心
can my heart

594
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,480
白く変われる？
turn white?

595
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,280
あなたのことも
About you,

596
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,980
私のことも
about me,

597
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,680
すべてのことも
about everything,

598
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,480
まだ知らないの
I still don't know.

599
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,180
重い瞼を
If I opened

600
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,880
開けたのならば
my heavy eyelids,

601
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,880
すべて壊すのなら
if I am to destroy everything,

602
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,880
黒になれ
turn black!

603
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,180
いつか君が
Someday, the light of love

604
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,080
瞳に灯す
you light in your eyes

605
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,180
愛の光が
will cross time,

606
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,280
時を超えて
and surely destroy one thing

607
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,080
滅び急ぐ
in the world's dream

608
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,880
世界の夢を
that rushes towards ruin.

609
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,080
確かにひとつ
It will surely destroy one.

610
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,880
壊すだろう
It will destroy it.

611
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,380
躊躇いを
Swallow down

612
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:04,880
飲み干して
your hesitation.

613
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,880
君が望むものは何？
What is it that you wish for?

614
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,280
こんな欲深い
Is there a tomorrow

615
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,680
憧れの
at the destination

616
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,980
行方に
of such greedy aspiration,

617
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,380
儚い
so fleeting?

618
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,580
明日はあるの？
Is there a tomorrow?

619
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:23,080
子供の頃夢に見てた
Like the ancient magic I saw in dreams as a child,

620
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,580
古の魔法のように
like the ancient magic,

621
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,380
闇さえ砕く力で
with power to smash even the darkness,

622
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,080
微笑む君に会いたい
I want to meet the smiling you.

623
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:38,080
怯えるこの手の中には
Inside these frightened hands,

624
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,080
手折られた花の勇気
is the courage of a plucked flower.

625
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,880
想いだけが頼るすべて
Feelings are all I rely on.

626
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,280
光を呼び覚ます
Awakening the light,

627
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,580
願い
is my wish.

628
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,380
いつか君も
Someday, you too

629
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,380
誰かのために
will surely wish for strong power

630
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,580
強い力を
for someone's sake.

631
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,580
望むのだろう
You will surely wish for it.

632
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,380
愛が胸を
On the night love

633
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,380
捕らえた夜に
captured your heart,

634
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,380
未知の言葉が
unknown words

635
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,380
生まれて来る
are born.

636
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,780
迷わずに
If I can go

637
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,080
行けるなら
without hesitation,

638
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,880
心が砕けてもいいわ
it's fine if my heart breaks.

639
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,680
いつも目の前の
I want a spell

640
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,080
悲しみに
to confront the sadness

641
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,580
立ち向かうための
always before my eyes.

642
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,580
呪文が欲しい
I want a spell.

643
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:36,080
君はまだ夢見る記憶
You are still a dreaming memory.

644
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,080
私は眠らない明日
I am the sleepless tomorrow.

645
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,780
二人が出会う奇跡を
I will move forward to win

646
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,580
勝ち取るために進むわ
the miracle of us meeting.

647
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,380
怯えるこの手の中には
Inside these frightened hands,

648
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,380
手折られた花の刃
is the blade of a plucked flower.

649
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:59,280
想いだけが生きるすべて
Feelings are all that live.

650
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:02,880
心に振りかざす
Brandish in my heart,

651
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,080
願い
my wish.

652
00:50:04,016 --> 00:50:07,516
囚われた太陽の
Of the captive sun...

653
00:50:07,516 --> 00:50:09,716
輝く
...shining.

654
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:19,916
不思議の国の本が好きだった頃
When I loved books about Wonderland,

655
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:23,816
願いはきっと叶うと
that wishes would surely come true...

656
00:50:23,816 --> 00:50:28,116
教えるお伽噺を信じた
...I believed the fairy tales that taught me so.

657
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:32,116
光と影の中
In the light and shadow.

658
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:46,516
静かに咲き乱れていた
Quietly blooming in profusion,

659
00:50:46,516 --> 00:50:50,116
古の魔法を優しく
the ancient magic gently...

660
00:50:50,616 --> 00:50:54,716
世界を変える力が
...whispers that the power to change the world...

661
00:50:54,716 --> 00:50:58,416
その手にあると囁く
...is in your hands.

662
00:50:58,416 --> 00:51:02,116
終わらない夢を見よう
Let's dream an endless dream.

663
00:51:02,116 --> 00:51:06,016
君と行く時の中で
In the time I go with you,

664
00:51:06,016 --> 00:51:10,016
想いだけが生きる全て
feelings are everything that lives.

665
00:51:10,016 --> 00:51:13,916
命を作るのは
What creates life is...

666
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:16,616
願い
...a wish.

667
00:51:45,616 --> 00:51:48,116
ワーッ！
Waaah!

668
00:51:49,116 --> 00:51:50,616
アキちゃん！
Aki-chan!

669
00:51:51,016 --> 00:51:53,116
お誕生日おめでとう！
Happy Birthday!

670
00:51:53,116 --> 00:51:56,116
ありがとう！イェーイ！
Thank you! Yeaah!

671
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:01,416
今日は来てくれてありがとうございます。
Thank you for coming today.

672
00:52:02,116 --> 00:52:03,616
こちらこそですよ。
The pleasure is ours.

673
00:52:03,616 --> 00:52:05,616
呼んでくれてありがとう。
Thanks for inviting us.

674
00:52:06,116 --> 00:52:09,616
実はね、二人を呼んだのにちょっと理由があって。
Actually, there's a reason why I invited you two.

675
00:52:09,616 --> 00:52:11,116
お、なんだなんだ？
Oh, what is it?

676
00:52:11,316 --> 00:52:15,916
前に、アキロゼの4周年の時に3人で...
Before, at AkiRoze's 4th anniversary, the three of us...

677
00:52:16,316 --> 00:52:19,116
Kalafinaさんの曲、歌わせてもらったんだっけ。
...sang a Kalafina song together.

678
00:52:19,116 --> 00:52:20,216
やりましたね。
We did, didn't we.

679
00:52:20,216 --> 00:52:22,116
めっちゃ良かったやつね。
It was really good.

680
00:52:22,116 --> 00:52:24,116
ハーモニーがね。
The harmony, right?

681
00:52:25,616 --> 00:52:29,916
もうね、ミオちゃんの歌も大好きだし、AZKiちゃんの歌も大好きだし...
I just love Mio-chan's singing, and AZKi-chan's singing too...

682
00:52:30,116 --> 00:52:32,116
もうそこね、忘れられないの。
...and I can't forget that moment.

683
00:52:32,116 --> 00:52:33,616
わかる。
I get it.

684
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,116
忘れない。
I won't forget it.

685
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:35,616
めっちゃわかる？
You really get it?

686
00:52:36,116 --> 00:52:41,116
だからもう一回、このライブステージで、3人で歌いたくて...
So I wanted to sing with the three of us on this live stage one more time...

687
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,616
今日は来てもらいました！
...so I had you come today!

688
00:52:42,616 --> 00:52:45,116
嬉しい！ありがとう！
I'm happy! Thank you!

689
00:52:47,116 --> 00:52:49,916
だから、ま、これからは、これを機に...
So, well, taking this opportunity...

690
00:52:50,116 --> 00:52:53,116
もっと何か3人で歌ったりとか...
...to sing more with the three of us...

691
00:52:53,116 --> 00:52:56,116
何かそういうの挑戦できたらめっちゃ嬉しいなって。
...I'd be really happy if we could challenge things like that.

692
00:52:56,116 --> 00:52:57,116
いいですか？
Is it okay?

693
00:52:57,116 --> 00:52:58,616
ね、ハーモニーを重ねていきましょうよ。
Let's layer our harmonies together.

694
00:52:58,616 --> 00:53:00,116
えー、いいの！？
Eh, really!?

695
00:52:59,116 --> 00:53:00,616
嬉しい！
I'm so happy!

696
00:53:01,116 --> 00:53:04,116
何かユニット名とか欲しいな。
I kind of want a unit name or something.

697
00:53:04,116 --> 00:53:06,116
あ、確かに欲しいな。
Ah, I definitely want one.

698
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:07,616
えー、なんだろう？
Eh, what would it be?

699
00:53:07,616 --> 00:53:09,616
え、何かちょっと世界目指せるぐらいのさ...
Eh, something like, we could aim for the world...

700
00:53:09,116 --> 00:53:10,616
世界！？
The world!?

701
00:53:10,116 --> 00:53:11,616
ユニットにして...
...making it a unit...

702
00:53:11,616 --> 00:53:14,116
世界のコンサートをしようよ。
...let's do a world concert.

703
00:53:14,116 --> 00:53:15,616
やりたい！
I want to do it!

704
00:53:15,616 --> 00:53:17,116
世界に轟く...
Roaring to the world...

705
00:53:17,116 --> 00:53:20,116
何かをね、したいということで。
...doing something big, you mean.

706
00:53:20,116 --> 00:53:23,116
そう、3人でライブとか、なんかアコースティックとか...
Yes, a live with the three of us, or like an acoustic set...

707
00:53:24,116 --> 00:53:26,116
なんかオーケストラライブとか。
...or an orchestra live.

708
00:53:26,116 --> 00:53:27,616
え、よくないですか？
Eh, isn't that nice?

709
00:53:27,616 --> 00:53:29,116
そんなことをしてみたい。
I want to try doing things like that.

710
00:53:28,116 --> 00:53:30,116
ね、我らならできるかもしれない！
Hey, maybe we can do it!

711
00:53:30,116 --> 00:53:31,116
やったろう！
Let's do it!

712
00:53:31,116 --> 00:53:32,116
お願いします！
Please!

713
00:53:32,116 --> 00:53:33,616
ついていく！お願いします！
I'll follow! Please!

714
00:53:36,116 --> 00:53:40,116
あれ？これはいったい何ですか？
Huh? What on earth is this?

715
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,616
お？もしかして...
Oh? Could it be...

716
00:53:43,116 --> 00:53:45,916
このライブでみんなからの...
...from everyone at this live...

717
00:53:46,116 --> 00:53:48,116
なんかいいパワーで...
...some good power...

718
00:53:48,116 --> 00:53:51,116
なんかいいパワー！？なんか今来てる！？
Some good power!? Is something coming now!?

719
00:53:51,116 --> 00:53:52,616
いいのあるじゃんそれ。
That's a good one.

720
00:53:52,616 --> 00:53:54,116
なんだよそのパワー！
What is that power!

721
00:53:54,116 --> 00:53:57,116
こちらがなんと、完成しました！
This has, surprisingly, been completed!

722
00:53:57,116 --> 00:54:00,116
わーっ！なんだそれ！？
Waaah! What is that!?

723
00:54:00,116 --> 00:54:01,116
実は...
Actually...

724
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:02,616
この後...
After this...

725
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:05,116

AkiRoze's new song...

726

Will be released!

727
00:54:06,616 --> 00:54:09,116
わーっ！
Waaaah!

728
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:14,116
こちら、ま、今回の...
This, well, this time's...

729
00:54:14,116 --> 00:54:16,616
ライブの、ま、テーマというか...
...live's, well, theme or...

730
00:54:16,616 --> 00:54:19,116
壮大なテーマがあるんですけれども...
...there's a grand theme, but...

731
00:54:19,116 --> 00:54:22,616
そちらが詰まったような楽曲になっています。
...it has become a song packed with that.

732
00:54:24,116 --> 00:54:28,116
そして、ライブ終わりの日付が変わる時にリリースしますので...
And, it will be released when the date changes after the live ends, so...

733
00:54:28,116 --> 00:54:30,116
是非聴いてください！
...please definitely listen to it!

734
00:54:30,116 --> 00:54:33,116
いいね！みんな聴くぞ！
Nice! Everyone listen!

735
00:54:33,116 --> 00:54:34,116
はーい。
Ye-es.

736
00:54:35,616 --> 00:54:38,116
じゃあ次の曲に行きますか？
Then, shall we go to the next song?

737
00:54:38,116 --> 00:54:39,616
次の曲？
Next song?

738
00:54:39,616 --> 00:54:41,116
新曲のお披露目？
New song reveal?

739
00:54:41,116 --> 00:54:42,116
なんだって！？
What!?

740
00:54:42,116 --> 00:54:43,116
しちゃいます！
I'll do it!

741
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:45,116
わーっ！
Waaaah!

742
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:47,616
もう新曲のお披露目...え、今からってこと？
New song reveal already... eh, you mean right now?

743
00:54:47,616 --> 00:54:48,616
今から、頑張ります。
Right now, I'll do my best.

744
00:54:48,616 --> 00:54:50,616
もう最後まで見逃せないですね！
Can't miss it until the very end, huh!

745
00:54:51,116 --> 00:54:52,116
楽しみだ。
I'm looking forward to it.

746
00:54:52,116 --> 00:54:54,116
じゃあアキちゃん頑張ってね！
Then Aki-chan, good luck!

747
00:54:54,116 --> 00:54:56,116
ありがとう！またね！
Thank you! See you later!

748
00:54:56,116 --> 00:54:58,116
またねー！
See ya!

749
00:55:10,204 --> 00:55:14,604
魅惑の言葉の裏面に忍ばせた
Hidden on the flip side of those enchanting words,

750
00:55:14,604 --> 00:55:17,804
1mgのスパイス
Is 1mg of spice.

751
00:55:18,304 --> 00:55:22,904
たちまち華麗な指先で彩る
Instantly colored by brilliant fingertips,

752
00:55:23,504 --> 00:55:25,704
本日のダイス
Today's dice roll.

753
00:55:26,104 --> 00:55:28,804
当たり見てた興じてちゃ
If you're just amused watching for a win,

754
00:55:28,804 --> 00:55:31,604
生き残れないでしょう
You won't be able to survive, will you?

755
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:36,304
率直に言ってその全てが欲しい
To put it frankly, I want it all.

756
00:55:37,204 --> 00:55:40,004
一人勝ちにオールイン
Going all-in on a solo victory.

757
00:55:43,104 --> 00:55:45,104
どうなっちゃってもいいじゃない
It doesn't matter what happens, does it?

758
00:55:45,104 --> 00:55:47,104
際限なんてないじゃない
There are no limits, are there?

759
00:55:47,104 --> 00:55:49,304
翻弄して 翻弄されて
Trifling with you, being trifled with...

760
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,104
ゾクゾク
It's thrilling.

761
00:55:51,104 --> 00:55:53,104
喰らっちゃっても本望でしょう
Even if you take a hit, it's what you wanted, right?

762
00:55:53,104 --> 00:55:55,104
最低だって滾るでしょう
Even at the worst, it gets your blood boiling, doesn't it?

763
00:55:55,104 --> 00:55:57,004
見透かして 見透かされて
Seeing through me, being seen through...

764
00:55:57,004 --> 00:55:59,104
Yeah yeah 終わりはない
Yeah yeah, there is no end.

765
00:55:59,104 --> 00:56:01,904
高鳴るこの全てがノンフィクション
This heart-pounding everything is non-fiction.

766
00:56:18,104 --> 00:56:21,904
嗜むはずでも たまには飲みすぎて
I should only dabble, but sometimes I drink too much,

767
00:56:22,404 --> 00:56:24,504
一回休み
Skip one turn.

768
00:56:26,104 --> 00:56:30,104
周りもざわつく 思わぬうたた寝で
The room buzzes at my unexpected dozing off,

769
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:32,804
二回休み
Skip two turns.

770
00:56:34,104 --> 00:56:36,704
切れる頭と勘だけじゃ
With just a sharp mind and intuition,

771
00:56:37,104 --> 00:56:40,004
手に入らないもの
You can't get your hands on this.

00:58:28,804 --> 00:58:31,704
笑われたのさ
Saying I'm still just a brat.

797
00:58:32,204 --> 00:58:34,904
どこかに元気を
Even if I dropped my spirits

798
00:58:34,904 --> 00:58:37,004
落っことしても
Somewhere along the way,

799

私はフラれた
I got dumped.

808

When I said I still have feelings,

809

からかわれたよ
She just teased me.

810
00:59:15,204 --> 00:59:17,804

少し歩こうか
Shall we walk a little?

815
00:59:31,804 --> 00:59:35,004

Since the crows are cawing,

隠し事はまた 幸せだって
They say secrets are happiness too.

825
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:13,140
隠して気がついた
I realized it by hiding it,

826
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,940
馬鹿な本音だから
Because it's a foolish true feeling.

827
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,240
どこかに元気を落としても
Even if I drop my energy somewhere,

828
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,140
葛飾亀有
Katsushika Kameari,

829
