Every time I find a white flower

145
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,016
その姿を何度でも
Over and over again

146
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:31,016
また思い出す
I remember your figure

147
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:36,516
Forever glow

148
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:40,416
細い指先さえ
Even your slender fingertips

149
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:46,316
愛しくて想いが溢れた
Are so dear that my feelings overflowed

150
00:11:46,316 --> 00:11:53,016
声はもう、届かないけど、でも、
My voice no longer reaches you, but still,

151
00:11:53,016 --> 00:12:02,016
心の絆は切れないと信じた
I believed that the bond between our hearts wouldn't break

152
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:18,516
果て無く続く様な世界で
In a world that seems to go on forever

153
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:25,516
躓き途方に暮れて行く日々も
Even during days of stumbling and being at a loss

154
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:31,016
気付けば離れていたようで
It felt as if we had drifted apart

155
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:36,516
君と同じ道のりを
Along the same path as you

156
00:12:36,516 --> 00:12:40,016
きっと歩んでた
I'm sure I was walking

157
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:43,716
Forever glow

158
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:47,416
何故立ち止まったの？
Why did you stop?

159
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:53,016
悔しさが滲んでいた
Regret was seeping through

160
00:12:53,016 --> 00:13:01,016
声出すのまだ遅くないから
It's not too late to raise your voice

161
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:09,316
未来へ向かって諦めず走れと
Telling me to run toward the future without giving up

162
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:15,316
いつも胸に聞こえた
I always heard it in my heart

163
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:19,416
貴方の歌声
Your singing voice

164
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:26,516
憧れた強くて、でも、
I yearned for that strength, but,

165
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:31,416
触れたら消えてしまいそうな
As if it would disappear if I touched it

166
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:36,016
姿追い求めて
I went in search of that figure

167
00:13:45,316 --> 00:13:47,316
Forever glow

168
00:13:47,316 --> 00:13:51,316
細い指先さえ
Even your slender fingertips

169
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:57,316
愛しくて想いが溢れた
Are so dear that my feelings overflowed

170
00:13:57,316 --> 00:14:05,316
声はもう、届かないけど、でも、
My voice no longer reaches you, but still,

171
00:14:05,316 --> 00:14:12,316
いつしか運命が重なり合う
One day our fates will overlap

172
00:14:12,316 --> 00:14:21,016
心の絆は切れないと信じた
I believed that the bond between our hearts wouldn't break

173
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:56,516
夢は見るものじゃない 叶えるものだよ
Dreams aren't just something you see, they're something you make come true

174
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:59,016
輝きたい衝動に 素直でいよう
Let's be honest with the urge to shine

175
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,124
...なをでいよう
...stay true.

176
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:04,524
スタートライン！
Start line!

177
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:20,524
もし君が 立ち止まり 迷う日は
If you ever stop and feel lost,

178
00:15:20,824 --> 00:15:26,324
瞳とじて ココロの声を聞いて
Close your eyes and listen to your heart's voice.

179
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:32,424
「諦めない」 その言葉が 道になる
“I won't give up,” those words will become your path.

180
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:38,224
あの日の見た 景色目指して 進もう
Let's head toward the scenery we saw that day.

181
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:44,224
誰かの真似なんて 退屈なだけさ
Imitating someone else is just plain boring.

182
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:48,424
ひとりひとり 違うから奇跡
Because we're all different, it's a miracle.

183
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:51,524
一緒に飛ぼう
Let's fly together.

184
00:15:51,624 --> 00:15:57,124
夢は見るものじゃない 叶えるものだよ
Dreams aren't just for dreaming, they're for making them come true.

185
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:03,424
輝きたい衝動に 素直でいよう
Let's be true to the impulse to shine.

186
00:16:03,924 --> 00:16:09,124
後悔なんて絶対 君には似合わない
Regret absolutely doesn't suit you.

187
00:16:09,624 --> 00:16:15,324
限りない情熱で 飛び越えていこう
Let's leap over with boundless passion.

188
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:18,024
スタートライン！
Start line!

189
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:24,024
さあ 顔あげて
Come on, look up.

190
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:30,024
チャンスが待ってる！
A chance is waiting!

191
00:16:50,124 --> 00:16:52,524
微笑むペプラム
Smiling peplum

192
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:55,324
うっとり水玉
Enchanting polka dots

193
00:16:55,724 --> 00:17:00,124
見方を変えたらキュービック
If you change your perspective, it's cubic

194
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:05,424
新しい自分と 馴染みのアタシと
The new me and the familiar me

195
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:10,024
おしゃれのパレードは 行く
The fashion parade goes on

196
00:17:10,524 --> 00:17:13,024
fashion check go!

197
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:26,524
今日は姫カジかな？ (かな)
Is it hime-kaji today? (Maybe)

198
00:17:27,024 --> 00:17:31,524
カラーポップもいいな (いいな)
Color pop is also nice (Nice)

199
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:36,524
指に触れるカラフル イェイイェイ
Colorful touches on my fingers, yay yay

200
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:41,524
キュンとワクワクさせるんだ
It makes my heart throb and flutter

201
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:46,524
ピンクは夢見る自分に
Pink is for the dreaming me

202
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:51,524
ミドリはまっすぐな自分に
Green is for the straightforward me

203
00:17:52,524 --> 00:17:57,024
無限の遊び場にて
In the infinite playground

204
00:17:57,524 --> 00:18:02,024
万華鏡みたいに変われる
I can change like a kaleidoscope

205
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:04,524
(red, pink, blue, yellow!)

206
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:07,124
例えばcuteに
For example, cute

207
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:09,624
例えばsweetに
For example, sweet

208
00:18:09,724 --> 00:18:13,524
いつもと違う日曜日
A Sunday different from the usual

209
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:19,024
夢から覚めても おとぎの国へと
Even if I wake up from a dream, to a fairy tale land

210
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:24,324
おしゃれの旅は続く 続く
The fashion journey continues and continues

211
00:18:24,824 --> 00:18:26,024
(fashion check ful!)

212
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:14,524
つま先で立って 星に手を のばした1日
Standing on tiptoe, a day spent reaching for the stars

213
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:26,524
翼の毛布にくるまれて さぁ脚を休めて
Wrapped in a blanket of wings, now rest your legs

214
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:38,524
疲れているのなんて感じない しあわせで
I don't even feel tired because I'm so happy

215
00:19:39,424 --> 00:19:44,824
瞳は花のように 閉じずに咲いている
My eyes are like flowers, blooming without closing

216
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:51,324
眠らなきゃ それなのに なんか夢ばかり冴えて
I should sleep, and yet, dreams are just so vivid

217
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:56,824
そうね胸がおどるの
Yes, my heart is dancing

218
00:19:57,224 --> 00:19:59,824
明日への幕があく
The curtain rises for tomorrow

219
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,532
明日への幕があく
The curtain opens to tomorrow

220
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:04,032
（カーテン）
(Curtain)

221
00:20:04,132 --> 00:20:08,032
夜が明ける もうすぐ
The night is breaking, very soon

222
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:10,032
（時計塔）
(Clock Tower)

223
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:14,032
頑張るための休息
Rest to do your best

224
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:16,032
（それもひとつの準備）
(That's also a kind of preparation)

225
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:19,032
すごく大切なこと
A very important thing

226
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:22,532
頬にそっとキスする
Gently kissing your cheek

227
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:25,532
おやすみ チュチュ・バレリーナ
Good night, Chuchu Ballerina

228
00:20:51,532 --> 00:20:53,032
あ、こっちだよ。
Ah, over here.

229
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:56,532
あー！わー！
Ah! Wow!

230
00:20:57,032 --> 00:20:59,532
あらためて、あ、どうも、こちらに...
Once again, ah, hello, here we are...

231
00:21:11,032 --> 00:21:15,532
はい、素晴らしい方々に来ていただきましたー！

232
00:21:16,032 --> 00:21:20,032
みんな言わなきゃ！せーの！
Everyone say it! One, two!

233
00:21:20,532 --> 00:21:26,032
お誕生日おめでとうございまーす！
Happy Birthday!

234
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:31,532
ありがとうございます！やばい！ピチピチ清楚パワーにやられる...
Thank you so much! Oh my god! I'm being overwhelmed by this fresh, pure power...

235
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:37,032
ありがとうございます。ありがとうございます。どうも。はい。すごーい、可愛い！
Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Yes. So cute!

236
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:43,032
あ、こんなに可愛い子たちをね、絶対みんな知ってると思うんだけど...
Ah, these girls are so cute, I'm sure everyone knows them...

237
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:50,032
もしいたらあれだからちょっと、えっと、自己紹介なんざ、あ、わたくし尾丸ポルカと申します。
But just in case, let's have some self-introductions. Ah, I am Omaru Polka.

238
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:55,532
あ、よろしくお願いします！
Ah, nice to meet you!

239
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:59,032
ちょっとじゃあ自己紹介をしていただいてもいいでしょうか？
Could you please introduce yourselves?

240
00:21:59,532 --> 00:22:02,532
もちろんです！では、僭越ながらさせていただきます。
Of course! Well then, if I may.

241
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:05,532
親愛なる皆様へ、お元気ですか？
To my dear everyone, how are you?

242
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:11,032
みえる、みえる、スーパーアイドルになってる未来が見える！
I can see it, I can see it, I can see a future where I become a super idol!

243
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:13,532
姫乃みえるです。よろしくお願いします！

あくまでも羊じゃないよ。アイドルだよ。
I'm definitely not a sheep. I'm an idol.

246
00:22:23,032 --> 00:22:26,032
お願いします！
Please treat me well!

はい！パリパリパーン！
Yes! Pari-pari-pan!

248
00:22:32,032 --> 00:22:34,532
今日も生まれ変わっていくよ。アイドルの卵、
I'm going to be reborn again today. An idol egg,

249
00:22:34,532 --> 00:22:37,532
わー！パリンだよ！

250
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:41,032

はい！みんなと一緒にショータイム！
Yes! Show time with everyone!

252
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:51,032
いざ、きらめく瞬間を届けるアイドル、凛堂たいむだよ。
Now, I'm the idol who delivers sparkling moments, Rindou Taimu.

253
00:22:51,032 --> 00:22:54,032
お願いします！
Please treat me well!

254
00:23:02,532 --> 00:23:09,032
あらためまして、アイカツアカデミー配信部からようこそ。お願いします。お願いします。
Once again, welcome from the Aikatsu Academy Streaming Department. Please treat us well. Nice to meet you.

255
00:23:12,532 --> 00:23:14,532
えーと、メドレー歌いました。はい。
Uh, we sang a medley. Yes.

256
00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:18,032
えーと、わたくしが紹介していいんですか？
Uh, should I be the one introducing you?

257
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:22,032
はい！喜んで！そんな敬語...
Yes! Gladly! Such polite language...

258
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:28,532
えーと、まず『START DASH SENSATION』、そして『ファッションチェック！』、
Uh, first "START DASH SENSATION", then "Fashion Check!",

259
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:33,532
そして『チュチュ・バレリーナ』を歌わせていただきました。踊らせていただきました。
and then "Chuchu Ballerina". We sang and danced to them.

260
00:23:34,032 --> 00:23:40,032
慣れないわ、なんかすごい。可愛すぎて。オーラがさ、こっちからくるんにゃ。
I'm not used to this, it's amazing. They're too cute. The aura is coming from over here.

261
00:23:41,032 --> 00:23:44,532
まずあれだね、歌い分けとか一緒に考えたね。
First of all, we thought about the vocal distribution together, didn't we?

262
00:23:44,532 --> 00:23:51,032
そうなんです！みんなで考えた！楽しかったです、あれ！
That's right! We all thought about it together! That was fun!

263
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:56,532
なんか、なんか、なんとかの歌詞っぽいからそこは君！みたいな。
Like, "this sounds like so-and-so's lyrics, so you take that part!"

264
00:23:57,032 --> 00:24:03,032
一緒に歌うからここはこの誰々と誰々にしようよ、みたいな感じで話した気がする。
I think we talked about, "since we're singing together, let's have this person and that person do this part."

265
00:24:05,032 --> 00:24:10,032
気にして、気にして、あ、注目していただけたらなと思っております。
Please take note, ah, I hope you'll pay attention to it.

266
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:21,032
ねえ、すごかった。だから、なんかさ、感じたよ、すごい、アカデミーの素晴らしさをあらためて。
Hey, it was amazing. So, I felt it, the greatness of the Academy once again.

267
00:24:21,532 --> 00:24:24,532
可愛い。
So cute.

268
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:31,032
あの、これからもぜひね、よろしくお願いしたいと思っております。
I hope to continue working with you in the future.

269
00:24:36,532 --> 00:24:41,032
ステージでこうやって喋るだけでさ、あの、ポルカ満足しちゃってるからさ。
Just talking like this on stage, Polka is already satisfied.

270
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:47,032
なんか、壁になりたいなーって。床になって話し聞いてたいなーっていうぐらいなんなんだよ。
I want to be a wall. I want to be the floor and just listen to you talk, like, what is this?

271
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:49,532
だめー！みえるも床になっておきます。
No! Mieru will be the floor too.

272
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:52,532
だめー！自分は天井になる！
No! I'll be the ceiling!

273
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:55,532
じゃあ照明になろうかな。
Then maybe I'll be the lighting.

274
00:24:56,032 --> 00:24:59,032
空いてるの、空いてるの何？
What's left? What's left?

275
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,340
扉！扉！扉！
Door! Door! Door!

276
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,540
扉返し！扉返し！
Door return! Door return!

277
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,540
扉開けます。
I'm opening the door.

278
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,540
はい、扉開けるらしいです。
Right, apparently she's opening the door.

279
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,540
あのね、なんかさっきさ、マイクさ、持って練習してた時さ、なんかインタビューごっこ...
You know, earlier when we were practicing with the mics, we were playing like an interview...

280
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,540
あ〜見られてたんだ。やだ恥ずかしい。
Ah, you were watching. No, how embarrassing.

281
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,540
緊張ほぐすために。
To relieve the tension.

282
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,040
でもなんかあれ、誰だっけ？お腹すいた...
But who was it? "I'm hungry"...

283
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,540
アイたん？あ、オトたん。あ、水色の方。
Aito-tan? Ah, Oto-tan? Ah, the light blue one.

284
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,540
あ、やばい！やばい！
Ah, oh no! Oh no!

285
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,540
逃げろ！逃げろ！
Run away! Run away!

286
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,540
追われている。何に追われているの？
She's being chased. What's chasing her?

287
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,540
お腹すいた... 今日の気持ちはどうですか？

00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:47,040
やばいバレちゃった。あれ面白かった。
Oops, it got out. That was funny.

290
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,040
水色もお腹すいてますか？
Are you hungry too, Mizuiro?

291
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,040
お腹すいてる？お腹すいてる？お腹すいて... 空いてない！

You're full? Did you eat something?

294
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:03,040
あ、実は... あのなんか食べてなくて、お腹いっぱいすぎて...
Ah, actually... I haven't eaten, but I'm just too full...

295
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:09,540
こうして初めて5人で踊れて、嬉しさでお腹いっぱいです！
Being able to dance with the five of us like this, I'm full of happiness!

Oh! Yay!

297
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:18,540
そう、前は3人でセンターのさ、4人になってさ、ライムちゃんが来てさ...
Right, before it was three with the center, then it became four when Raimu-chan joined...

298
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:25,040
すごいなんかその時もポルカも「お〜！」って感じだったしさ。「ライムちゃん来てくれた〜」って思った...
It was amazing, Polka was like "Whoa!" then too. I thought "Raimu-chan is here!"...

299
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:30,040
これはあの一般的なね、リスナーの感想です。

一応ね、個々でも個人でも配信のチャンネルも持っておりますので、お名前とかでバシャバシャバシャって検索していただいたりとか...
We also each have our own personal streaming channels, so if you could search for our names and such...

306

あとXさんもやっておりますゆえ、そちらの方で今日配信あるよーとかもやっている感じでございますわよね。

532
00:44:24,564 --> 00:44:28,064

The illustration for this was drawn by Itono-sensei.

536
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:48,864
ちょっとね、いつもと違って、なんか尾丸ポルカもこれパンツスタイルなんでね。
It's a bit different from usual, and Omaru Polka is in a pants style here.

537
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:53,064
あの、どうですか？ちょっとスッキリ見えますか？
Um, how is it? Do I look a bit more sleek?

538
00:44:54,064 --> 00:44:59,064
あの、君をお迎えしてるっていう感じのシチュエーションになってるので、ぜひね、飾って...
Um, it's a situation where I'm welcoming you, so please, do display it...

539
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:00,772
「いらっしゃいませ、ようこそお客様!」
"Welcome, dear guest!"

540
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,372
続きとかも、
And with this piece,

541
00:45:01,372 --> 00:45:04,672
あ、ポルカ、ただいまじゃないけど、ホテル来たよーみたいな感じで
you can feel like, "Oh, Polka, I'm home!" or rather, "I've arrived at the hotel."

542
00:45:04,672 --> 00:45:06,672
見ていただければいいかなと思っております。
I hope you enjoy it that way.

一瞬にしてお部屋がホテルに...代わり...
In an instant, your room will... change... into a hotel.

なんと、いろんなポルカがいるね。
Wow, there are so many different Polkas!

551
00:45:32,472 --> 00:45:36,572
えっとホテルマンがコンセプトだったさっきのと続いて、
Following the hotel staff concept from earlier,

552
00:45:36,572 --> 00:45:41,072
ホテルの服着たやつと、メイドさんっぽいポルカと、お出かけのポルカと、
we have one in hotel attire, a maid-like Polka, an outing Polka, and...

553
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,072
あ、あいつは死んでんな。
Oh, that one looks exhausted.

554
00:45:43,072 --> 00:45:45,672
「もうだめ」みたいなポルカが入っております。
There's an "I'm done for" Polka in the mix.

555
00:45:45,672 --> 00:45:51,572
はい、えーとこの「もうだめ」みたいなポルカのTシャツがなんとグッズになっております。
And that "I'm done for" Polka is actually on a T-shirt that's also a merchandise item!

556
00:45:53,072 --> 00:45:55,072
3個目のグッズ、こちら!
The third item, here it is!

557
00:45:55,072 --> 00:45:56,572

558
00:45:56,572 --> 00:45:59,072
ポルカと一緒に低気圧と戦うTシャツ!
The T-shirt for fighting against low pressure with Polka!

559
00:45:59,072 --> 00:46:02,072
こちら、ポルカが描きました。はい。
I designed this one myself. Yes.

560
00:46:02,072 --> 00:46:07,072
あの、「低気圧おるか」ということでね、一緒にこれ着て低気圧と抗ったり、
With the pun "Is low pressure here?", wear this to resist the low pressure together,

561
00:46:07,072 --> 00:46:10,872
低気圧に負けたりしましょう。ポルカも着ます。
or just lose to it together. I'll be wearing it too!

562
00:46:10,872 --> 00:46:14,372
一緒に着られたらいいなって思ってます。
I'd be happy if we could wear it together.

563
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:17,872
というわけで、グッズもう一つ!じゃじゃん!
And so, one more item! Ta-da!

564
00:46:17,872 --> 00:46:19,372
ポルカの顔面ハンガー

565
00:46:19,372 --> 00:46:23,072
はい、ポルカの顔面ハンガー!
Yes, Polka's face hanger!

566
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:26,572
いやね、来ると思うんだよ、顔面ハンガーのブーム。
I really think a face hanger boom is coming.

567
00:46:26,572 --> 00:46:31,572
なんか、ポルカもさっきさ、スタジオでさ、こうやって衣装に着替えてる時にさ、
When I was changing into my costume in the studio earlier,

568
00:46:31,572 --> 00:46:34,072
もう置いちゃおうかなって思ったんだよね。
I thought about just putting it there.

569
00:46:34,072 --> 00:46:38,272
まあ良しとされるかわかんないけれども、みんなもやっぱポルカのこのTシャツも出したし、
I don't know if it's considered good, but since I released this T-shirt too,

570
00:46:38,272 --> 00:46:42,572
ポルカのハンガーも置いて、ちょっと飾っとくっていうのはどうでしょうか。
how about using the Polka hanger to display it?

571
00:46:42,572 --> 00:46:46,572
服もたくさん出てることだし、いろんなアパレルグッズなんかも最近は出てるので、
Since a lot of clothes and apparel goods have been coming out lately,

572
00:46:46,572 --> 00:46:51,072
いいんじゃないでしょうか、顔面ハンガー。
I think this face hanger is a great idea.

573
00:46:51,072 --> 00:46:55,372
2、3個ぐらい買っといてもいいと思います。
Feel free to buy two or three!

574
00:46:55,372 --> 00:46:57,872
はい、それではですね、最後にこちら!
All right, finally, here is this!

575
00:46:57,872 --> 00:46:59,372
ボイス
Voice

576
00:46:59,372 --> 00:47:02,572
グッズ販売単品でこちら、
Available as a standalone item,

577
00:47:02,572 --> 00:47:07,372
「どきどき♡ハラハラなホテルウェルカムボイス」!
the "Pounding & Heart-pumping Hotel Welcome Voice"!

578
00:47:07,372 --> 00:47:11,872
なんか、ホテルと「ほてる」をちょっとかけてるのかな、これ。
Maybe it's a pun on "hotel" and "flushed"?

579
00:47:11,872 --> 00:47:15,572
ちょっとポルカが名前つけたから、ちょっとわかんないです。
I named it myself, so I'm not even sure.

580
00:47:15,572 --> 00:47:20,572
あ、今回も全部ですね、ポルカが名前をつけているので、
Oh, since I named all the items this time as well,

581
00:47:20,572 --> 00:47:24,572
「あ、センスポルカだ」と思ったら、ポルカやったんな、こいつって思っといてください。
if you think, "That's so Polka," then know that I did my best!

582
00:47:24,572 --> 00:47:29,072
で、ここまでがグッズのご紹介で、フルセットを買うとですね、なんと、
That's it for the merchandise intro. If you buy the full set...

583
00:47:29,072 --> 00:47:31,572
数量限定特典でチェキ風ブロマイドカードがついてきます!
a limited-quantity Cheki-style bromide card is included as a bonus!

584
00:47:31,572 --> 00:47:33,072
フルセット購入特典
Full Set Purchase Bonus

585
00:47:33,072 --> 00:47:37,572
で、こちらちょっと説明が大変なんだ。ポルカ初の数量限定でございます。
Now, explaining this is a bit tricky. It's my first ever limited-quantity item.

586
00:47:37,572 --> 00:47:42,572
まずですね、数量限定の方は直筆メッセージと箔押しの複製サイン入りチェキ風ブロマイドカードがついております。
First, the limited-quantity version has a handwritten message and a foil-stamped reproduced signature.

587
00:47:47,272 --> 00:47:51,072
そして特典ボイスは「今日は少し恥ずかしかったボイス」。
And the bonus voice is the "I Was a Bit Embarrassed Today Voice."

588
00:47:51,072 --> 00:47:54,672
でもこれは共通特典なので、ボイスは両方つきます。
But since it's a common bonus, both sets include the voice.

589
00:47:54,672 --> 00:48:02,072
あの、ついてきます。はい。
Yes, it's included. Okay.

590
00:48:02,072 --> 00:48:07,572
で、あの数量限定じゃない、普通の誕生日記念フルセットには、
Then, for the regular Birthday Celebration Full Set that isn't limited quantity...

591
00:48:07,572 --> 00:48:12,572
普通って言ったらあれだよな、あの、すごーいスペシャルな数量限定バージョンと、
Well, calling it "regular" is a bit much. Between the super special limited version and the...

592
00:48:12,572 --> 00:48:17,072
スペシャル記念日フルセットは、えーと、
Special Anniversary Full Set, um...

593
00:48:17,072 --> 00:48:22,572
直筆メッセージはないんですけれども、同じく箔押し複製サインメッセージ入りチェキ風ブロマイドカードがついており、
It doesn't have a handwritten message, but it still has the foil-stamped reproduced signature and message.

594
00:48:22,572 --> 00:48:27,572
さらにこちらにも「今日は少し恥ずかしかったボイス」がついておりますので、
And since the "I Was a Bit Embarrassed Today Voice" is also included,

595
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:32,072
どちらも甲乙つけがたい内容となっております。
both of them have content that is hard to choose between.

596
00:48:32,072 --> 00:48:38,072
はい、ありがとうございます。
Yes, thank you very much.

597
00:48:38,072 --> 00:48:43,072
そしてですね、あ、これ来ましたよ。最近流行りのじゃない、最近流行りのやつね。
And then, oh, here it is! Not just something trendy, but *the* trendy thing.

598
00:48:43,072 --> 00:48:45,072
はい、こちら!じゃじゃん!
Yes, this! Ta-da!

599
00:48:45,072 --> 00:48:46,572
hololive OFFICIAL CARD GAME PRカード

600
00:48:46,572 --> 00:48:52,572

601
00:48:52,572 --> 00:48:56,572

one card usable in the hololive OFFICIAL CARD GAME is included.

602
00:48:56,572 --> 00:48:59,572
これ1セットに1枚だからね。
That's one card per set, okay?

603
00:48:59,572 --> 00:49:02,072
えー、オフィシャル...失礼いたしました。
Uh, official... excuse me.

604
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:08,572
カードはホロライブプロダクションオフィシャルショップで購入された方のみの対象になっております。
The card is only for those who purchase from the Hololive Production Official Shop.

605
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:14,372
特典につくのはですね、推しをアピールできたりするあの場所に置くやつだな。
The bonus is that one you put in *that* spot to show off your favorite.

606
00:49:14,372 --> 00:49:16,872
キーカード、推しホロメンカードでございます。
It's the Key Card, the "Oshi Holomen Card."

609
00:49:24,072 --> 00:49:27,572
はい、いっぱい告知した。
Whew, that was a lot of announcements.

610
00:49:27,572 --> 00:49:31,572
...と思うじゃん? グッズは以上になるんだけどさ、
...or so you might think. That's all for the merch, but...

611
00:49:31,572 --> 00:49:36,572
もう今回ね、たくさん重大告知っていうものがあるんで。
this time, I have a bunch of major announcements to make.

612
00:49:36,572 --> 00:49:40,572
ポルカね、なかなか重大とか告知とか発表とか使わないんだけど。
I don't usually use words like "major" or "announcement" often,

613
00:49:40,572 --> 00:49:43,572
今回は使っていいかな。
but I think it's okay to use them this time.

614
00:49:43,572 --> 00:49:45,572
まずは1つ目、こちらをどうぞ!
First of all, please take a look at this!

00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:54,680
全部に直筆サインがついた完全受注生産にて発売されます。
it'll be a made-to-order release where every copy comes with a hand-signed signature.

628
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:00,080
ということで、アルバムの現物自体はですね、この後予約開始がされてます。
And so, pre-orders for the physical album itself will start right after this.

629
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:04,280
で、いや、そんな待てねーよ聞けねーよって人の、方の、ために、
And for those who say, "I can't wait that long to listen,"

630
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:10,580
デジタルリリースもこの後0時というか24時から日付変わった瞬間だね、されます。
the digital release will also be available at midnight—well, 24:00—the moment the date changes.

631
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:17,080
ね、えっとですね。先ほど言った直筆サインっていうのは、ええ、限定なんでしょ？と思うあなた。
Now, about that hand-signed signature I mentioned... You're probably thinking, "Wait, isn't that a limited thing?"

632
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:21,080
いやいやいや、あの、アナザージャケット。
No, no, no. There's something called "Another Jackets."

633
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,880
アナザージャケットというものが入っておりまして、こちら5絵柄があるんですけども、
There are five different designs, and one is included at random.

634
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:32,480
その中のランダムで1枚、えー、必ず、イラストはランダムなんですけど、1枚必ず直筆のサインがついてきます。
The illustration is random, but one will definitely have a hand-signed signature.

635
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:38,280
アルバム買った人全員だよ。アルバム買った人全員だからね。全員だよ。すごい。
That's for everyone who buys the album. Every single person who buys it. Everyone. Isn't that amazing?

646
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:59,080
ま、今回のね、あの、ライブのタイトル通り、ま、パペットなんですけれども、
Well, as the title of this live concert suggests, it's called "Puppet,"

647
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:03,480
これがね伏線回収だったとはみんな気づかなかっただろう。
but I bet nobody realized that was foreshadowing.

648
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:10,080
も、そしてこの後、今からね、パペット早速ここで歌うのですが、えー、ちょっとドキドキしてます。
And now, I'm going to perform "Puppet" right here. Um, I'm a little nervous.

649
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,480
あの、ちょっと見たと思うんだけど、えー、cosMo@暴走Pさんに作っていただきました。
You probably saw a glimpse of it, but it was created by cosMo@Bousou-P.

650
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:24,480
で、改めてね、まあこの曲も聴けるということで、アルバムやデジタルリリースもお手に取ったり、えっと、お聞きください。
So, since you can hear this song now, please do check out the album and digital release.

651
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,280
ちょっとあの、ごめ。まじで緊張してるんだ、この曲かっこよすぎて。
Wait, sorry. I'm actually really nervous because this song is just too cool.

652
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:34,080
というわけでですね、改めて、え、実はパペットを含めて、
So, once again... believe it or not, including "Puppet,"

653
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:38,280

Alright then, two songs left! Let's keep the energy up until the very end!

But, but, round and round, round and round it goes

668
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,480

669
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,680
ころころころころ 巡り巡る
Round and round, round and round it goes

The "truth" is—

676
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,380
愛情表現 ヘタクソなまままま
I'm still so clumsy at expressing love

677
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,780

Spinning, falling, being laughed at

678
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,380
きっとこれが 正解な世界！
Surely this is the right world!

679
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,880
間違ってないよね 表情の支配！
I'm not wrong, right? Controlling my expressions!

I'm sorry I can only apologize

690
00:55:27,288 --> 00:55:29,088

Wait, wait, because that's the real...

In the end, becoming sane, in the end...

696
00:55:42,288 --> 00:55:44,288

I want you to love every part of me
