流れてく涙の粒
teardrops flow away.

11
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:10,548
迷いなく包み込む
Without hesitation, I met

温もりに出逢った
an embracing warmth.

13
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:16,248
真っ白な雪のように
Like pure white snow,

00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:19,548
どこまでも素直なコトバ
words are honest everywhere.

15
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:22,548
鉄の羽根纏った
Clad in wings of iron,

16
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,048
僕を動かしてく
they move me forward.

17
00:06:26,548 --> 00:06:29,048
傷つくたびに
Each time I get hurt,

18
00:06:29,248 --> 00:06:31,548
優しくなれる
I become kinder.

19
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:34,548
君のその笑顔だけ
I only want to protect

20
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:38,548
守り抜きたい願いはひとつ
your smile, my one wish.

21
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:44,248
時空を越え刻まれた
Carved beyond time and space,

22
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:47,048
悲しみの記憶
memories of sadness.

23
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:49,848
まっすぐに受け止める
Accepting them directly,

24
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:53,048
君は光の女神
you are an angel of light.

25
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:56,048
あの日の胸に灯った
Lit in my heart that day,

26
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:59,048
永遠の炎
the eternal flame.

27
00:06:59,548 --> 00:07:02,048
深い闇解き放って
Unleashing the deep darkness,

28
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:04,848
自由のトビラ開いてく
opening the door to freedom,

29
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:07,548
強く果てない未来へ
towards a strong, endless future.

30
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:27,048
冷たい緑の月に
In the cold green moon,

31
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:30,048
映し出すココロの夜
reflecting the shadow of my heart.

32
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:33,248
淋し気に呟いた
I whispered lonely,

33
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:36,048
君のそばにいたい
"I want to be by your side."

34
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:39,848
真実と向き合うこと
To face the truth,

35
00:07:40,048 --> 00:07:43,048
教えてくれた勇気は
the courage you taught me

36
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:46,048
僕を駆け巡って
runs through me,

37
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:49,048
夢に目覚めていく
awakening me to the dream.

38
00:07:50,048 --> 00:07:52,548
触れ合う気持ち
So our touching feelings

39
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,048
離れないように
won't separate,

40
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:57,548
しっかりと抱きしめて
holding on tightly,

41
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:01,048
確かな想い貫いてゆく
I'll carry through this certain feeling.

42
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:07,548
銀の海に隠した
Hidden in the silver sea,

43
00:08:07,848 --> 00:08:10,548
空白のページ
a blank page.

44
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:13,548
君だけが知っている
Only you know the truth,

45
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:16,548
本当を僕に見せて
show it to me.

46
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:19,548
吹き荒れる切なさに
In the raging pain,

47
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:22,548
生まれゆく誓い
a vow is born.

48
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:25,548
もう何も怖くはないよ
I'm not afraid anymore,

49
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:28,048
結んだ視線逸らさずに
without averting our gaze.

50
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:32,048
大切な今始める Eternal Blaze
Starting this precious 'now', Eternal Blaze.

51
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:09,048
君が君でいられる場所
A place where you can be yourself,

52
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:12,548
幻に攫われぬように
so illusions won't snatch you away.

53
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:21,548
消えない雨の苦しみも
Even the pain of unending rain,

54
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:28,048
鍵を壊してぶつけてよ
break the lock and crash through.

55
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:33,548
隣にいるから
I'm by your side,

56
00:09:33,848 --> 00:09:36,048

Now, while we are still close enough to wave,

647
00:53:16,515 --> 00:53:19,515
道は別れたばかりで
our paths have just parted.

648
00:53:20,415 --> 00:53:23,715
後ろ髪に風を感じながら
Feeling the wind on the back of my hair,

649

659
00:54:10,215 --> 00:54:13,015
あの日々は
Those days were,

660
00:54:13,615 --> 00:54:16,915
間違いなくわたしの Destiny Ah,
without a doubt, my Destiny. Ah,

661
00:54:28,215 --> 00:54:31,615

どの瞬間もムダじゃないなら
If no moment was a waste,

664
00:54:39,915 --> 00:54:42,615
何が起きても大丈夫
then whatever happens, I'll be okay.

665
00:54:43,815 --> 00:54:45,415
だから
So...

666
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:49,115
