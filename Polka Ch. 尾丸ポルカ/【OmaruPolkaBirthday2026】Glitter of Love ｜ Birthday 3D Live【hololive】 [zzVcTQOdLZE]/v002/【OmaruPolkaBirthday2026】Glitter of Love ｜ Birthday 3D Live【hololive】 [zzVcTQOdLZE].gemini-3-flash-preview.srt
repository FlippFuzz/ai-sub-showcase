ちゃんと見ていたよ
I was watching it properly.

183
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:15,846
閉じ込められそうな
Seemingly trapped,

心を奮い立たせ
stirring up the heart,

185
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:21,446
収まりきらない
uncontainable,

186

emitting a brilliance.

187
00:21:24,046 --> 00:21:27,046

いつものクラス　ナナメ前
In our usual class, diagonally in front of me

00:25:03,444 --> 00:25:06,484
おとなしい君
The quiet you

234
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:09,284
さっそうと現れた
Appeared so gallantly

235

With maxed-out femininity

244
00:25:37,474 --> 00:25:40,474
どこにでもある
It happens everywhere

245
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:43,414
よくあること
A common story

246
00:25:43,414 --> 00:25:46,524
急に彼女が
Suddenly, she said...

247
00:25:46,524 --> 00:25:50,904
「あのね、実は私、好きな人がいるの」って
"Hey, actually, there's someone I like."

252
00:26:08,524 --> 00:26:11,844
まさか自分も立てちゃうなんて
I can't believe I'd set one up myself

253
00:26:11,844 --> 00:26:14,454

It's just too unfortunate

254

00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:40,494
私、困っちゃいます
I'm in a bit of a bind!

259
00:27:01,414 --> 00:27:06,354
乾杯で　お似合いすぎるわ、さては今回
A toast, you two look too good together. Now...

260
00:27:07,254 --> 00:27:11,814
悔しいけど　どうかそんなんじゃなくて本心
It's frustrating, but please, I hope that's not your true heart

261
00:27:12,394 --> 00:27:17,474
っていうか既に　応援モード
Actually, I'm already in support mode

262
00:27:17,474 --> 00:27:22,304
むしろ　すがすがしい
Actually, it feels refreshing

263
00:27:23,304 --> 00:27:25,954
だけど彼女は　不思議な顔
But she had a mysterious look on her face

264
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:28,554
真剣なんだって
She said she was serious

265
00:27:28,884 --> 00:27:31,374
「そうじゃなくて私、あなたが…」
"Not that, I... you..."

266
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:36,304
「好き。ごめん」って
"...like. Sorry."

267
00:27:36,414 --> 00:27:37,584

見てよ！
Look!

279
00:28:29,914 --> 00:28:32,494
きたけどさ、そういう意味じゃなくて…
It came, but I didn't mean it that way...

280
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:34,394
だって女の子同士だし…
I mean, we're both girls...

281
00:28:34,394 --> 00:28:36,894
ねぇ神様、どうしたらいいの？
Hey God, what should I do?

282
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:39,514
私、どうしたいの！？
What do I want to do!?

283
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:41,174
HELP ME!

284
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:46,394
なんか変だ　愛に国境も歳も性別も関係ない
Something's strange. Love has no borders, age, or gender

285
00:28:46,494 --> 00:28:50,094

I was dreaming of a normal love...

289
00:29:08,474 --> 00:29:13,414
ノーマル捨てての私じゃ　ちょっと無理ゲーすぎます
Throwing away "normal" makes this life too much of a "kusoge"

喪失は絶対低度
Loss is at absolute zero

302
00:30:53,192 --> 00:30:57,747
今夜、輪廻召喚、悲しみが
Tonight, reincarnation summon, sadness...

303
00:30:58,303 --> 00:31:03,525
滾々と子守歌歌ってるよ

304
00:31:04,303 --> 00:31:09,636

全てを賭けてみたいの
I want to try betting everything

00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:41,303
切り拓くわ、不死鳥の炎解いて
I will cut through, unravelling the phoenix's flames

311
00:31:41,747 --> 00:31:43,858
あなたの手
Your hand...

312
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:48,747
ブラック・ブラック、眼差し 泣きたくなるの
Black, black, that gaze makes me want to cry

313
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:52,636
フラッシュバック、フラッシュバック、振りほどけ

アセット、挑み続けろ
Asset, keep on challenging

315
00:31:56,636 --> 00:32:01,525
飄々と佇むホット・ショット
An aloof-standing hot shot

316
00:32:02,192 --> 00:32:06,636
私が必要でしょう？
You need me, don't you?

317
00:32:07,414 --> 00:32:11,747
今夜、輪廻召喚、正しさが
Tonight, reincarnation summon, correctness...

318
00:32:12,192 --> 00:32:17,525
それらしい最前線に押し出すよ

00:32:58,192 --> 00:33:02,636
ブラック・ブラック、彼方越し光を見せて
Black, black, show me the light from beyond

328
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:06,636
フラッシュバック、フラッシュバック、許さない

331
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:21,525
鼓動が速くて目眩がする

332
00:33:22,192 --> 00:33:26,636
全て捧げる、もう決めたの
I'll offer everything, I've already decided

Lyrics: hal  Composition/Arrangement: Yoko Kanno

349
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:13,617
嗚呼...
Ah...

350
00:35:16,717 --> 00:35:20,517
神様に恋をしていた頃は
Back when I was in love with God,

351
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:31,517
こんな別れが来るとは思ってなかったよ
I never thought a farewell like this would come.

352
00:35:32,117 --> 00:35:35,117
嗚呼...
Ah...

353
00:35:36,617 --> 00:35:41,917
もう二度と触れられないなら
If I can never touch you again,

354
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:51,617
せめて最後に、もう一度抱きしめて欲しかったよ
I wanted you to hold me at least one last time.

355
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:54,117
嗚呼...
Ah...

356
00:35:54,317 --> 00:36:00,117
It's long long goodbye... さよなら、さよなら。
It's long long goodbye... Goodbye, goodbye.

357
00:36:00,317 --> 00:36:10,117
何度だって、自分に無情に言い聞かせて
No matter how many times, I heartlessly tell myself.

358
00:36:10,617 --> 00:36:16,917
手を振るのは優しさだよ、ね、嗚呼...
Waving goodbye is an act of kindness, right? Ah...

359
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:21,917
今、強さが欲しい
Now, I want strength.

360
00:36:23,317 --> 00:36:29,717
あなたに出会い、さあ輝いて、私が生まれて
Meeting you, now I shine, and I am born.

361
00:36:29,817 --> 00:36:35,917
愛すればこそ、愛あればこそ
Precisely because I love you, because love exists.

362
00:36:36,417 --> 00:36:42,917
希望のない奇跡を待ってどうなるの
What happens if I wait for a miracle without hope?

363
00:36:43,217 --> 00:36:51,717
涙に滲む、星の瞬きは...
The twinkling of the stars, blurred by tears, is...

364
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:21,117
忘れないよ、あなたの温もりも
I won't forget, even your warmth.

365
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:32,517
その優しさも、すべて包んでくれた両手も
And that kindness, and your hands that held it all.

366
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:43,517
It's long long goodbye... さよなら、さよなら。
It's long long goodbye... Goodbye, goodbye.

367
00:37:44,117 --> 00:37:50,917
愛おしい人、あなたがいたから歩いてこれた
My beloved, I could walk because you were here.

368
00:37:51,117 --> 00:37:57,417
ひとりなんかじゃなかったよね、嗚呼...
I wasn't alone, was I? Ah...

369
00:37:58,117 --> 00:38:02,617
今、答えが欲しい
Now, I want an answer.

370
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:13,217
燃えるような流星、捕まえて、火を灯して
Catch the burning shooting stars, light a fire.

371
00:38:13,317 --> 00:38:19,517
愛していたい、愛されてたい
I want to keep loving, I want to be loved.

372
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:26,417
冷えた体、一つで世界はどうなるの
What happens to the world with just one cold body?

373
00:38:26,617 --> 00:38:34,117
貼り続けてた、虚勢が溶けていく、long fall
The bluff I kept putting up melts away, long fall.

374
00:38:34,217 --> 00:38:41,317
どうしてなんだろう
I wonder why it is so.

375
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:59,117
涙溢れて、止められない
Tears overflow, and I can't stop them.

376
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:19,317
あなたに出会い、さあ輝いて、私が生まれて
Meeting you, now I shine, and I am born.

377
00:39:19,517 --> 00:39:25,617
愛すればこそ、愛あればこそ
Precisely because I love you, because love exists.

378
00:39:26,117 --> 00:39:32,617
希望のない奇跡を待ってどうなるの
What happens if I wait for a miracle without hope?

379
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:39,117
涙に滲む、星の瞬きは...
The twinkling of the stars, blurred by tears, is...

380
00:39:39,617 --> 00:39:46,117
もし生まれ変わって、また巡り会うのなら
If I am reborn and we meet again,

381
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:52,617
その時もきっと、私を見つけ出して
then surely find me in that moment too.

382
00:39:53,117 --> 00:39:59,617
もう二度と離さないで、捕まえてて
Don't ever let me go again, keep holding onto me.

383
00:40:00,092 --> 00:40:02,230
ひとりじゃないと
That I am not alone

384
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,197
囁いてほしい
I want you to whisper

385
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:12,392
プラネット
Planet

If your holy eyes reflect pain

389
00:41:13,522 --> 00:41:20,592
振り向いてごらん 情熱放つトリック
Look back and see, the trick that releases passion

390
00:41:20,592 --> 00:41:25,230
崩れる足元 二人は戻れない
Our footing crumbles, the two of us cannot return

391
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:31,992
差し伸べた手をほどかないで
Do not let go of the hand I've reached out

392

消えるよまた 優しい日々が

If resurrected, this fleeting life

409
00:43:03,756 --> 00:43:09,192
繰り返す愛しさが 導いた

525
00:53:19,615 --> 00:53:30,615
後ろ髪に風を感じながら
While feeling the wind against the back of my head

526
00:53:31,615 --> 00:53:38,615
それまでの全てが　あなたに出会うためだった
Everything until then was all for the sake of meeting you

527
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:46,915
どの瞬間もムダじゃないこと　本当の意味で知れたから
Because I've learned in the truest sense that no moment was in vain
