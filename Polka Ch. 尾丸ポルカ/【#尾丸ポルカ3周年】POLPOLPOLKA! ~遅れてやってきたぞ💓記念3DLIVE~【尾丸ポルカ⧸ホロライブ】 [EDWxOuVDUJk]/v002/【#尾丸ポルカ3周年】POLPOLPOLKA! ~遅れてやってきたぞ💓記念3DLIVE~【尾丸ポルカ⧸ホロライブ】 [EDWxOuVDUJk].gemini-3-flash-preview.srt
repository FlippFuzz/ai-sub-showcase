Flaring up at defeat. If lined up, it's a jackpot.

吐き気を飲み込む
Swallowing the nausea.

38
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:22,508
電落 幕が開けた空 オノマトペ
The curtain falls on the sky, Onomatopoeia.

39
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:26,508
着飾る人形は ピエロにくちづけを
The dressed-up doll kisses the clown.

40
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:33,008
本日大団円 脚本が笑う 騙されてくれるアナタとショー
A grand finale today. The script laughs. A show with you who'll be deceived.

41
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:37,008
アタシ今ここで 何をしてる？
What am I doing here now?

42
00:09:40,008 --> 00:09:43,008
盛り上がってますかー！？
Are you hyped!?

43
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:46,508

45
00:09:57,008 --> 00:10:00,008
フォーカスされた日常 引き金を抱いて
Focused daily life. Embracing the trigger.

46
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,316
フォーカスされた日常 引き金を抱いて
Focused daily life, holding the trigger

47
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:03,916
心中するように
As if committing double suicide

48
00:10:04,316 --> 00:10:07,216
一回 二回 三回 嘘を重ねて
Once, twice, three times, piling up lies

49
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:11,216
十回 百回 億回 瞳もそらして
Ten, hundred, hundred million times, avert your eyes too

50
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:14,516
あれ何だっけかな
What was that again?

51
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:16,416
アタシは誰
Who am I?

52
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,116
もうウンザリした 仮面舞踏会
I'm already fed up with this masquerade ball

53
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:24,016
とりとめのないワルツでお迎え
Welcoming with an endless waltz

54
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,516
贋作の中 おどけてみせて
In the forgery, show me your playfulness

55
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:30,516
おどけてみせてよ
Show me your playfulness

56
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:34,216
アタシの世界は ぐるぐる ぐるぐる
My world is spinning, spinning

57
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:38,216
ぐるぐる ぐるぐる 廻っていく
Spinning, spinning, it goes around

58
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:41,816
遍路幕が開けた そのオノマトペ
The pilgrimage curtain opened, that onomatopoeia

59
00:10:42,316 --> 00:10:45,316
群がる人形は ダリアの花束を
The swarming dolls hold a bouquet of dahlias

60
00:10:45,816 --> 00:10:49,016
選んでくれた服を着て 踊りましょう
Wearing the clothes you chose for me, let's dance

61
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:52,516
騙されてくれる貴方達と
With you all who let yourselves be deceived

62
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:58,216
いいよ もう これが好きだったわけだろ？
Fine, already, this is what you liked, right?

63
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:12,516
振り落とせ ペルソナを
Shake off the persona

64
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:24,516
振り落とせ ペルソナを
Shake off the persona

65
00:11:30,016 --> 00:11:33,216
とっくに終わった
The tragedy that ended long ago

66
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:37,016
悲劇は喜劇と化してなお
has turned into a comedy, and yet

67
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:39,516
(今 普通に楽しかったよ)
(It was normally fun today)

68
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:43,516
さあ 刮目してくれよ
Now, keep your eyes open

69
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:47,316
本当の僕は
Because the real me

70
00:11:47,316 --> 00:11:49,816
アタシじゃないから
is not "atashi"

71
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:53,016
(今日も普通に楽しかったよ)
(It was normally fun today too)

72
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:55,216
何故
Why

73
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:02,816
遍路幕が閉じた そのオノマトペ
The pilgrimage curtain closed, that onomatopoeia

74
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:06,216
着せ替え人形と 断絶のアンコール
A dress-up doll and an encore of severing

75
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:10,016
本日 大団円 脚本が笑う
Today, a grand finale, the script laughs

76
00:12:10,516 --> 00:12:14,016
どうしようもないよな
It can't be helped, right?

77
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,816
ああ どこの誰でもいい
Ah, anyone from anywhere is fine

78
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:20,116
「調子に乗るなよ」と ただ一回言ってくれ
Just tell me "Don't get cocky" once

79
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:23,516
そういや ユングも 散々言ってたな
Come to think of it, Jung also said it quite a lot

80
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:27,016
もう後戻りは叶わないと
That there's no turning back now

81
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:31,516
気付けばそこには 一人で
Before I knew it, I was there alone

82
00:13:09,516 --> 00:13:13,516
まもなく 開演の時間です
The curtain time is approaching

83

87
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:42,216

Alright, and so without further ado, I'd like to move on to the next song!

91
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:58,216
おや？ あんなところに可愛い猫ちゃんが。
Oh? There's a cute kitty over there.

92
00:13:59,016 --> 00:14:01,816
おいおいおい！誰が猫や！こちとら狐じゃい！
Hey, hey, hey! Who are you calling a cat! I'm a fox!

93
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:03,816
まあまあ、落ち着いて、フブちゃん。
Now, now, calm down, Fubu-chan.

94
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:07,416
フブちゃんが猫になってくれないと、この曲は成立しないんだって。
This song won't work unless Fubu-chan becomes a cat.

95
00:14:07,516 --> 00:14:09,516
はい、ステイ、ステイ、ステイ...。ニャンニャン♪
Alright, stay, stay, stay... Nyan nyan♪

96
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,216
どういうことだ、聞いてねえぞ、ポルカ！
What do you mean, I didn't hear about this, Polka!

97
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,616
いやー、もちろんフブちゃんはそつなくこなしてくれると思いますので。
Well, of course, I think Fubu-chan will handle it perfectly, so.

98
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:18,516
ニャンニャン♪ ポルカも猫だったニャン♪
Nyan nyan♪ Polka was a cat too, nyan♪

99
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:22,016
おお、素晴らしきニャン生。
Oh, a wonderful cat's life.

真っ白な毛がとても素敵ね
Your pure white fur is very lovely

103
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,816
こんな月が綺麗な夜は
On a night with such a beautiful moon

104
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:49,216
僕と一緒に遊びませんか
Would you like to come play with me?

105
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,816
ニャン生は一度きり
A cat's life is only once

106
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:57,216
楽しむが勝ちなのです
The one who enjoys it is the winner

107
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,624
あなたを縛る首輪は
The collar that binds you

108
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:05,824
噛み千切ってあげましょう
I'll bite it off for you

109
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:10,524
野良は最高 ニャンニャンニャン
Strays are the best, meow meow meow

110
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:13,424
魚くすねて、ハト追いかけて
Snatching fish, chasing pigeons

111
00:15:13,724 --> 00:15:18,024
昼間は働く人間を 尻目に屋根の上で夢うつつ
While people work during the day, I doze on the roof watching them

112
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:20,524
あなたも自由に ニャンニャンニャン
You can be free too, meow meow meow

素敵な仲間も紹介しましょう
I'll introduce you to some wonderful friends

114
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:27,424
さあ、その窓を開いて
Now, open that window

115
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:29,624
飛び出すのです！
And jump out!

116
00:15:38,224 --> 00:15:40,824
これは気ままな野良猫さん
This is a carefree stray cat

117
00:15:41,124 --> 00:15:43,124
闇の中目だけが光ってる
Only eyes shining in the darkness

118
00:15:43,424 --> 00:15:46,024
随分口が上手だけど
You've got a silver tongue

119
00:15:46,324 --> 00:15:48,324
私はバカな女じゃないわ
But I'm no foolish girl

120
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:53,324
ニャン生は一度きり
A cat's life is but once

121
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:58,324
だからこそ飼われるのよ！
That's exactly why I'm kept!

122
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:03,324
ブランド首輪の価値が
The value of a designer collar...

123
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:05,624
あなたには分かるかしら？
...would you understand it?

124
00:16:08,124 --> 00:16:10,024
私は優雅よ ニャンニャンニャン
I am elegant, meow meow meow

125
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:12,824
美味しい食事にふかふかベッド
Delicious meals and a fluffy bed

126
00:16:13,124 --> 00:16:17,324
水はちょっぴり苦手だけど 毎日シャワーだって浴びれるの
I'm a bit bad with water, but I can even take a shower every day

127
00:16:17,924 --> 00:16:22,524
それに比べて ニャンニャンニャン あなたは誰に守ってもらうの？
Compared to that, meow meow meow, who is going to protect you?

128
00:16:22,824 --> 00:16:26,524
明日車にひかれるかも
You might get hit by a car tomorrow...

129
00:16:27,224 --> 00:16:29,624
知れないじゃない！
...you never know!

130
00:16:37,724 --> 00:16:42,324
そんな強気なとこも素敵です
That confidence of yours is also wonderful

131
00:16:42,624 --> 00:16:47,324
一層あなたを好きになりました
I've come to like you even more

132
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:52,324
あら正直ね、でもそんなやり方じゃ
Well, you're honest, but doing it that way...

133
00:16:52,624 --> 00:16:55,624
ココロ揺らがないわ
...won't shake my heart

134
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:01,824
僕の夢は ニャンニャンニャン
My dream is, meow meow meow

135
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:04,724
いつかはこの街を飛び出して
To one day leap out of this town

136
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,624
はるか北の国に旅して オーロラをこの目で見ることです
To travel to a far northern land and see the aurora with my own eyes

137
00:17:09,924 --> 00:17:14,524
そこにあなたが ニャンニャンニャン 居てくれたらなんて素敵でしょう
If you were there with me, meow meow meow, how wonderful it would be

138
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:19,424
だけどそれは叶わないらしい
But it seems that won't come true

139
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:24,424
生き方は ニャンニャンニャン そう簡単には変えられないの
Our way of life, meow meow meow, can't be changed that easily

140
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:29,324
それに私を飼っている 女の子を一人にできないわ
Besides, I can't leave the girl who's keeping me all alone

141
00:17:29,624 --> 00:17:32,424
話の途中よ ニャンニャンニャン
I'm in the middle of talking, meow meow meow

142
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:34,724
あらもう行っちゃうの？ねえちょっと！
Oh, are you leaving already? Hey, wait!

143
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:39,724
明日もここに来ていいのよ
You can come here tomorrow too, you know

144
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:42,524
待ってるから
I'll be waiting

145
00:18:07,824 --> 00:18:11,724
やあ、やっぱり猫は難しい。もう猫はやめるにゃん。
Yeah, being a cat is hard after all. I'm done with being a cat-nyan.

146
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,424
どうしたんですか、ポルカ先輩？
What's the matter, Polka-senpai?

147
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:21,024
おお、そこにいるのはバリバリで仕事できの女幹部のルイ君じゃないか！ハハハ、ホロクスの調子はどうだい？
Oh, if it isn't the super-efficient female executive, Lui-kun! Hahaha, how's HoloX doing?

148
00:18:22,024 --> 00:18:24,824
はい、今日も仕事100件こなしてきましたよ。
Yes, I've handled 100 jobs today as well.

149
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:34,024
それならば教えてくれないか、あの、女の子を優しくこう誘う術をね。
In that case, could you teach me... you know, the way to gently invite a girl like that?

150
00:18:35,024 --> 00:18:40,024
それならポルカ先輩、私たちで王子様になりましょう。
If that's the case, Polka-senpai, let's both become princes.

151
00:18:40,524 --> 00:18:42,524
それはなんか、そっちで急だね。
That's... kind of sudden on your end.

152
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:45,624
キザなくらいがこれから流行りますから。
Being a bit cheesy is going to be the trend from now on.

153
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:46,524
確かに。
True.

154
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:49,024
仕事100件こなしてきましたから。
I've handled 100 jobs, after all.

155
00:18:49,224 --> 00:18:50,024
確かに。
True.

156
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:55,224
さあ、行きますよ。一緒にジュリエッタを迎えに行きましょう。
Now, let's go. Let's go pick up Juliet together.

157
00:18:55,524 --> 00:18:59,024
俺の…ジュリエッタ。
My... Juliet.

158
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:17,324
ロメオ
Romeo

159
00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:33,424
初めましてお嬢さん 西の国から
Pleased to meet you, my lady, from the land in the west

160
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:37,324
愛の為に貴女に会いに来ました
I have come to see you for the sake of love

161
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:40,424
急な話ですがどうか驚かないで
This is sudden, but please don't be surprised

162
00:19:40,824 --> 00:19:44,224
僕のお姫様にね なってください
Please become my princess

163
00:19:58,324 --> 00:20:00,024
悩んでるのお嬢さん
Are you troubled, my lady?

164
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,332
似合わないな 少ない顔は
A sad face doesn't suit you.

165
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:04,332
似合わないよ ほらほら耳を貸してよ
It really doesn't. Hey, listen to me.

166
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:07,832
もしよろしければですが 俺と一緒に
If you don't mind, why don't you come with me...

167
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:11,332
全て捨てて逃げよう 東の国へ
...and leave everything behind for the Eastern country.

168
00:20:12,432 --> 00:20:18,032
寂しそうなその紅い唇に
On those lonely red lips...

169
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:24,432
優しい魔法かけるよ
...I'll cast a gentle spell.

170
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:27,432

誰もが貴女を欲しがって
Everyone wants you,

174

184
00:21:21,032 --> 00:21:21,932
選んで？
Choose?

185
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:28,432
渡したくない他の誰かには
I don't want to give you to anyone else.

186
00:21:28,732 --> 00:21:34,532
譲れないのさ 誰にも
I can't let anyone have you.

187
00:21:35,432 --> 00:21:38,232
さあさ裸足で駆け出せ
Now, run out barefoot,

188
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:42,132
世界一のお姫様 夢の世界へ
the most beautiful princess in the world. To a dream world.

189
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:45,632
不安な思いは消し去って

手を繋いで連れてくよ

198
00:22:58,532 --> 00:23:02,132
靴の底がすり減ってる
The soles of my shoes are worn out.

199
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:06,132
まるで今のココロみたい
Just like my heart right now.

200
00:23:06,632 --> 00:23:13,632
他人と深く解り合うって 難しいと感じたよ
I felt that understanding others deeply is difficult.

201
00:23:14,332 --> 00:23:21,032
うなずく事しかできない 自分嫌いになってる
I'm starting to hate myself for only being able to nod.

202
00:23:21,832 --> 00:23:29,132
世の中には思い通りに いかないことあるけれど
There are things in this world that don't go as planned...

203
00:23:29,832 --> 00:23:37,032
落ち込むだけ落ち込んだら 笑ってまた歩かなきゃ
...but once I've felt as down as I can, I have to smile and walk again.

204
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:44,732
だけどゆずれない大切な物は 守りとおしたい
But I want to protect the precious things I can't give up.

205
00:23:45,332 --> 00:23:52,132
ユメ実現するための犠牲は もうヤダよ
I'm done with sacrifices to make dreams come true.

206
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:59,832
気持ちに嘘つくような事はやめて YESのイイコは卒業しよう
Let's stop lying to our feelings and graduate from being a "yes" person.

207
00:24:00,632 --> 00:24:07,432
そうすればきっと自分のことを 好きになれるはずだよ
Then, I'm sure I'll be able to like myself.

208
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:11,232
強気でいこう

一目惚れで恋におちた 彼とは2年たったけど
It's been two years since I fell in love at first sight with him...

210
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:33,232
ドアを閉めた音でわかる もうだめだね私達
...but I can tell by the sound of the door closing. We're done.

211
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:40,832
誰かと私の間を 行ったり来たりしてると
Going back and forth between someone else and me...

212
00:24:41,632 --> 00:24:48,332
気づいていたけど ひとりになるの怖かった
I noticed it, but I was afraid of being alone.

213

魂を売るようなこと（は）やめて 都合のイイコは卒業しよう
Let's stop doing things like selling our souls and graduate from being a convenient person.

214
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,032
迷いのある人生だって
Even in a life full of hesitation...

215
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,840
いいやだ！
No way!

216
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,140
どんな悩みだって
No matter what kind of worries,

217
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,840
超えてみせる
I'll show you I can overcome them.

218
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,140
嫌われたくない想いが
The desire not to be hated

219
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,040
自由の羽根　踏みつけた
stepped on the wings of freedom.

220
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,040
飛べないまま終わりたくない
I don't want to end without being able to fly;

221
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,040
想いのまま生きていたい
I want to live as my heart desires.

222
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,540
気持ちに嘘つくような事は
Stop lying to your feelings;

223
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,540
やめてYESのイイコは卒業しよう
let's graduate from being a "yes" girl.

224
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,540
そうすればきっと自分のことを
Then you'll surely be able

225
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,040
スキになれるはずだよ
to love yourself.

226
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,040
強気でいこう
Let's go with a strong heart!

227
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,540
迷いのある人生だっていいよ
A life with hesitation is fine too.

228
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,540

No matter what kind of worries,

229
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:15,040
超えてみせる
I'll show you I can overcome them.

230
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,440

There's only one of you;

231
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,540
スキになろう
let's learn to love yourself.

232
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,340
ポルカ！
Polka!

233
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,240
え？
Eh?

234
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,240
ヌーべいいよね。
Nube is good, isn't it?

235
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,940
船長、来てくれたんか？
Sencho, you came?

236
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,040
そうだよポルカ、船長もポルカと歌いたいなって思ったんだ。
That's right, Polka. I thought I wanted to sing with you too.

237
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,340
ありがとう船長。やっぱりアニソンって最高だよな。
Thanks, Sencho. Anime songs are the best after all.

238
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,840
あの、ポルカさ、ずっと歌いたかった曲があるんだけど...
Um, there's a song I've always wanted to sing...

239
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,040
一緒に歌ってくれてもいいかな？
Would you mind singing it with me?

240
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,540
いいよポルカ、歌ってあげるよ。
Sure, Polka, I'll sing it with you.

241
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,940
優しいな。
You're so kind.

242
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,640
なんかセリフとかも言っちゃっていいかな？ノリにも乗っちゃっていいかな？
Is it okay if I say some lines? Can I get into the groove too?

243
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,540
いいよポルカ！今日は全肯定してあげるよ！
It's okay, Polka! Today, I'll affirm everything you do!

244
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,840
やったぜ！聞いてください、「Get along」！
Alright! Please listen to "Get along"!

245
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,940
暴れるモンスターあれば、とことん打ちのめし！
If there's a rampaging monster, I'll crush it to pieces!

輝くお宝あれば、無理矢理ひとり占め！
If there's a shining treasure, I'll take it all for myself by force!

248
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,040
大胆素敵、電光石火！勝利はあたしたちのためにある！
Bold and beautiful, lightning-fast! Victory is for us!

249
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,040
立ち向かう先に乾いた風
A dry wind ahead as we face forward,

250
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,040
激しく吹き荒れても
even if it blows fiercely.

251
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,440
呪文のひとつも唱えたなら
If I chant even just one spell,

252
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,540
私のペースになる
it'll be my pace.

253
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,940
誰もがうらやむこのパワーと
This power that everyone envies

254
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,440
美貌が許さないわ
and my beauty won't allow it.

255
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,440
どんな相手でもひるまないで
Don't flinch against any opponent,

256
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,440
マントをなびかせるの
letting my cloak flutter.

257
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,840
あれもしたい これもしたい
I want to do that, I want to do this.

258
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,840
女の子に見えたって
Even if I look like a girl,

259
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,040
油断したら地獄行きよ
if you let your guard down, you're going to hell.

260
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,540
邪魔はさせないから
I won't let you get in the way.

261
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,040
Far away 思うまま我儘に
Far away, just as I think, selfishly,

262
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,540
旅を続けて行きたい
I want to continue the journey.

263
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,540
辛い日々も笑顔でピリオドよ
Put a period to the hard days with a smile.

264
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,240
Far away 幾つもの魔力抱いて
Far away, embracing many magical powers,

265
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,540
今日を越えて行きたいの
I want to go beyond today.

266
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,040
未来に向かい歩き続けて行く
Continuing to walk towards the future,

267
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,040
限りないほど
endlessly.

268
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,540
Get along , Try again
Get along, Try again.

269
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,740
退屈な時は悪い奴ら
When I'm bored, the bad guys

270
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,840
ターゲットに気晴らし

おあずけ 夢の3SEVEN
Put on hold, the dream 3SEVEN

596
00:50:21,298 --> 00:50:23,710
I could not look back,

597
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:31,140
you'd gone away from me

598
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:33,920
I felt my heart ache

599
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:41,480
I was afraid of following you

600
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,880
When I had looked at

601
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:51,420
the shadows on the wall

602
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,620
I started running into the night

603
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:03,090
to find the truth in me

604
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:12,520

606
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:33,990
嵐吹くこの街が
This city where the storm blows

607
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:37,480
お前を抱く
Embraces you

608
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,990
吹き抜ける風にさえ
Even in the wind that blows through

609
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,020
目を閉じる
I close my eyes

610
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:46,510
お前は走り出す
You start running

611
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:49,310
何かに追われるよう
As if being chased by something

612
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,510
俺が見えないのか
Can't you see me?

613
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:55,310
すぐそばにいるのに
Even though I'm right beside you

614
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:09,510
人波に消えて行く
Disappearing into the crowd

615
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:12,310
記憶の吐息
Breaths of memory

616
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:15,510
愛のない一人舞台
A loveless one-person stage

617
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:18,310
もう耐えきれない
I can't take it anymore

618
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:21,710
All of you in my memory

619
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:24,410
is still shining in my heart

620
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:27,510
すれ違う心は
Our passing hearts

621
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:31,310
溢れる涙に濡れ
Are drenched in overflowing tears

622
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:41,410
紅に染まったこの俺を
Me, dyed in crimson

623
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:47,610
慰める奴は もういない
There's no one left to comfort me

624
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:53,810
もう二度と届かないこの思い
This feeling that will never reach you again

625
00:53:54,110 --> 00:54:02,110
閉ざされた愛に向かい 叫びつづける
Towards a closed-off love, I keep on screaming

626
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:13,410
お前は走り出す
You start running

627
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:16,210
何かに追われるよう
As if being chased by something

628
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:19,410
俺が見えないのか
Can't you see me?

629
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:22,210
すぐそばにいるのに
Even though I'm right beside you

630
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:33,510
紅に染まったこの俺を
Me, dyed in crimson

631
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:39,710
慰める奴は もういない
There's no one left to comfort me

632
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:45,910
もう二度と届かないこの思い
This feeling that will never reach you again

633
00:54:46,210 --> 00:55:00,080
閉ざされた愛に向かい 叫びつづける
Towards a closed-off love, I keep on screaming

634
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:04,088
慰める奴はもういない
There's no one left to comfort me

635
00:55:07,088 --> 00:55:09,588
Oh, cry in deep red

636
00:55:35,188 --> 00:55:37,388
おうちにいたって通常運転だい！

どうしようもない言葉ばっか
Just useless words all the time

641
00:55:54,688 --> 00:55:56,888
考えても消耗以外
Even if I think, it's just exhausting

642
00:55:57,088 --> 00:55:59,388
コントローラー両手に持って
Holding the controller with both hands

643
