レッテル貼られて悪くはない
Being labeled isn't so bad

112

あの子みたいになれなくて
But I couldn't be like her

121
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:22,378
楽しくて 満たされて
Until it ends with being fun, being fulfilled,

122
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:24,778
もういいやって終わるまで
and saying "I'm done"

123
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:27,978
最初ってそんなもんで
That's how it is at first

124
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:30,478
自分に言い聞かせて
I keep telling myself

125
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:32,978
でもいっそ 足りなくて
But rather, it's not enough,

126
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:35,778
もういいやって止まれない
and I can't stop even if I say "I'm done"

127
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:38,278
気づいた時私は
By the time I realized,

128
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:41,178
何者かになりたくて
I wanted to become someone

129
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:43,778
だんだん周りが見えてきたんだ
Gradually I started to see my surroundings,

130
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:46,278
ライバルが立ち並んで
with rivals standing all around

131
00:11:46,378 --> 00:11:48,778
だんだん私の立場も見えて
Gradually I saw my own position,

132
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:51,278
大したことないな
and realized it's nothing much

133
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,778
レッテル貼られて悪くはない
Being labeled isn't so bad

134
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:56,178
スパイスなんだけど今までは
It was a spice, but until now...

135
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:58,678
言いたいだけなのよ
I just want to say it

136
00:11:58,778 --> 00:12:02,178
ここで勝たなきゃもう人生一生止まって
If I don't win here, my life will stop forever

137
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:04,278
じゃあ私にできることは何
So, what is it that I can do?

138
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:06,378
さあ私にできることは何
Come on, what is it that I can do?

139
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:08,978
努力したけど それじゃダメなのと
I made an effort, but will I struggle forever

140
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:11,978
一生もがんだか
knowing it's no good?

141
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,178
あの子みたいになりたくて
I wanted to be like that girl

142
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:20,978
あの子みたいになれなくて
But I couldn't be like her

143
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:46,178
どんどん周りと距離が離れて
More and more the distance from others grows,

144
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:48,678
ライバルですらなくて
I'm not even a rival

145
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:51,278
どんどん私の足元崩れて
More and more the ground beneath my feet crumbles,

146
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:54,178
このまま落ちようか
shall I just fall?

147
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:58,278
あのね私ルーザーガール
You know, I'm a loser girl

148
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:02,978
待って置いていかないでよなんて
Wait, don't leave me behind, or something like that

149
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:08,378
あのね私ルーザーガール
You know, I'm a loser girl

150
00:13:08,978 --> 00:13:13,478
だって開き直るしかないじゃん
Because I have no choice but to be defiant

151
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:18,778
レッテル貼られて悪くはない
Being labeled isn't so bad

152
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:21,478
仕方がないけど今までは
It can't be helped, but until now...

153
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:23,878
生き抜くためなのよ
It's for the sake of surviving

154
00:13:23,978 --> 00:13:27,178
ここで見せなきゃもう人生一生止まって
If I don't show it here, my life will stop forever

155
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:29,478
じゃあ私にできることは何
So, what is it that I can do?

156
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:31,778
さあ私にできることは何
Come on, what is it that I can do?

157
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,378
誰か教えて それじゃダメなのと
Someone tell me, will I struggle forever

158
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:36,978
一生もがんだか
knowing it's no good?

159
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:39,678
努力したけど それじゃダメなのと
I made an effort, but will I struggle forever

160
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,378
一生もがんだか
knowing it's no good?

161
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:45,478
あの子みたいになりたくて
I wanted to be like that girl

162
00:13:47,178 --> 00:13:51,478
あの子みたいになれなくて
But I couldn't be like her

163
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:59,978
この世界のトップアイドルとの出会い
Meeting with the top idols of this world

164
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,578
ひよこの声がしたのは、こっちの方かな？
Did Hiyoko's voice come from this way?

165
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:11,478
なんかすごい盛り上がってたけど、
It seemed really lively,

166
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:14,378
もしかして、アイドルライブ？
could it be an idol live?

167
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:17,278
あ！
Ah!

168
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:18,978
あれ？
Wait?

169
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:21,478
やっぱり！アイドルライブじゃん！
I knew it! It is an idol live!

170
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,978
ねぇ、なんでそんな笑ってないの？
Hey, why aren't you guys smiling?

171
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:28,078
え？やっぱりさ、おかしいよね？違法なアイドルライブなんて。
Eh? It really is strange, right? An illegal idol live.

172
00:14:28,478 --> 00:14:30,678
今のアイドルってどうなっちゃったの？
What's happened to idols nowadays?

173
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:33,778
ねぇ、もっとキラキラしてるアイドルに、
Hey, I want to become a more sparkling idol,

174
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:36,078
ポルカ、もう一回なりたいよ！
Polka wants to become one again!

175
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:38,278
どうすればいいの？
What should I do?

176
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,278
ダメなのだよ。
It's no good.

177
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:40,878
え？
Eh?

178
00:14:40,978 --> 00:14:43,378
アイドルは笑顔なんて見せないのら。
Idols don't show smiles.

179
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:44,378
そんな…
No way...

180
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:46,678
アイドルはみんなの手の届かない、
Idols are beings out of everyone's reach,

181
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:49,178
神聖で素晴らしいもの。
sacred and wonderful.

182
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,678
あなたもこうなりたいなら、頑張るしかないね。
If you want to be like this too, you'll just have to do your best.

183
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:56,478
え？いやいや、やっぱりそんなのおかしいって。
Eh? No, no, that's definitely wrong.

184
00:14:58,178 --> 00:15:00,578
それに、ファンの皆はそもそも…
And besides, the fans in the first place...

185
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:03,136
そんなこと...
Something like that...

186
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,736
望んでるのかな?
I wonder if they want that?

187
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:07,036
おっ...
Oh...

188
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:08,236
あっ、座員くん!
Ah, Zain-kun!

189
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:09,736
え、ちょっと待って!
Wait, hold on!

190
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:12,436
座員くん!
Zain-kun!

191
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:18,736
待って、ねえ!
Wait, hey!

192
00:15:18,736 --> 00:15:21,336
君、座員くんだよね?
You're Zain-kun, right?

193
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:22,936
あ、あれ?
Huh?

194
00:15:22,936 --> 00:15:24,936
どっか行っちゃった。
He went somewhere.

195
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,736
あれ...私、どうしたんだっけ?
Wait... what happened to me?

196
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:34,336
ここ、どこだっけ?
Where am I?

197
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:36,436
あれ? ああ、分かんないや。
Wait? Oh, I don't know.

198
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:41,036
アリーナなのに、
Even though it's an arena,

199
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:43,436
アリーナみたいじゃない。そんな気がするし。
it doesn't feel like one. At least that's how it feels.

200
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,736
座員くんも夢?
Was Zain-kun a dream too?

201
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:48,736
何が正しいの?
What is the right thing?

202
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:50,936
アイドルって何?
What is an idol?

203
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:53,936
笑うことがアイドルじゃないの?
Isn't being an idol about smiling?

204
00:15:54,936 --> 00:15:57,636
アイドルって、笑わせて、笑ってもらって、
An idol makes people laugh, gets laughed at,

205
00:15:57,636 --> 00:16:00,436
笑顔を振りまいてさ。
and spreads smiles around.

206
00:16:01,736 --> 00:16:04,936
そうじゃないんだ、今は。もう...
That's not how it is now. Enough already...

207
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:08,436
そっか。
I see.

208
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:15,336
こんな世界、おかしいよ!
This world is just wrong!

209
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:21,336
全部壊れちゃえばいいのに。
I wish everything would just break.

210
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:40,736
Hello! Hello! Everyone まもなく On Stage
Hello! Hello! Everyone, almost On Stage

211
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:43,436
Lie Life 自己暗示 さあ 始めよう
Lie Life, auto-suggestion; now, let's begin

212
00:16:57,436 --> 00:17:00,736
「ようこそ Party Night」 誰かが騙る
Someone falsely claims, "Welcome to Party Night"

213
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:04,736
連日満員御礼 どうぞ最贔屓に
House full every day; please, show your favoritism

214
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:08,036
「待ってた Show Time」 誰かが騙る
Someone falsely claims, "The Show Time you've been waiting for"

215
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:11,036
どうでもいいような顔を見せてよ
Show me a face that doesn't matter

216
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:12,736
ハブ、ご乱心、炎上
Hub, losing one's mind, flaming

217
00:17:12,736 --> 00:17:14,536
並べた嘘、一子相伝
Lined up lies, secret succession

218
00:17:14,536 --> 00:17:16,736
ふざけちゃいませんか?
Aren't we just fooling around?

219
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:21,036
今辿り着いた憧れの世界
The world of my dreams that I've finally reached

220
00:17:21,036 --> 00:17:24,636
ここはまるでペテン師の楽園
This place is just like a swindler's paradise

221
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:27,436
吐き気を飲み込む
Swallowing down the nausea

222
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:34,036
前座、幕が開けた オノマトペ
The opening act, the curtain rises; onomatopoeia

223
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:37,236
群がる人形はダリアの花束を
The swarming dolls carry bouquets of dahlias

224
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:40,536
本日、大団円 脚本が笑う
Today is the grand finale; the script is laughing

225
00:17:40,536 --> 00:17:44,036
騙されていてくれる貴方達と
With all of you who are willing to be deceived

226
00:17:44,036 --> 00:17:47,236
アタシ今ここで何をしてる?
What am I doing here right now?

227
00:18:01,736 --> 00:18:05,436
耳をつんざく 拍手喝采
Deafening applause and cheers

228
00:18:05,436 --> 00:18:08,436
サルもおだてればヒトにもなれる
Even a monkey can become human if flattered enough

229
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:10,336
フォーカスされた日常
A focused-upon daily life

230
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:14,436
引き金を引いて真実を射抜くように
Like pulling the trigger to pierce through the truth

231
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:18,236
一回、二回、三回、嘘を重ねて
Once, twice, three times, piling up the lies

232
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:22,436
十回、千回、億回、瞳を逸らして
Ten, a thousand, a hundred million times, averting my eyes

233
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:26,336
あれ? アタシは誰かな? アタシは...
Wait, who am I? I am...

234
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:28,236
アタシは誰?
Who am I?

235
00:18:28,436 --> 00:18:32,036
もうウンザリした仮面舞踏会
I'm sick of this masquerade ball

236
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:35,636
とりとめもないワルツでお出迎え
Greeting you with a rambling waltz

237
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:40,336
贋作の中 おどけてみせてよ
In this forgery, put on a funny show for me

238
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:42,736
嘲ってみせてよ
Show me your ridicule

239
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:48,736
アタシの世界は ぐるぐるぐるぐる 廻っていく
My world goes 'round and 'round and 'round

240
00:18:50,236 --> 00:18:53,436
前座、幕が開けた オノマトペ
The opening act, the curtain rises; onomatopoeia

241
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:57,136
群がる人形はダリアの花束を
The swarming dolls carry bouquets of dahlias

242
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,236
選んでくれた服を着て踊りましょう
Let's dance in the clothes you picked out for me

243
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:03,636
騙されていてくれる貴方達と
With all of you who are willing to be deceived

244
00:19:03,636 --> 00:19:06,736
いいよ、もう。これが好きだっただけだろ?
Fine, whatever. This is all you liked, isn't it?

245
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:22,936
振り落とせ ペルソナを
Shake off the persona

246
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:44,936
とっくに終わった 喜劇は悲劇と化してなお
Long since finished, the comedy turns into tragedy and yet

247
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:51,036
(今日も普通に楽しかったよ)
(I had a normal amount of fun today too)

248
00:19:51,636 --> 00:19:54,936
さあ刮目してくれよ
Now, keep your eyes peeled

249
00:19:55,236 --> 00:20:00,436
本当の僕は アタシじゃないから
Because the real me isn't 'her'

250
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:04,088
(今日も普通に楽しかったよ)
(Today was also fun as usual.)

251
00:20:10,938 --> 00:20:14,288
全力　幕が上がる　空想のオノマトペ
All out, the curtain rises. A fictional onomatopoeia.

252
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:17,588
着せ替え人形と　輪廻のアンコール
A dress-up doll and a samsara encore.

253
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:21,288
本日　大団円　客本位のお笑い
Today, the grand finale. Customer-centric comedy.

254
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,788
どうしようもないよな！？
It's helpless, right?!

255
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:26,588
あぁ、
Ah,

256
00:20:26,688 --> 00:20:30,688
どこの誰でもいい　「調子に乗るなよ」と　ただ一回言ってくれ
I don't care who it is. Just tell me "Don't get ahead of yourself" just once.

257
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:34,688
そういやユングも散々言ってたな
Come to think of it, Jung kept saying it over and over.

258
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:38,188
「もう後戻りは叶わない」と
That "There's no turning back now."

259
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:41,788
気付けばそこは独りきり
Before I knew it, I was all alone there.

260
00:21:20,888 --> 00:21:23,888
どうせフィクションの物語
Anyway, it's a fictional story.

261
00:21:35,288 --> 00:21:38,388
そ、どうせフィクションの物語だからね。
Right, because it's just a fictional story anyway.

262
00:21:38,788 --> 00:21:41,388
そう、フィクションだけに...
Right, because it's fiction...

263
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:42,688
...フィクション（ハクション）って！
...'Fiction' (Achoo)!

264
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:45,888
あはは、あはは。
Ahaha, ahaha.

265
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,388
ははっ、またおまる変なことしてる。
Haha, Omaru's doing weird things again.

266
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:50,688
ラミィ！
Lamy!

267
00:21:50,988 --> 00:21:53,388
はいはい、また遊びに行こうね。
Yeah yeah, let's go out together again.

268
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:57,388
お、う、ありがとう。ラミィだけだよそんなの。
Oh, uh, thanks. Only you'd say that, Lamy.

269
00:21:57,688 --> 00:21:58,288
え？
Eh?

270
00:21:58,388 --> 00:22:00,888
こよりはポルカ先輩のこと、大好きですよ！
Koyori loves you, Polka-senpai!

271
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:05,388
もっと自信持って！一緒にアイドル活動続けましょう！
Have more confidence! Let's continue our idol activities together!

272
00:22:05,988 --> 00:22:08,388
お、わかった。
Oh, I get it.

273
00:22:09,388 --> 00:22:13,188
二人がそう言ってくれるなら、私もうちょっと頑張れるかも。
If you two say so, I might be able to work a bit harder.

274
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:14,788
よし、
Alright,

275
00:22:14,888 --> 00:22:18,188
私は頑張って
I'll do my best

276
00:22:18,288 --> 00:22:22,888
変えていく、この世界を！
to change this world!

277
00:22:23,388 --> 00:22:25,888
決意
Determination

278
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:36,888
エヴァーブルー
Ever Blue

279
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:40,888
作詞/作曲 ぬゆり
Lyrics/Composition by nulut

280
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:59,388
太陽が地平線に飲み込まれるのを眺めていた
I was watching the sun being swallowed by the horizon.

281
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:08,388
まぶたを閉じれば
If I close my eyelids,

282
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:13,388
わたしも消えてしまえるような気がしたのに
I felt as if I could disappear too, and yet...

283
00:23:14,388 --> 00:23:16,888
くだらない白昼夢に終止符を打つ
Putting a full stop to the pointless daydream,

284
00:23:16,988 --> 00:23:18,888
生活の着信音
the ringtone of daily life.

285
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:21,888
馬鹿になった蛇口
A broken faucet,

286
00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:24,388
節制のない心　鏡は曇っている
an intemperate heart. The mirror is clouded.

287
00:23:24,888 --> 00:23:27,388
脱ぎ捨てた靴さえよそよそしい
Even the shoes I kicked off seem distant.

288
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:34,388
ここは底なしの海を
This is a bottomless sea.

289
00:23:34,888 --> 00:23:37,388
悲しくはない
I'm not sad.

290
00:23:39,888 --> 00:23:42,388
苦しくもない
I'm not in pain.

291
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:47,388
寂しくもない
I'm not lonely.

292
00:23:47,488 --> 00:23:50,388
悲しくない　苦しくない
I'm not sad, I'm not in pain,

293
00:23:50,488 --> 00:23:53,388
寂しくない　悲しくない　苦しくない　寂しくない
I'm not lonely, I'm not sad, I'm not in pain, I'm not lonely.

294
00:23:53,488 --> 00:23:54,888
あぁもううるさいな
Ah, enough already.

295
00:23:54,988 --> 00:23:57,388
うおぉぉ
Whoa...

296
00:23:57,488 --> 00:23:59,888
どこまでも沈む
Sinking forever.

297
00:24:00,388 --> 00:24:04,888
神さまでさえ見つけられないくらい
So deep that even God can't find me.

298
00:24:05,388 --> 00:24:10,388
深く深く深く沈んでいく
Sinking deeper, deeper, deeper.

299
00:24:10,888 --> 00:24:15,388
なまぬるいバスタブ
A lukewarm bathtub.

300
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:20,888
乾いたタイルに響くレクイエム
A requiem echoing on dry tiles.

301
00:24:21,388 --> 00:24:27,388
せかいがわたしだけを置いていく
The world is leaving only me behind.

302
00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:39,888
泡になってなくなってしまうなんて
Becoming bubbles and vanishing...

303
00:24:39,988 --> 00:24:42,688
美しい終わりはきっと来ない
such a beautiful ending will surely never come.

304
00:24:42,788 --> 00:24:45,088
魂ひとつすらままならないし
I can't even manage a single soul,

305
00:24:45,188 --> 00:24:47,388
せかいは不完全で果てがないもの
and the world is incomplete and boundless.

306
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:49,888
連れて張り付いた孤独が冷え切って
The clinging loneliness has chilled to the bone,

307
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,388
いつまでもわたしをがんじがらめにしている
and it keeps me bound hand and foot forever.

308
00:24:52,488 --> 00:24:54,888
この薄暗い部屋にたたずんで
Standing still in this dimly lit room,

309
00:24:54,988 --> 00:24:57,388
永遠の終わらせ方を知らないまま
without ever knowing how to end eternity.

310
00:24:57,488 --> 00:24:59,388
狙いでは夜光虫
By design, noctiluca.

311
00:24:59,488 --> 00:25:01,888
水面は遠く　静寂と赤信号
The surface is far away. Silence and a red light.

312
00:25:01,988 --> 00:25:04,388
ハイでショートしている　帰れないどこも
Shorted out while on a high. There's nowhere left to go back to.

313
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,200
揺らぎ続けている
Continuing to waver

314
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,700
さあ 時間だ
Now, it's time

315
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,400
かじかんだ身体が離れていく
My numbed body is drifting away

316
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,700
なにも感じたくない もう
I don't want to feel anything anymore

317
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,400
うお お お どこまでも落ちる
Whoa, falling forever

318
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,400
朝焼けでさえ照らしきれないように
So that even the sunrise cannot fully illuminate

319
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,900
昏く昏く溺れていく
Drowning deeper and deeper into the darkness

320
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,900
なまぬるい冷徹
Lukewarm cold-heartedness

321
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,400
1ドル銀貨の月さえ見放す
Even the one-dollar silver coin moon abandons me

322
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,100
エヴァーブルー 染まっては続くフューネラル
Ever Blue, the funeral continues as it's dyed

323
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,400
乾いた夜更けに燃えるレクイエム
A requiem burning in the parched late night

324
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:29,400
せかいがわたしだけを置いていく
The world is leaving me behind

325
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:56,900
そして、革命
And then, revolution

326
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,400

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,400
自由な時代だもん
It's a free era, after all

347
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
主張強めだった？
Was I too assertive?

348
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,400
意識高めだった？
Was I too high-conscious?

349
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,400
お天気次第とか言えない言い訳より
Rather than excuses like "it depends on the weather"

350
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,900
たのしい至上主義
The supremacy of fun

351

私の思うアイドル、見つけたよ。
I found the idol I envision.

447

舞台「尾丸ポルカ」〜あゝ素晴らしきアイドル人生かな〜
Stage "Omaru Polka" ~Ah, what a wonderful idol life~

Fin.

449
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:07,003
月の光が
The moonlight

450
00:37:07,903 --> 00:37:15,803
映し出したエピローグ
Reflected the epilogue

451
00:37:21,303 --> 00:37:26,803
屋根裏のエピローグ
Epilogue in the Attic

452
00:37:48,003 --> 00:37:51,803
静かに更ける夜に抱かれ
Embraced by the quietly deepening night

453
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:55,003
空に消える
Disappearing into the sky

454
00:37:55,103 --> 00:38:01,103
白い息 眺めた
I watched the white breath

455
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:05,603
夢のような時間はいつも
Dream-like time is always

456
00:38:05,703 --> 00:38:09,203
一瞬の
A fleeting

457
00:38:09,303 --> 00:38:15,403
煌めきでも
Sparkle, but still

458
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:19,603
とても大切なこと
It's something very important

459
00:38:19,703 --> 00:38:23,103
思い出に残して
Keep it in your memories

460
00:38:23,203 --> 00:38:29,303
私を今日(も)温めてくれる
It warms me even today

461
00:38:29,903 --> 00:38:35,203
流れ星に詰め込んだ願い事
Wishes packed into a falling star

462
00:38:36,303 --> 00:38:41,903
また明日 笑顔で会えますように
So that we can meet with a smile again tomorrow

463
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:48,803
閉じた瞼の裏で輝く
Shining behind closed eyelids

464
00:38:48,903 --> 00:38:54,103
あの景色抱いて 今日は
Embracing that scenery, today...

465
00:38:54,203 --> 00:38:57,803
おやすみ
Good night

466
00:39:15,903 --> 00:39:18,303
待ち遠しい夢の
The continuation

467

続きを
Of a long-awaited dream

468
00:39:21,603 --> 00:39:25,803
待ちきれない子供みたいに
Like a child who can't wait

469
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:35,203
下りた幕を背に眺めた星空
The starry sky I watched with the fallen curtain behind my back

470
00:39:36,303 --> 00:39:41,903
明日も輝いていたい
I want to be shining tomorrow too

471
00:39:43,003 --> 00:39:45,903
消えてゆく白熱灯
The incandescent light fading away

472
00:39:46,003 --> 00:39:49,103
眠りゆく街並み
The town falling asleep

473
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:55,803
愛しい終わりをこの目に映して
Reflecting the lovely ending in these eyes

474
00:39:56,103 --> 00:40:00,403
月明かりの差し込む
Where the moonlight shines in

475
00:40:01,755 --> 00:40:04,255
...眠れぬ夜で
...on sleepless nights,

476
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:08,255
いくつもの 場面 数え 微笑む
I count so many scenes and smile.

477
00:40:09,255 --> 00:40:13,255
ホログラムで できた夢
A dream made of holograms...

478
00:40:13,255 --> 00:40:17,255
目でも 確かに 触れる 想いで
...with feelings that I can surely see and touch.

479
00:40:17,755 --> 00:40:21,755
だから 流れ星に 詰めた 願い事
So, the wish I put into a shooting star,

480
00:40:22,755 --> 00:40:27,255
また ここで みんなで 歩めますように
is that we can all walk together here again.

481
00:40:28,255 --> 00:40:32,255
繋がってく 夢の途中
In the middle of a connecting dream,

482
00:40:32,755 --> 00:40:37,255
未来への 想いを なんて
holding onto feelings for the future,

483
00:40:37,255 --> 00:40:42,755
