流れてく涙の粒
the flowing teardrops.

11
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:09,548

Embraced without hesitation,

12

ぬくもりに出会った
I found warmth.

13
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:15,548
真っ白な雪のように
Like pure white snow,

どこまでも素直な言葉
words that are honest forever.

15
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:21,548
鉄の羽根まとった
Clad in iron wings,

僕を動かしてく
it moves me forward.

17
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:28,048

時を超え刻まれた
Carved across time,

23
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:46,548
悲しみの記憶
memories of sadness.

24
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:49,548

映し出す心の影
projecting the shadow of my heart.

33
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:33,048
寂しげに呟いた
Whispering lonely,

34
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:36,048
君のそばにいたい
"I want to be by your side."

35
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:39,048
真実と向き合うこと
Facing the truth,

36
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:42,048
教えてくれた勇気は
the courage you taught me

37
00:07:42,548 --> 00:07:45,048
僕を駆け巡って
runs through me,

38
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,048

触れ合う気持ち
Touching feelings,

40
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:55,048
離れないように
so they won't separate,

41
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:58,048
しっかりと抱きしめて
holding them tight.

42
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:01,048
確かな想い
Certain feelings,

43
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:04,048
貫いてゆく
piercing through.

銀の海に隠した
Hidden in the silver sea,

45
00:08:08,048 --> 00:08:10,548
空白のページ
a blank page.

46
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:13,548

Only you know,

47
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:17,048
本当の僕を見せて
show me the real me.

48

結んだ視線そらさずに
Without looking away from our gaze.

52
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:36,048
大切な今始める
Starting the precious 'now'.

53
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:09,548
君が君でいられる場所
The place where you can be yourself,

54
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:15,048
幻にさらわれぬように
so you won't be swept away by illusions.

やっと幕を下ろせた 最期の瞬間まで
Finally let the curtain fall, until the very last moment

638
00:51:18,115 --> 00:51:22,615
わたしは精一杯に わたしをやりきった
I gave it my all, I lived as myself to the fullest

639
00:51:26,615 --> 00:51:30,915
終演の続きは 誰も知らなくていい
No one needs to know what happens after the show ends

640
00:51:34,115 --> 00:51:38,315
涙を置いて 新しい旅に出よう
Leave the tears behind, let's set out on a new journey

641
00:51:40,915 --> 00:51:45,615
熱狂はあなたを選ぶ 違う結末だっただけ
The frenzy chooses you, it was just a different ending

642
00:51:49,615 --> 00:51:54,115
同じ愛になれなかった Destiny
We couldn't become the same love, Destiny

643
00:52:01,115 --> 00:52:05,615
これまでの全てを 差し出すような愛だった
It was a love where I offered up everything until now

644
00:52:08,615 --> 00:52:13,615
世界の意味が変わるくらいに 肯定された気がしたんだ
I felt affirmed enough to change the meaning of the world

645
00:52:16,915 --> 00:52:21,615
何気なさの中で 気づけた最初の奇跡が
The first miracle I realized amidst the casualness

646
00:52:24,315 --> 00:52:28,115
あなたでよかった わたしでよかった
I'm glad it was you, I'm glad it was me

647
00:52:28,115 --> 00:52:31,115
心から思えたよ
I could feel that from the bottom of my heart

648
00:52:41,915 --> 00:52:46,115
ずっと遠い未来も ちゃんと覚えていよう
Even in the far distant future, let's remember properly

649
00:52:49,615 --> 00:52:54,115
自分の抱きしめ方 明日の願いかた
How to embrace myself, how to wish for tomorrow

650
00:52:57,615 --> 00:53:01,615
あなたががいなくても わたしの片隅で
Even if you aren't here, in a corner of my heart

651
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:09,115
優しい光 消えたりしないとわかる
I know the gentle light won't vanish

652
00:53:11,315 --> 00:53:16,115
今はまだ手を振れるほど 道は別れたばかりで
Right now, we've only just parted ways, close enough to still wave

653
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:24,615
後ろ髪に風を感じながら
While feeling the wind on the back of my hair

654
00:53:32,115 --> 00:53:36,615
それまでの全てが あなたに出会うためだった
Everything until then was to meet you

655
00:53:39,915 --> 00:53:44,315
どの瞬間もムダじゃないこと 本当の意味で知れたから
Because I learned the true meaning that no moment was a waste

656
00:53:47,915 --> 00:53:52,115
次の曲がり角も 自分らしさで選べるはず
I should be able to choose the next turning point with my own style

657
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:59,115
いつかに繋がる 新しい一歩
A new step that connects to someday

658
00:53:59,115 --> 00:54:02,115
信じて歩き出そう
Let's believe and start walking

659
00:54:05,915 --> 00:54:10,615
心から誰かを愛せた あの日々は
Those days when I could love someone from my heart

660
00:54:13,115 --> 00:54:17,615
間違いなくわたしの Destiny Ah,
Were undoubtedly my Destiny, Ah,

661
00:54:28,115 --> 00:54:32,315
これまでの全てが 新しい力をくれる
Everything until now gives me new power

662
00:54:35,915 --> 00:54:40,615
どの瞬間もムダじゃないなら 何が起きても大丈夫だから
If no moment is wasted, then I'll be okay no matter what happens

663
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:49,915
次の物語も 自分らしさで選べるはず
I should be able to choose the next story with my own style too

664
00:54:53,315 --> 00:54:57,115
いつかに繋がる わたしのはじまり
My beginning that connects to someday

665
00:54:57,115 --> 00:55:00,615
信じて歩き出そう
Let's believe and start walking

666
00:55:00,763 --> 00:55:05,263
いつかに繋がる わたしのはじまり 信じて歩き出そう
Connecting to someday, my beginning. Believe and walk forward.

667
00:55:05,263 --> 00:55:08,963
再び幕は上がる
The curtain rises again.

668
00:55:25,663 --> 00:55:30,463
聴いていただいたのは、新曲の『STARTING OVER』でした！
What you just heard was my new song, "STARTING OVER"!

669
00:55:31,163 --> 00:55:35,063
はい、新年一発目、新曲の初披露ということで
Yes, first thing in the New Year, revealing a new song...

670
00:55:35,163 --> 00:55:38,363
ぬるっとね、新曲をやってしまったんですが
I just kind of casually performed a new song there.

671
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:44,963
平成感のある、懐かしみの感じの楽曲を歌わせていただいたんですけれども
I got to sing a song with a nostalgic Heisei-era vibe.

672
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:51,963
このあとこの曲が、24時から…あと数時間後か、24時からですね
After this, starting at midnight... just a few hours from now...

676
00:56:01,363 --> 00:56:05,263
そしてそして、もうMCがね、実は最後なので

ここまでが流れでございます
That was the planned flow.

688
00:56:40,963 --> 00:56:42,663
ずっと待ってたから
We were waiting the whole time.

689
00:56:42,963 --> 00:56:46,163
グッズをね、紹介させていただきたいと思います
I'd like to introduce the merchandise.

690
00:56:46,363 --> 00:56:49,963
なんか後ろで失礼ながらリアクションなどを各々取っていただいて
Please excuse me while they react in the background.

691
00:56:50,163 --> 00:56:51,663
ガヤすか
Are we the background noise?

692
00:56:51,763 --> 00:56:53,063
ガヤだガヤだ！
It's the peanut gallery!

693

あれ？なんかちょっと
Huh? Something's a little...

698
00:57:05,763 --> 00:57:09,663
あれ？あれ？あれ？
Huh? Huh? Huh?

699
00:57:10,163 --> 00:57:11,963
なんか盛ってます？
Are you padding it?

700
00:57:12,063 --> 00:57:13,363
盛ってませんよ！
I am not padding it!

701
00:57:14,663 --> 00:57:17,663
というわけで、まず一つ一つフォーカスしていきましょう
Anyway, let's focus on them one by one.

702
00:57:18,663 --> 00:57:20,163
まずはこちら！

00:57:28,763 --> 00:57:29,963
丸出しじゃないですか？
Isn't it all out in the open?

707
00:57:30,063 --> 00:57:31,663
それ部屋着だよー！
That's roomwear!

708
00:57:32,163 --> 00:57:34,663
部屋着って、だって寝る時だってこういう部屋着だろ！
Roomwear... I mean, you wear this kind of stuff to sleep, right?!

709
00:57:40,663 --> 00:57:43,163
人のチャンネルだからって言いたい放題しちゃって！
Saying whatever you want just because it's someone else's channel!

710
00:57:43,963 --> 00:57:45,963
お前シャツで寝たらしわ付くぞ！
If you sleep in a shirt, it'll get wrinkled!

711
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:49,163
写真撮影用かもしれないですもん！
It might be for a photoshoot!

712
00:57:51,163 --> 00:57:53,163
というわけで、初めて抱き枕カバー出します
