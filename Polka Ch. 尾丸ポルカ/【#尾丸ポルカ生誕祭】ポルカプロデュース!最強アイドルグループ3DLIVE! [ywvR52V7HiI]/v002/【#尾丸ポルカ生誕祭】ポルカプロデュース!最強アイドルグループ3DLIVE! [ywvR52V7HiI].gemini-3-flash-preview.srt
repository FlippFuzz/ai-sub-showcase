Left, right, anxiety circuits

150
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,945
A to Zに隙はない
There are no gaps from A to Z

151
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:53,945
至って　至って　選定EASY?
Completely, completely, is the selection EASY?

152
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:55,945
軽く言わないでよね
Don't say it so lightly

153
00:12:56,145 --> 00:12:58,445
僕は僕は都合もあるから
Because I have my own circumstances too

154
00:12:58,645 --> 00:12:59,945
とは言ってもそろそろOK
Having said that, it's almost OK

155
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:01,445
あのね　I like me
You know, I like me

156
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:03,645
は確定　意地っ子でも
is certain, even if I'm a stubborn child

157
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:06,845
I know meは言い切れない
I can't say for sure 'I know me'

158
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:09,345
ためらっても論より証拠
Even if I hesitate, proof is better than theory

159
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:13,245
悩んだ時間は自信に変換して
Convert the time spent worrying into confidence

160
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:17,645
耐えないで回ってく世界のいたずら
The world's pranks that keep spinning without ceasing

161
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:21,845
パラレルみたいに浮かんでくるひとりごと
Soliloquies that float up like parallel lines

162
00:13:22,145 --> 00:13:25,545
僕がいつかそうだ　大人になるまで
Until I eventually, that's right, become an adult

163
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:28,445
交わらなくたっていいでしょう
It's fine if we don't cross paths, right?

164
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:31,845
ほら一歩踏み出すタイミング狙い撃ち
Look, sniping the timing to take a step forward

165
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,845
願いを起動する呪文が必要なんです
I need a spell to activate my wishes

166
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:38,645
I want to changeぐらい言っちゃおうかな
Maybe I'll go ahead and say 'I want to change'

167
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:40,445
Yeah

168
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:43,645
飽きてる暇もないほど
To the point where there's no time to get bored

169
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:45,445
Yeah

170
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:48,545
奏でるよ　Pretty fever
I'll play it, Pretty fever

171
00:13:54,145 --> 00:13:55,345
I think so... ねえ
I think so... hey

172
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:57,945
このままじゃ完成度　上げられぬまま
If things stay like this, without being able to increase the quality

173
00:13:58,145 --> 00:14:00,345
Time goes on

174
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:02,845
そう　幻じゃないでしょう
Yes, it's not an illusion, is it?

175
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:05,345
わがまま　周りが認めてるプロフィール
Selfishness, a profile recognized by those around me

176
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,345
と目指す未来図の純粋度
And the purity of the future map I aim for

177
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:11,345
足して二で割って　そんぐらいは見逃して
Add them and divide by two, please overlook at least that much

178
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:14,345
クエスチョンマークが絡みつくわ
Question marks are entangling me

179
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:18,345
けどセルフィッシュさえも踊り出すわ
But even selfishness starts to dance

180
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:21,045
心天秤の裁きは決まってる
The judgment of my heart's scale is already decided

181
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:21,845
もう
Already

182
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:25,845
不器用に回ってる世界も好きだよ
I love this clumsily spinning world too

183
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:29,845
それでも器用に浮かんでくるひとりごと
Still, soliloquies that float up skillfully

184
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:31,445
困らせちゃうソーリー
Sorry for troubling you

185
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:33,445
でもでもずっとずっとシークレット
But but, it's a secret forever and ever

186
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:36,545
知ってなんていらない決まりです
It's a rule that I don't need you to know

187
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:39,445
驚かせちゃうほど大きい声で
With a voice loud enough to surprise you

188
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,845
Pretty fever

189
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:42,845
予想を上回って裏切っちゃって
Exceeding expectations and betraying them

190
00:14:43,145 --> 00:14:44,845
覚悟はいいですか
Are you ready?

191
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:45,945
I like me

192
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:49,045
絶対譲れないから
Because I absolutely won't back down

193
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:04,161
カレンダー
Calendar

194
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:07,798
日めくり
Daily flip

195
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:11,701
大人なアイツ
That adult-like person

196
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,475
期待かも
Maybe expectation

197
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:22,512
不安かも
Maybe anxiety

198
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:25,557
躊躇っても瞬時にWelcome
Even if I hesitate, instant welcome

199
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,557
そんなの自分で決めちゃっていいでしょ
It's okay to decide that yourself, right?

200
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,623
絶えないで変わってく世界のいたずら
A prank of a world that changes without ceasing

201
00:15:33,957 --> 00:15:37,394
パラレルみたいに浮かんでくるひとりごと
Soliloquies floating up like a parallel world

202
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:41,331
僕がいつかそばで大人になるまで
Until I grow up by your side someday

203
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:44,334
交じわなくたっていいでしょ
It's okay if they don't mix, right?

204
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:48,057
新しいPhaseにみんなを連れてくよ
I'll take everyone to a new phase

205
00:15:48,371 --> 00:15:52,342
自画自賛する自負が必要なんです
Pride in self-praise is necessary

206
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:55,812
I want to change 本気で言っちゃったから
I want to change, because I said it for real

207
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,757
いつでも青春 I can feel
Youth anytime, I can feel

208
00:16:00,757 --> 00:16:03,057
奏でるよ Pretty fever
Playing it, Pretty fever

209
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:05,057
Oh Pretty fever

210
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:29,557
わためお疲れ様！
Watame, good job!

211
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:31,557
あった、あった、あった！
Found it, found it, found it!

212
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,557
大丈夫、大丈夫です、行けるよ！
It's okay, it's okay, you can do it!

213
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:36,057
そんな不安そうな顔しないで！
Don't make such an anxious face!

214
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:39,057
頑張って！行ってらっしゃい！
Good luck! Have a good trip!

215
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:41,057
かっこよく決めちゃって！
Finish it coolly!

216
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:45,368
ねえ、聞こえてる？
Hey, can you hear me?

217
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:56,057
インモラリスト
Immoralist

218
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:56,057
作詞 / 作曲：清 竜人
Lyrics / Composition: Kiyoshi Ryujin

219
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:47,504
君と共にギリギリの愛
A love on the edge with you

220
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:49,506
赤裸々にミゼラブルな愛
A nakedly miserable love

221
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:51,508
ラブはいつもアナーキズムな愛
Love is always an anarchism love

222
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:56,079
私だけのインモラリストの愛
My own immoralist love

223
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,982
さよなら言えない
Can't say goodbye

224
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:01,885
わたしはダメだな
I'm no good

225
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:04,020
わからない
I don't know

226
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:05,422
わからない
I don't know

227
00:17:05,422 --> 00:17:07,524
自分がわからない
I don't know myself

228
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:10,594
この気持ち消えそうもない
This feeling doesn't seem like it'll fade

229
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:12,496
こんなにもなくならない
It won't disappear this much

230
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:17,567
いけないんだと思えば思うほど加速するの
The more I think I shouldn't, the more it accelerates

231
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:22,572
もう自分自身が怖いけど
I'm already scared of myself, but

232
00:17:23,773 --> 00:17:26,576
今信じてみるよ
I'll try believing now

233
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:30,580
何を失っても
No matter what I lose

234
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,583
きみの御許にと決めたの
I've decided to be by your side

235
00:17:37,087 --> 00:17:40,090
たとえ明日になれば
Even if tomorrow comes

236
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:45,595
消えゆく運命でも
Even if it's a fading fate

237
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:49,599
わたしを止める
Stopping me

238
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:55,605
理由にもならないよ
It won't even be a reason

239
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:58,608
わたしきみの前なら
If it's in front of you

240
00:17:58,608 --> 00:18:00,110
インモラリストだよ
I'm an immoralist

241
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:03,113
君と共にギリギリの愛
A love on the edge with you

242
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:05,615
赤裸々にミゼラブルな愛
A nakedly miserable love

243
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:07,617
ラブはいつもアナーキズムな愛
Love is always an anarchism love

244
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:11,621
私だけのインモラリストの愛
My own immoralist love

245
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:17,127
悲しみ 苦しみ 憎しみ おいでよ
Sadness, suffering, hatred, come here

246
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:22,632
わたしはいつでも迎える覚悟さ
I'm always prepared to welcome them

247
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:26,636
そんなふうに思えるようにもなったの
That I've come to feel that way

248
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:28,638
不思議だな
It's strange

249
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:30,640
出会ってくれてありがとう
Thank you for meeting me

250
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,643
わたし少し強くなれた
I've become a little stronger

251
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:36,646
涙なんて神様にあげるから
I'll give my tears to God, so

252
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:41,651
だからお願い自由をください
Please give me freedom

253
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:45,155
どこにでも行ける翼を
Wings that can go anywhere

254
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:51,661
たとえ叶うはずもない
Even if it shouldn't come true

255
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:56,666
何かに襲われても
Even if something attacks me

256
00:18:58,568 --> 00:19:01,171
今のわたしなら
If it's the current me

257
00:19:02,272 --> 00:19:06,176
一歩だって引かないよ
I won't back down even a single step

258
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:08,679
わたしきみの前なら
If it's in front of you

259
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:10,681
ヒロイックだよ
I'm heroic

260
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:20,591
愛したいのに
Even though I want to love

261
00:19:26,797 --> 00:19:30,601
苦しくて
It's painful

262
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:39,610
届け届け届いて...
Reach, reach, reach...

263
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,212
きみのこころに
To your heart

264
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:43,114
このわたしのインモラル
This immoral of mine

265
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:50,121
一人で抱えるには少し重すぎるの
It's a little too heavy to carry alone

266
00:19:51,122 --> 00:19:59,057
もういっそのことすべて捨ててしまおう
I might as well just throw everything away

267
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,469
なんて...
Saying...

268
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:04,269
...つぶやいて
...murmuring it as I go

269
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:08,769
眠るけど いつも
to sleep, but always,

270
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:16,894
きみの夢ばかり
all I do is dream of you.

271
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:18,069
どうして？わからない。
Why? I don't know.

272
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:20,569
なんで？なんでこんなに曲が難しいの？
Why? Why is this song so difficult?

273
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:23,569
ポルカプロデューサー、ポルカちゃん、
Polka Producer, Polka-chan,

274
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:26,619
助けてー！
Help me!

275
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:30,569
あー 答えなんて出なくても
Ah, even if the answer doesn't come out,

276
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:36,569
立ち向かうよ
I'll face it head-on!

277
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,069
さあこれも私の心体すべてが
Come, even this, my entire heart and body,

278
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:42,069
君と出会って導き出した答え
Is the answer derived from meeting you.

279
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:44,869
止まらない 止まれない 止まるつもりも
Won't stop, can't stop, no intention of stopping,

280
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,569
きみの御許にと決めたの
I've decided to be by your side.

281
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:50,069
きみのた今闘うの
I'm fighting for you right now.

282
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:54,569
だいすき
I love you.

283
00:20:57,569 --> 00:21:00,069
あいしてる
I love you.

284
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:05,569
たとえ明日になれば
Even if when tomorrow comes,

285
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:10,569
消えゆく運命でも
it's my fate to fade away,

286
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:16,069
わたしを止める
it won't be a reason

287
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:21,069
理由にもならないよ
to ever stop me.

288
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:24,069
わたしきみの前なら
If it's in front of you,

289
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:26,569
インモラリストだよ
I'm an immoralist.

290
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:29,069
君と共にギリギリのパイ
Right on the edge together with you,

291
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:31,569
あからさまにクラクラのパイ
Blatantly dizzy and lightheaded,

292
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:34,069
ラブはいつもアナーキズムのパイ
Love is always an anarchic struggle,

293
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:37,569
私だけのインモラルなパイ
My own personal immoral fight.

294
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:45,069
あくあ様～！ごめんね難しい曲振って！
Aqua-sama! Sorry for giving you such a hard song!

295
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:49,069
あくあ様、あくあ様は安定ですわ。
Aqua-sama, you were rock solid as always.

296
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:53,069
もうね、可愛くカッコよくビシッと決めちゃって
You were cute, cool, and you just nailed it!

297
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:56,069
くれました！
Great job!

298
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:14,069
お気に召すまま
As You Like It

299
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:29,869
淡々言葉を吐いた
I spoke my words indifferently

300
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:32,069
あんな思い出に泣いたのは
That I cried over those memories

301
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:34,569
今日で終わりにしないか
Why don't we end it today?

302
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:37,069
ワンツーの合図を待って
Waiting for the one-two signal

303
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:39,569
ユーエンミー手を取り合ったのは
You and me holding hands

304
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:42,069
僕の勇気ある行動
Was my courageous action

305
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,569
立ち止まらないでいいんだからね
It's okay not to stop

306
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:48,569
空々しいなこの人生
This life is so hollow

307
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:51,569
できないだなんて言わないでね
Please don't say you can't do it

308
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:53,569
言わないでね
Don't say it

309
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:02,069
今更なんて言わないでね
Don't say it's too late now

310
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:10,569
僕ら今 さあさあ輪になって回り始める
We're starting to go 'round in a circle now

311
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:14,569
だんだん嫌になってでも好きになる
Gradually growing tired of it, yet loving it

312
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:17,569
ねえねえわかんないや自分会議も
Hey, hey, I don't get it, even this inner debate

313
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:21,069
どんどん中寄ってでも離れてく
Drawing closer together, yet drifting apart

314
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:24,569
パッパ音に乗って踊り始める
Moving to the beat and starting to dance

315
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,069
散々嫌になってでも好きになる
Grown weary of it, yet still loving it

316
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:31,069
ねえねえわかんないやこの先ずっと
Hey, hey, I won't understand, from now on

317
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:34,569
僕の心をシェイクシェイクイェイ
Shake shake my heart, yeah!

318
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:38,869
正解なんてないのさ
There's no such thing as a correct answer

319
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:43,069
じゃあ一体どこに向かえば物語は終わりますか
Then where should we head for this story to end?

320
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:46,069
ワンツーの合図を待って
Waiting for the one-two signal

321
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:48,569
ユーエンミー手が触れ合ったのは
You and me, our hands touching

322
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:51,069
僕の勇気ある行動
Was my courageous action

323
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:54,069
畏まったって意味ないんだって
There's no point in being so formal

324
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:57,069
恥ずかしがった夢にバイバイです
Say goodbye to those shy dreams

325
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,069
この先ずっとよろしくね
From now on, let's stick together

326
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:02,069
よろしくね
Let's stick together

327
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:06,569
君と今 さあさあ交わって目を逸らしあう
You and I, crossing paths and looking away

328
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:10,069
だんだん嫌になってでも好きになる
Gradually growing tired of it, yet loving it

329
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:13,069
ねえねえわかんないや自分会議も
Hey, hey, I don't get it, even this inner debate

330
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:16,569
どんどん様になって崩れ落ちてく
Taking shape, then crumbling away

331
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:20,069
パッパ触れる前に消えてしまうの
It vanishes before I can even touch it

332
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:23,569
散々嫌になってでも好きになる
Grown weary of it, yet still loving it

333
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:26,569
ねえねえわかんないやこの先ずっと
Hey, hey, I won't understand, from now on

334
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:30,069
わかりあえるまで僕たちは
Until we can truly understand each other

335
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:51,069
今更なんて言わないでね
Don't say it's too late now

336
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,114
踊り始める
Start to dance

337
00:25:01,114 --> 00:25:02,481
段々嫌になって
Getting more and more sick of it

338
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:03,814
でも好きになる
But I end up liking it

339
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:05,281
ねえねえ わかんないや
Hey, hey, I just don't know

340
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:06,814
自分会議も
Even the meeting in my head

341
00:25:06,814 --> 00:25:08,314
どんどん中に寄って
Gathers more and more inside

342
00:25:08,314 --> 00:25:09,881
でも離れてく
But then it drifts away

343
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:11,247
ぱっぱ 音に乗って
Pa-pa, riding the sound

344
00:25:11,247 --> 00:25:12,547
踊り始める
Start to dance

345
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:13,881
散々嫌になって
Getting completely sick of it

346
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:15,181
でも好きになる
But I end up liking it

347
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,714
ねえねえ わかんないや
Hey, hey, I just don't know

348
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:18,047
この先もずっと
From now on and forever

349
00:25:18,047 --> 00:25:22,581
僕の心を シェイク シェイク イェーイ
Shake, shake, yeah! My heart

350
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:13,481
皆様、お疲れ様です！お次はみこち、
Good work, everyone! Next up is Miko-chi!

351
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:16,881
みこちの番でもうズギャッてね、
It's Miko-chi's turn to just go "zgya!"

352
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:21,281
異世界ムーブ始まっちゃったらそこも全然楽しんじゃって！
Once the other-world move starts, just enjoy the whole thing!

353
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:24,481
それではみこち、最初の盛り上げ役よろしく！
Now Miko-chi, take it away as the first hype-builder!

354
00:26:27,581 --> 00:26:30,881
パッパッパラッパ パッパッパラッパ
Pa-pa-pa-ra-pa, pa-pa-pa-ra-pa

355
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:34,581
パッパッパラッパ パッパッパラッパ...
Pa-pa-pa-ra-pa, pa-pa-pa-ra-pa...

作詞：きみコ 作曲：佐々木淳
Lyrics: kimiko / Composition: Jun Sasaki

358
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:47,881
目が覚めたなら
If I wake up

359
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:50,481
君が笑って
and you are smiling

360
00:26:50,481 --> 00:26:53,381
そんな世界が続くと思ってた
I thought that kind of world would continue

361
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,781
当たり前には少し足りない
It's a little lacking in normality

362
00:26:58,781 --> 00:27:02,581
歪んだ視界から見てた
Looking through a distorted field of vision

363
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:05,181
青い夜
at the blue night

364
00:27:05,181 --> 00:27:08,281
何度目の朝で
In which morning was it?

365
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:11,081
打ち明けた恋のように
Like a love that was confessed

366
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:13,981
少し酸っぱいままで出かけたなら
If I went out while it was still a little sour

367
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:18,081
近付いてく ぼくらデリケート
Getting closer, we are delicate

368
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:20,981
淡い夢を見せてあげよう
Let me show you a faint dream

369
00:27:20,981 --> 00:27:24,881
たまにはいいことあるかも
Maybe something good will happen once in a while

370
00:27:24,881 --> 00:27:27,481
ご褒美にはチョコレート
For a reward, some chocolate

371
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:30,081
甘い夢を見れたら
If I could have a sweet dream

372
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,481
それがすべてだなんて
saying "that's everything"

373
00:27:32,481 --> 00:27:35,181
笑い飛ばそう
let's laugh it off

374
00:27:35,381 --> 00:27:37,981
あいまいだって
Even if it's vague

375
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:40,481
だいたいだって
Even if it's mostly so

376
00:27:40,481 --> 00:27:44,281
続く気がして夜空をあおいだ
I felt like it would continue and looked up at the night sky

377
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:48,981
なんとなくかな
Maybe just because

378
00:27:48,981 --> 00:27:51,581
見えた景色が
the scenery I saw

379
00:27:51,581 --> 00:27:54,381
新しい世界へ ほらね
To a new world, look

380
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,281
導くよ
it'll guide you

381
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:58,881
回り続ける
Keep on turning

382
00:27:58,881 --> 00:28:01,381
この星はだれのもの？
Who does this planet belong to?

383
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:04,281
難しい話なら食後にして
If it's a difficult topic, save it for after dinner

384
00:28:32,381 --> 00:28:35,781
パッパッパラッパ パッパッパラッパ
Pa-pa-pa-ra-pa, pa-pa-pa-ra-pa

385
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:39,381
パッパッパラッパ パッパッパラッパ...
Pa-pa-pa-ra-pa, pa-pa-pa-ra-pa...

386
00:28:40,481 --> 00:28:43,081
近付いてく ぼくらデリケート
Getting closer, we are delicate

387
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:45,981
淡い夢を見せてあげよう
Let me show you a faint dream

388
00:28:45,981 --> 00:28:49,781
たまにはいいことあるかも
Maybe something good will happen once in a while

389
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:52,481
ご褒美にはチョコレート
For a reward, some chocolate

390
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,981
甘い夢を見れたら
If I could have a sweet dream

391
00:28:54,981 --> 00:28:57,481
それがすべてだなんて
saying "that's everything"

392
00:28:57,481 --> 00:29:00,281
笑い飛ばそう
let's laugh it off

393
00:29:00,481 --> 00:29:03,081
あの角でスパスパストレート
A straight puff at that corner

394
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:05,481
見えないフリしたかった
I wanted to pretend I didn't see it

395
00:29:05,481 --> 00:29:08,381
向き合えば聞こえた
If I faced it, I could hear it

396
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:10,581
手招きする声
A beckoning voice

397
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:13,481
いくつかのバリケード
Several barricades

398
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:15,581
交わせ
Evade them

399
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:18,481
知れば知るほど
The more I know

400
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:20,481
分からなくもなるくらい
the more I don't understand

401
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:22,581
不思議な世界
a mysterious world

402
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:03,193
手と手 目と目 ひとりとひとり 出会って

もっともっと熱い ステージへ!
To an even hotter stage!

457
00:32:51,193 --> 00:32:53,259
Come on, everybody 地平線まで
Come on, everybody, to the horizon

458
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:56,659
スタートからゴールまで 愛のファンファーレ 鳴らせ!
From start to finish, sound the fanfare of love!

459
00:32:56,693 --> 00:32:59,126
どんなハチャメチャ 待ってても
No matter what craziness awaits

460
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,493
後悔先に 立たず
It's no use crying over spilled milk

461
00:33:01,526 --> 00:33:06,426
願い続け ていれば リアルになる いつかは
If you keep wishing, it will become real someday

462
00:33:06,459 --> 00:33:08,659
そんじゃ、いくぜ! BIG BANG!
Alright, let's go! BIG BANG!

463
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:12,259
手と手 目と目 ひとりとひとり 出会って
Hand to hand, eye to eye, one person and another met

464
00:33:12,293 --> 00:33:14,459
ふたりになる You & Me
And became two, you & me

465
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,159
昨日じゃないって それだけで
Just the fact that it's not yesterday

466
00:33:17,193 --> 00:33:20,693
Good morning, Good morning 始まりでしょ
Good morning, Good morning, it's the beginning, right?

467
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:24,259
夜が朝に 季節が花に 出会って
Night meets morning, seasons meet flowers

468
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,559
未来になる You & Me (With the beat!)
And become the future, you & me (With the beat!)

469
00:33:26,593 --> 00:33:30,093
愛よりもっと ラブな笑顔で
With a smile more 'love' than love itself

470
00:33:30,126 --> 00:33:35,393
終わんない HAPPY DANCE
A never-ending happy dance

471
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:38,293
Lucky, Lucky, Love! You & Me!

472

Life goes on 満足してた
Life goes on, I was satisfied

491
00:34:40,226 --> 00:34:43,759
少しの希望だけで
With just a little bit of hope

492
00:34:43,793 --> 00:34:47,259
待ってれば 誰かが未来 決めてくれていた
If I waited, someone else would decide the future for me

493
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,093
Just get it back Your back Pick it back up!

494

なんて小さい自分なんだろう? Bust it up!
How small of a person am I? Bust it up!

495
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:56,659
Here we go! One, two!

今すぐ夢まで走ろう
Let's run to our dreams right now

498
00:35:02,405 --> 00:35:03,605
Vive la revolution!

499
00:35:03,605 --> 00:35:04,305
Let's go!

500
00:35:04,305 --> 00:35:05,205
Let's go!

501
00:35:05,505 --> 00:35:08,805
Gamble, you gotta chance to make a Rumble

502
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:11,005
ギリギリのステージ
On the edge of the stage

503
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:12,205
Oh yeah

504
00:35:12,205 --> 00:35:15,405
Gamble, you gotta dive into the scramble

505
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,705
1ミリも迷わず
Without a moment's hesitation

506
00:35:18,505 --> 00:35:23,205
守るべきモノなんて 実はそんなに無い
There really aren't that many things I should protect

507
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:29,005
少しだけ強がって 賭けましょう全部
Let's pretend to be a little tough and bet it all

508
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:30,405
Play the game

509
00:35:56,305 --> 00:36:02,205
暴挙、自分だし、視線を削って過ごしていた
Recklessness, it was me, spending time cutting through glances

510
00:36:02,605 --> 00:36:08,605
代償に手に入れたのは古臭いモラル
What I got in exchange was an old-fashioned moral

511
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:13,605
臆病なこの群れから今バスタ
Leaving this cowardly herd now

512
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:21,105
何も持ってないで 飛び出そう
Let's jump out with nothing

513
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:26,605
Gamble, you gotta chance to make a Rumble

514
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:29,105
研ぎ澄まされていく
Becoming sharpened

515
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:30,205
Oh yeah

516
00:36:30,205 --> 00:36:33,305
Gamble, you gotta dive into the scramble

517
00:36:33,305 --> 00:36:35,405
直感を信じて
Trusting my intuition

518
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:40,905
本命の君の愛 以外はいらなくて
I don't need anything other than your true love

519
00:36:42,205 --> 00:36:46,805
少しでも迷うもの 捨てましょう
Let's throw away everything that makes us hesitate, even a little

520
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,505
It's gonna feel so bad

521
00:37:13,705 --> 00:37:17,105
Gamble, you gotta chance to make a Rumble

522
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:19,405
溢れ出す目眩が
The overflowing dizziness is...

523
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:22,605
Gamble, you gotta dive into a scramble!

524
00:37:22,605 --> 00:37:25,905
弾けそうなラストゲーム
Like a last game about to burst

525
00:37:25,905 --> 00:37:29,105
Gamble, you gotta chance to make a Rumble

526
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:31,305
ギリギリのステージ
On the edge of the stage

527
00:37:31,305 --> 00:37:32,505
Oh yeah

528
00:37:32,505 --> 00:37:35,605
Gamble, you gotta dive into the scramble

529
00:37:35,605 --> 00:37:38,105
1ミリも迷わず
Without a moment's hesitation

530
00:37:38,805 --> 00:37:43,605
一瞬の選択で すべてを失くしても
Even if I lose everything in a moment's choice

531
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:49,305
後悔は見せないで 明るく負けて泣きましょう
Don't show regret, let's lose cheerfully and cry

532
00:38:14,405 --> 00:38:17,605
Bring back yo, it's the right time, hey boy rock'n roll

533
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:29,105
3, 2, 1, Break down!

534
00:38:29,105 --> 00:38:32,105
ez do dance

535
00:38:29,105 --> 00:38:32,105
作詞/作曲 小室哲哉
Lyrics/Composition: Tetsuya Komuro

536
00:39:09,405 --> 00:39:13,305
I can hear my voice 今 始まる
I can hear my voice, it's starting now

537
00:39:13,305 --> 00:39:16,505
Midnight time から この場所で
From midnight time, at this place

538
00:39:16,905 --> 00:39:23,505
行くあてが同じ仲間と すべての嘘脱ぎ去る
With friends heading to the same destination, taking off all lies

539
00:39:24,105 --> 00:39:30,105
何もなくて道もなくて 踊る君はどこから
With nothing and no road, where are you dancing from?

540
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:36,605
逃げているのさ 行くのさ 不思議なほどまぶしい
Running away, going, it's mysteriously bright

541
00:39:37,405 --> 00:39:44,305
誘う夢 語り合って 絆なめ合ってるだけだし
Talking about the inviting dreams, just licking each other's bonds

542
00:39:44,305 --> 00:39:50,205
Easy go easy go 笑顔だけ ひとときの輪をつなぐよ
Easy go easy go, only smiles connect the wheel for a moment

543
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:04,317
I've got a feeling 抜け出していく 街が目覚めるころ
I've got a feeling, as I break away just as the city wakes up.

544
00:40:04,717 --> 00:40:10,617
朝焼けに口づけてる 波も抱きしめている
Kissing the morning glow, embracing the waves as well.

545
00:40:10,917 --> 00:40:14,417
Ez Do Dance Ez Do Dance 踊る君を見てる
Ez Do Dance, Ez Do Dance, I'm watching you dance.

546
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:17,917

Ez Do Dance Ez Do Dance 君だけを見ている
Ez Do Dance, Ez Do Dance, I'm looking only at you.

549
00:40:39,217 --> 00:40:45,417
欲しいものはいつだって 不意に遭遇する
The things I want, I always encounter them unexpectedly.

550
00:40:46,117 --> 00:40:52,417
見えない明日 突然に 巡り合えるときめき
The invisible tomorrow, the excitement of a sudden encounter.

551
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:59,417
午前5時 永遠の ルール変わる瞬間
5 AM, the moment the eternal rules change.

552
00:41:00,217 --> 00:41:05,517
きっと愛なんて 呼べるものじゃないけど
It's surely not something you could call love, but...

553
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:19,417
I've got a feeling 抜け出していく 街が目覚めるころ
I've got a feeling, as I break away just as the city wakes up.

554
00:41:19,817 --> 00:41:26,217
朝焼けに口づけてる 波も抱きしめている
Kissing the morning glow, embracing the waves as well.

560
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:54,317
Yo! Yeah! Yeah! Oh! Come on!

561
00:41:54,317 --> 00:41:57,717
I like that, I guess, Keep up the beat like it

562
00:41:57,717 --> 00:42:01,417
Jack Black, all the night, so happy, so yeah!

563
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:05,217
Get moving, my joiners, shake your body, shake everybody

564
00:42:05,217 --> 00:42:08,117
体の芯まで感じる瞬間 時間の壁まで弾けるリズム
The moment you feel it to your core, a rhythm that bursts through the wall of time.

565
00:42:08,417 --> 00:42:14,617
I've got a feeling 抜け出していく 街が目覚めるころ
I've got a feeling, as I break away just as the city wakes up.

566
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:21,417
朝焼けに口づけてる 波も抱きしめている
Kissing the morning glow, embracing the waves as well.

567
00:42:22,117 --> 00:42:25,417
Ez Do Dance Ez Do Dance 踊る君を見てる

571
00:42:36,117 --> 00:42:42,617

I've got a feeling, as I break away just as the city wakes up.

572
00:42:43,117 --> 00:42:50,117
朝焼けに口づけてる... Thank you Towa-sama! Yeah!
Kissing the morning glow... Thank you, Towa-sama! Yeah!

573
00:42:56,917 --> 00:42:59,917
さあ、そしてDJタイムが終わりまーした！
Now then, the DJ time has come to an end!

574
00:43:00,117 --> 00:43:04,317
次は誰かな？おっ、フレア！じゃあポルカは客席側に移るわ！
Who's next? Oh, Flare! Then Polka will move over to the audience side!

575
00:43:05,217 --> 00:43:08,617
後で、ちょっと3人曲あるから、その時はまたよろしくー！
Later on, there's a song for the three of us, so I'll see you then!

576
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:18,617
おねだりしてみてほしいの
I want you to try begging me.

577
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:32,417
おねだりフレアちゃーん！
Onegai Flare-chan!

578
00:43:32,617 --> 00:43:36,617
ダーリン あなたは私の言うこと全然聞かない
Darling, you don't listen to anything I say at all.

579
00:43:36,617 --> 00:43:42,617
あれほどやめてと言ったタバコもお酒も 毎日二箱七回一日たりとも欠かさず
The cigarettes and alcohol I told you so much to quit, two packs and seven drinks every single day without fail.

580
00:43:42,617 --> 00:43:48,117
肝臓やられてお釈迦になっても 看病してあげないんだから
Even if your liver gives out and you kick the bucket, I'm not going to nurse you.

581
00:43:48,117 --> 00:43:53,117
あーやこーや言うこと聞かない あなたのハートは真っ黒です
Your heart that won't listen to this or that is pitch black.

582
00:43:54,117 --> 00:43:57,917
言いたいことは言わないし
You don't say what you want to say.

583
00:43:58,117 --> 00:44:03,117
行きたいとこからやりたいことまで決めてるくせにたまりま専務
Even though you've decided everything from where you want to go to what you want to do, I can't stand it.

584
00:44:04,217 --> 00:44:08,617
ねえ そんなの馬鹿みたいじゃない そうじゃない じゃない じゃない
Hey, isn't that just stupid? That's not it, not it, not it.

585
00:44:08,917 --> 00:44:13,117
言いたいことがあるならパッと言えば？
If you have something to say, why don't you just say it?

586
00:44:14,417 --> 00:44:18,617
いつも思わせぶりな感じで 察してほしい感じで
Always acting suggestive, acting like you want me to guess.

587
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:23,117
わざと口にしないのずるくない？ 馬鹿じゃないの？
Isn't it unfair that you purposely don't say it? Are you stupid?

588
00:44:24,117 --> 00:44:29,117
お願いダーリン 見て聞いて 欲しいのは形のないもの
Please, darling, look and listen. What I want is something without a form.

589
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:34,417
馬鹿にしないで 見て聞いて 覗いてよ瞳の奥の方
Don't make fun of me, look and listen. Take a peek into the depths of my eyes.

590
00:44:35,117 --> 00:44:42,117
まっすぐ見つめて おねだりしてみてほしいの
Look straight at me. I want you to try begging me.

591
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:50,917
ダーリン 私はあなたの気持ちを全然知らないわ
Darling, I don't know your feelings at all.

592
00:44:51,117 --> 00:44:56,417
あれほど熱心に見つめてきたのに今ではすっかり知らんぷり
Even though you looked at me so intently, now you're completely playing dumb.

593
00:44:56,617 --> 00:45:01,117
ていうかそれって胡座をかいてるだけなんじゃないですか？
I mean, aren't you just resting on your laurels?

594
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:07,617
ぶっちゃけ下先三寸あなたのせいで私のハートはボロボロです
To be honest, because of your glib tongue, my heart is in tatters.

595
00:45:08,117 --> 00:45:12,417
つれない時はつれないし
When you're cold, you're cold.

596
00:45:12,617 --> 00:45:17,417
そっちがなかなか言い出さないからいつも私が舵取り専門
Since you won't speak up, I'm always the one taking the lead.

597
00:45:18,417 --> 00:45:22,617
ねえ なんだか馬鹿みたいじゃない そうじゃない じゃない じゃない
Hey, doesn't it feel a bit stupid? That's not it, not it, not it.

598
00:45:23,117 --> 00:45:27,617
こんなことさせてちゃダメ出し
I can't let you keep doing this.

599
00:45:28,217 --> 00:45:32,417
どこか足元見てる感じで 値踏みされてる感じで
Feeling like you're taking advantage of me, like you're appraising me.

600
00:45:32,617 --> 00:45:37,117
駆け引きやら勝ち負けじゃなくない？
Isn't it not about tactics or winning and losing?

601
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:42,417
そういう面倒くさいことしてるから面倒くさい
It's annoying because you're doing such annoying things.

602
00:45:01,962 --> 00:45:03,295
寡黙なダーリンねえ聞いて
Taciturn Darling, hey, listen

603
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:05,729
切なさは飾りじゃないのよ
Sadness isn't just for show

604
00:45:05,862 --> 00:45:08,262
よそ見しないで 逃げないで
Don't look away, don't run away

605
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:11,295
触ってよ 心の奥の方
Touch me, deep in my heart

606
00:45:11,462 --> 00:45:13,262
一瞬のことじゃない
It's not just for a moment

607
00:45:13,395 --> 00:45:14,362
せーの！
Ready, go!

608
00:45:14,362 --> 00:45:16,962
おねだりしてみてはくれないの？
Won't you try begging for me?

609
00:45:22,129 --> 00:45:24,129
ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！
Hai! Hai! Hai! Hai!

610
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:29,562
言葉にできない臆病さは
This cowardice I can't put into words

611
00:45:29,762 --> 00:45:32,529
したたかさではないのよ
Isn't a sign of toughness

612
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:33,329
ホントそれな！
So true!

613
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:35,929
甘えてないで 口に出してよ
Don't be spoiled, say it out loud

614
00:45:35,929 --> 00:45:38,395
もう ちゃんとこっち向いてったら！
Geez, look this way properly!

615
00:45:38,395 --> 00:45:39,229
ハイ！
Hai!

616
00:45:39,229 --> 00:45:41,929
お願いダーリン見て聞いて
Please, Darling, look and listen

617
00:45:41,929 --> 00:45:44,329
欲しいのは形のないもの
What I want is something without a form

618
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:45,129
よっほー！
Yoo-hoo!

619
00:45:45,129 --> 00:45:47,495
馬鹿にしないで見て聞いて
Don't make fun of me, look and listen

620
00:45:47,595 --> 00:45:50,295
覗いてよ 瞳の奥の方
Peer into the depths of my eyes

621
00:45:50,295 --> 00:45:51,129
ハイ！
Hai!

622
00:45:51,129 --> 00:45:53,729
寡黙なダーリン 寝てないで
Taciturn Darling, don't be asleep

623
00:45:53,762 --> 00:45:55,829
暴いてよ 私の素顔を
Expose my true face

624
00:45:55,862 --> 00:45:58,329
お願いダーリン そばにいて
Please, Darling, stay by my side

625
00:45:58,362 --> 00:46:00,829
触らせて 心の奥の方
Let me feel deep in my heart

626
00:46:00,862 --> 00:46:01,662
ハイ！
Hai!

627
00:46:01,662 --> 00:46:03,329
真っ直ぐ見つめて
Stare straight at me

628
00:46:03,362 --> 00:46:05,929
おねだりしてみてほしいの
I want you to try begging for me

629
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,629
オー！
Oh!

630
00:46:08,629 --> 00:46:10,362
ワーイ！
Yay!

631
00:46:23,362 --> 00:46:24,629
お願いダーリン
Please, Darling

632
00:46:24,629 --> 00:46:26,629
かわいい！
So cute!

633
00:46:29,529 --> 00:46:31,129
せーの！ 1 2 3 はい！
Ready? 1 2 3 go!

634
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:36,629
ぽん！
Pon!

635
00:46:36,629 --> 00:46:42,629
はっはっはっはっはっはいや
Ha ha ha ha ha ha iya...

636
00:46:42,629 --> 00:46:45,429
これよりご覧いただきますのは
傾奇者たちの栄枯盛衰
What you are about to see
is the rise and fall of the eccentrics

637
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:48,429
時代は常に日進月歩
付いてってよ 老若男女
Times are always progressing rapidly
Keep up, everyone, young and old

638
00:46:49,729 --> 00:46:52,329
一見は勧善懲悪 悪者どもを一刀両断
At a glance, rewarding good and punishing evil,
cutting down the wicked in one stroke

639
00:46:52,329 --> 00:46:54,729
でもホントにそれだけで楽しいの？
But is that really all that's fun?

640
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,129
もうなんだって こんにゃく問答
Whatever it is, it's a nonsensical dialogue

641
00:46:57,129 --> 00:47:02,429
はっはっはっはっはっはいや ぽん！
Ha ha ha ha ha ha iya pon!

642
00:47:02,429 --> 00:47:05,229
どこからともなく現れて
すぐどこか行っちゃって神出鬼没
Appearing out of nowhere and
disappearing instantly, ever-elusive

643
00:47:05,229 --> 00:47:08,429
チャンスを待ったら一日千秋
追いかければ東奔西走
Waiting for a chance feels like an eternity,
chasing after it leads all over the place

644
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:11,629
時代は常に千変万化 人の心は複雑怪奇
Times are always ever-changing,
the human heart is complex and mysterious

645
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:14,129
でも本気でそんなこと言ってんの？
But are you really serious about that?

646
00:47:14,129 --> 00:47:16,329
もうどうにも満身創痍
Now completely covered in wounds

647
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:18,629
ああ 巡り巡って
Ah, going round and round

648
00:47:18,629 --> 00:47:21,429
夜の街
The night streets

649
00:47:22,129 --> 00:47:24,129
キミは 合図出し
You give the signal

650
00:47:24,129 --> 00:47:27,629
踊りだす
And start to dance

651
00:47:28,329 --> 00:47:30,929
回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ！
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin!

652
00:47:30,929 --> 00:47:33,629
華麗に花弁 散らすように
Magnificently, like scattering flower petals

653
00:47:33,629 --> 00:47:36,529
回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ！
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin!

654
00:47:36,529 --> 00:47:38,929
髪も振り乱して
With hair flying wildly

655
00:47:38,929 --> 00:47:40,529
一昨日、昨日
The day before yesterday, yesterday

656
00:47:40,529 --> 00:47:43,129
今日と、明日と、明後日と
Today, and tomorrow, and the day after

657
00:47:43,129 --> 00:47:45,129
この宴は続く
This banquet continues

658
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:47,429
踊レ、歌エ、一心不乱に回レ！
Dance, sing, spin with all your heart!

659
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:48,429
一心不乱に回レ！
Spin with all your heart!

660
00:47:48,429 --> 00:47:51,629
今宵は雪月花
Tonight is the Snow, Moon, and Flowers

661
00:48:04,129 --> 00:48:07,129
この世に平安訪れるの？
のべつ幕無し丁々発止
Will peace ever visit this world?
A continuous, heated exchange

662
00:48:07,129 --> 00:48:10,129
兵ども千客万来 ひしめき合う群雄割拠
Warriors coming in crowds, a struggle for supremacy

663
00:48:10,129 --> 00:48:12,829
伸るか反るか一攫千金
気が付いたら絶体絶命
Sink or swim, a sudden fortune
Before you know it, a desperate situation

664
00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:15,429
でも本音のとこ、どうなってんの？
But deep down, what's really going on?

665
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:17,729
もうまったく奇想天外
Simply fantastic and unexpected

666
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:20,329
ああ たどりたどって
Ah, tracing and tracing

667
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:23,129
夜の街
The night streets

668
00:48:24,129 --> 00:48:26,429
迷い 一つなく
Without a single hesitation

669
00:48:26,429 --> 00:48:29,129
踊りだす
Start to dance

670
00:48:29,129 --> 00:48:32,529
回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ！
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin!

671
00:48:32,529 --> 00:48:35,429
華麗に花弁 散らすように
Magnificently, like scattering flower petals

672
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:38,329
回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ回レ！
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin!

673
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:40,929
髪も振り乱して
With hair flying wildly

今宵は雪月花
Tonight is the Snow, Moon, and Flowers

680
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:19,429
花で一つ、鳥で二つ
One for the flowers, two for the birds

681
00:49:19,429 --> 00:49:22,629
手打ち鳴らす
Clap your hands

I'm so happy that so many of my friends came!

709
00:50:54,241 --> 00:50:57,141
語彙が無くなっちゃった！あははは！
I've run out of words! Ahahaha!

710
00:50:57,241 --> 00:51:02,141
それでもみんなが横に居るからポルカは頑張っていられます！
But because everyone is by my side, Polka can keep doing her best!

711
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:06,141
ありがとうございます！そしてまた次の誕生日、これからもよろしくね！

準備はできてますか？行くぜ！Are you ready?
Are you ready? Let's go! Are you ready?

713
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:14,141
さあさあ近くにおいで　きっと誰もが仰天
Come, come, come closer. Surely everyone will be amazed.

714
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:17,641
奇想天外なショーの始まりさ
It's the start of a fantastic show.

715
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,641
ぐっと惹かれるでしょう？
You'll be strongly attracted, right?

716
00:51:19,741 --> 00:51:21,141
おっと押さないでね
Oops, don't push.

717
00:51:21,241 --> 00:51:24,641
それでは準備OKですか？
So, are you ready?

718
00:51:24,741 --> 00:51:27,641
愉快な動物たち　玉乗りピエロ
Cheerful animals, ball-rolling clowns.

719
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:31,141
ハラハラドキドキしちゃうでしょ
It'll make your heart pound with excitement, right?

720
00:51:31,241 --> 00:51:35,641
真っ赤な輪くぐらせ　綱渡りして
Going through the bright red hoop, walking on the tightrope.

721
00:51:35,741 --> 00:51:40,641
ちょっとくらいのドジなんてご愛嬌よ
A little bit of clumsiness is just part of the charm.

722
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:42,641
Come on! Light up!

723
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:45,641
とっておきのライブ　ボーッとしてないで
A special live. Don't just stand there blankly.

724
00:51:45,741 --> 00:51:49,141
もっとさ　もっと　手を叩こう！
More, more, let's clap our hands!

725
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:52,641
ほらほらついておいで　目も回るような
Look, look, come along. A circus that makes your head spin.

726
00:51:52,741 --> 00:51:56,141
サーカス　きっとここだけだよ
It's definitely only here.

727
00:51:56,641 --> 00:52:00,141
ホログラムみたい　キラキラ
Like a hologram, sparkling

728
00:52:00,241 --> 00:52:03,141
奇跡が踊る
miracles dance.

729
00:52:03,241 --> 00:52:06,641
いつかは世界中を
Someday I'll

730
00:52:06,741 --> 00:52:10,141
虜にしちゃうぞ
captivate the whole world.

731
00:52:10,241 --> 00:52:11,141
はい！
Hai!

行くぜ、2番！みこち！
Let's go, part 2! Mikochi!

733
00:52:17,641 --> 00:52:21,141
うーん　明日の演目はどうしよっかな
Hmm, what should tomorrow's program be?

734
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:24,641
屋根裏で秘密の作戦会議さ
A secret strategy meeting in the attic.

735
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:28,141
いっぱいの観客席　あっと驚くような
A full audience. Let's show them

736
00:52:28,241 --> 00:52:31,641
とびきりのショーを見せましょう
an extraordinary show that will surprise them.

737
00:52:31,741 --> 00:52:35,141
思い付いたら　ジッとしてられない
Once I think of it, I can't sit still.

738
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:38,141
座員を引き連れて Let's go!
Taking the troupe along, Let's go!

739
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:42,141
ねえあれがやりたい　これもやりたい
Hey, I want to do that, I want to do this too.

740
00:52:42,241 --> 00:52:46,141
どうして時間って足りないの？
Why isn't there enough time?

741
00:52:49,141 --> 00:52:53,141
ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！
Hai! Hai! Hai! Hai! Hai!

742
00:52:53,241 --> 00:53:00,141
みんな！最後まで盛り上がっていけー！うおおおお！行くぜ！
Everyone! Keep getting excited until the end! Uooooo! Let's go!

743
00:53:00,241 --> 00:53:04,141
ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！
Hai! Hai! Hai! Hai! Hai!

744
00:53:04,241 --> 00:53:07,141
手拍子、お願いしまーす！
Clap your hands, please!

745
00:53:07,241 --> 00:53:13,641
ペンライト振ってる人はもっともっと振って！みんなの色、振っちゃって！
Those waving penlights, wave them more and more! Wave everyone's colors!

746
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:16,141
最後行きます
Here's the last part.

747
00:53:16,241 --> 00:53:22,641
上手くいかなくって　空回りってばかりで
When things don't go well and I'm just spinning my wheels.

748
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:26,641
少し落ち込んじゃう日もあるけれど
There are days when I feel a little down,

749
00:53:26,741 --> 00:53:29,641
見ててね
but watch me.

750
00:53:29,741 --> 00:53:33,641
大丈夫！いつまでも
It's okay! I can't

751
00:53:33,741 --> 00:53:36,641
クヨクヨしてらんないし
mope forever.

752
00:53:36,741 --> 00:53:41,641
顔を上げて　今日のステージがほら
Lifting my head, look, today's stage is

753
00:53:42,141 --> 00:53:44,641
ね！待ってるのさ
See! It's waiting for us.

754
00:53:44,741 --> 00:53:48,641
ポルカ！ポルカ！ポルカ！ポルカ！ポルカ！ポルカ！
Polka! Polka! Polka! Polka! Polka! Polka!

755
00:53:48,741 --> 00:53:51,141
ありがとうございまーす！
Thank you very much!

756
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:58,141
先輩たちと一緒に歌ってもらって！ポルカ降ります！ありがとうございます！
I had the senpais sing with me! Polka is coming down! Thank you very much!

757
00:53:58,241 --> 00:54:12,641
やばい、もうめっちゃテンション上がっちゃって！ドギマギしちゃってるんで！あれ？ちょっと待って、時間がわかんない！え、もうでも、まだ大丈夫だよね！？
Oh no, I'm getting so pumped up! My heart is pounding! Wait? Hold on, I don't know the time! Uh, but it's still okay, right!?

758
00:54:12,741 --> 00:54:13,641
いくぜ！
Let's go!

759
00:54:17,141 --> 00:54:21,141
強く強く願うんだ　どんな夢だって
Wish strongly, strongly. Any dream,

760
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:24,641
そうきっと叶うはず
yes, surely it will come true.

761
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:31,641
何も怖くない　ポルカの声は全部　ちゃんと届いてるよ
Nothing is scary. All of Polka's voice is reaching properly.

762
00:54:32,141 --> 00:54:35,641
さあ新しい次元　新しい舞台へ
Now to a new dimension, to a new stage.

763
00:54:35,741 --> 00:54:39,141
もっとさ　もっと　突き進もう！
More, more, let's push forward!

764
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:42,641
まだまだついておいで　笑い転げちゃう
Keep following us. A circus that will make you

765
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:46,141
サーカス　絶対ここだけだよ
roll with laughter. It's definitely only here.

766
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:53,141
初めての仲間　景色に心も踊る
First friends. My heart dances with the scenery.

767
00:54:53,241 --> 00:55:00,141
今にも世界中を　虜にしちゃうから
Because I'm about to captivate the whole world.

768
00:55:21,153 --> 00:55:28,153
そして、結果発表のときがやってきた……

00:56:00,153 --> 00:56:03,153
ありがとう……ありがとうみんな！！
Thank you... Thank you, everyone!!

776
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:07,653
ここまで来られたのも本当にみんなのおかげです
I'm only here today thanks to all of you.

777
00:56:08,153 --> 00:56:12,653
ありがとうございました！！これからもよろしくお願いしますっ！！
Thank you so much!! Please continue to support us!!

778
00:56:14,153 --> 00:56:17,653
えっ？ご褒美に宣伝させていただいてもいいんですか？わーい！！
Eh? Can I do a promo as a reward? Yay!!

779
00:56:21,953 --> 00:56:26,653

Look! A rubber mat! This 3,000 yen item is drawn by Kirako-sensei!

787
00:56:53,153 --> 00:56:58,153
めちゃくちゃ可愛いですよね！これあのね本当に、おー、なんだろ、ポルカ、
It's so cute, isn't it! This is really, like, Polka,

788
00:56:58,153 --> 00:57:04,653
「お前だけの尾丸ポルカだよ」っていうところをイメージしております。どうでしょうか。
giving off an "Omaru Polka only for you" vibe. What do you think?

789
00:57:05,153 --> 00:57:10,153
ポルカ、あなた、あなたに、あなたにしか見せない尾丸ポルカ。可愛いでしょ。うふふふ。
Polka... an Omaru Polka only for you. Cute, right? Ufufufu.

790
00:57:11,153 --> 00:57:14,153
というわけで、こちらさらに全世界お揃い宣言！
And so, this is a worldwide matching declaration!

791
00:57:14,153 --> 00:57:20,153
隠れポルカ推しリュック！こちら7000円になります！
The "Hidden Polka Fan" Backpack! This one is 7,000 yen!

792
00:57:20,153 --> 00:57:25,153
あー、もうこれね、現地で使いたい！絶対使いたい！
Ah, I want to use this at venues! I definitely want to!

793
00:57:25,153 --> 00:57:30,653
なんならポルカもこのラバーマットのところで一緒に背負ってるから！お揃いなんだよ！
In fact, Polka is carrying it in the rubber mat illustration too! We'll be matching!

794
00:57:30,653 --> 00:57:37,153
ポルカとお揃いな上に、さらにこれをつけてる、えー全員もお揃いになるので全世界お揃いになりますね、ということで。
Besides matching with Polka, everyone who has this will be matching too, so the whole world will be matching.

795
00:57:38,153 --> 00:57:44,153
もしね、あの現地に行く機会など、お外を歩く機会があれば、ま、これを背負っちゃって、というわけで。
So if you have a chance to go to a venue or walk outside, just carry this.

796
00:57:44,153 --> 00:57:49,153
ま、普段使いめちゃくちゃできるんだよね、これ。座員くんのこれね、チャームがついてる上に、
Actually, you can totally use this every day. It has a Zain-kun charm, and...

797
00:57:49,153 --> 00:57:57,153
裏地がね、なんとあらあらあらあら、これね尾丸ポルカ柄なんですよ。もういい仕事してくれますね。
the lining is, oh my, it's an Omaru Polka pattern! They did a great job.

798
00:57:58,153 --> 00:58:06,153
マジでちょうどいいサイズ感。学生さんも、社会人の休日にもめちゃくちゃ合います。
It's a really good size. It suits students and working people on their days off perfectly.

799
00:58:06,153 --> 00:58:09,153
そしてそしてこちら大注目のグッズ！
And then, here's a much-anticipated item!

800
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:13,153
家でも外でも！回らないポルペラヘアバンド！
At home or out! The "Non-spinning Pol-propeller" headband!

801
00:58:13,653 --> 00:58:18,153
こちら2500円になっておりますー。わー。いるよね、これもつけちゃってさー。
This one is 2,500 yen. Yay. You'll want to wear this one too.

802
00:58:19,153 --> 00:58:26,153
これつけて原宿歩きたいけど、あー楽しそう、そうなったら。「お前もポルペラついてんの？」ってなりそうですよね。
I want to walk around Harajuku wearing this. It'd be so fun. People would be like, "You've got a Pol-propeller too?"

803
00:58:27,153 --> 00:58:34,153
ま、普段使いとしては、ま、簡単に顔洗う時の前髪かき上げるのが無難かなーと思うんですが、
For daily use, I think using it to hold back your bangs when washing your face is the standard way,

804
00:58:34,153 --> 00:58:41,153
なんだろう、ポルカよくスタジオとかでこういうの着けてる人見るんで、多分なんかあの、
but I often see people wearing these in studios and such, so maybe...

805
00:58:41,153 --> 00:58:49,153
疲れてる人もこういうの着けたら会社とかでみんなと仲良くなれる気がします。どうでしょうか。個人の意見でございます。
I feel like tired people can wear this to get along with everyone at work. What do you think? Just my personal opinion.

806
00:58:49,153 --> 00:58:53,153
そして、一拍置かせておきます、の、ですがこれ！
And, let me take a breather, but look at this!

807
00:58:54,153 --> 00:58:59,153
記念ボイス！なんと！ASMRになっておりますー！
The commemorative voice! It's actually ASMR!

808
00:58:59,653 --> 00:59:09,653
こちら記念ボイスのASMRボイスはデート帰りの膝枕ボイス。膝枕ボイスー！おおお！
The ASMR voice is a lap-pillow voice after a date. A lap-pillow voice! Ooh!

809
00:59:10,153 --> 00:59:18,153
こちら価格が3000円となっておりますが、お値段以上のものだとポルカは思っております。えへへへ。
The price is 3,000 yen, but Polka thinks it's worth more than that. Ehehehe.

810
00:59:19,153 --> 00:59:29,153
なんてこんな、あーいやもう言えない、もう言葉に表せないけど、最近ちょっとポルカ成分、
How can I say... Ah, I can't say it, words can't describe it, but if you've been lacking Polka lately,

811
00:59:29,153 --> 00:59:36,153
オフポルカ成分なかったよなーって感じの人は、これ絶対聴くとね、めっちゃね、よく眠れると思う。本当に。
or "Off-Polka" lately, if you listen to this, you'll sleep really well. Seriously.

812
00:59:37,153 --> 00:59:49,153
あのね、すごい、もうわがまま言って少し長く取ってしまいましたので、ちょっとお値段がね、こうなってしまったんですが、その分の価値が絶対にあると思うので、
You know, it's great. I was selfish and made it a bit long, so the price ended up like this, but I'm sure it's worth it,

813
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:52,153
絶対に買ってくれよな。個人の意見です。
so please buy it. Just my personal opinion.

814
00:59:53,153 --> 00:59:56,653
はい、そして気になる販売期間となっておりますこちら！本日2022年1月30日から、
Okay, and here's the sales period! From today, January 30, 2022,

815
00:59:56,653 --> 01:00:00,153
2022年の3月7日、そしてこちら6時。

817
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:01,965
嘘じゃん。
Just kidding.

818
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,365
Japan... Japan Time...

819
01:00:03,465 --> 01:00:04,365
今のカットで！
Cut that part out!

820
01:00:04,465 --> 01:00:06,165
Japan Time, Japan Time...

01:00:06,265 --> 01:00:07,165
今のカットで！
Cut that part out!

822
01:00:07,265 --> 01:00:08,665
J-P-T... (笑)
J-P-T... (Laughs)

823
01:00:08,765 --> 01:00:12,465
日本時間の６時まで、18時までとなっております。
They will be available until 6:00 PM, or 18:00, Japan time.

824
01:00:12,565 --> 01:00:16,465
グッズはすべてこちら受注販売商品となっておりますので、
Since all of these items are made-to-order,

825
01:00:16,565 --> 01:00:18,565
慌てずお買い求めください。
please take your time with your purchase.

826
01:00:18,665 --> 01:00:22,165
というわけで、尾丸ポルカがお送りしました、
And with that, your host was Omaru Polka,

827
01:00:22,265 --> 01:00:26,465
ホロライブプロダクションそして尾丸ポルカ生誕祭のライブ、
bringing you the Hololive Production Omaru Polka Birthday Celebration Live.

828
01:00:26,565 --> 01:00:27,865
楽しかったでしょうか？
Did you have a good time?

829
01:00:27,965 --> 01:00:30,465
楽しめたなら何よりです。
If you enjoyed it, that makes me happier than anything.

830
01:00:30,565 --> 01:00:34,365
今日来ていただいたゲストというか、もう一緒にチームの仲間たちって感じなんだけど、
The guests who joined me today—well, they feel more like fellow teammates on the same team now—

831
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:36,965
ポルカがやりたいようにやらせていただいて、
they let Polka do things exactly the way I wanted to,

832
01:00:37,065 --> 01:00:40,565
そして見てる皆様もやりたいようにやってるポルカを、
and I hope all of you watching saw Polka doing as she pleased

833
01:00:40,665 --> 01:00:43,865
なんとなくぬるま湯っぽい目で見てくれたかなと思っております。
and watched over me with a sort of warm, gentle gaze.

834
01:00:43,965 --> 01:00:46,965
やりたいこと少しはまたやれたかなと思っております。
I think I was able to do a few more of the things I wanted to do.

835
01:00:47,065 --> 01:00:51,665
それではそれでは、ありがとうございました！
And so, and so, thank you very much!
