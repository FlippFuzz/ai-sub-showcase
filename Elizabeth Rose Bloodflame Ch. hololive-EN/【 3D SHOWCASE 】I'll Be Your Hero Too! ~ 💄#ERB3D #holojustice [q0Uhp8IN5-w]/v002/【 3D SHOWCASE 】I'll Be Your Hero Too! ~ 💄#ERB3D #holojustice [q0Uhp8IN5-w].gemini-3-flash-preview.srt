Whoa, what the freak?

26
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:18,948
Don't get in my way!

27
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:21,848
I don't have time to deal with the likes of you!

28
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:24,198
Wait back, and take this!

29
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:27,998

Good grief.

35
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:51,598
And today of all days, my commemorative 3D showcase!

36
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:56,068
Getting ambushed like this has been quite troublesome.

37
00:05:56,168 --> 00:05:59,998
Stuck with all the showcase preparations and practice I need to do.

38
00:06:00,998 --> 00:06:04,598
I can't afford to waste time on something like this.

39
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:08,568
There's not enough hours in the day. How annoying.

40
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:12,398
All right, you pop yourself there, Thorn. Stay there, stay there.

41
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:17,598
Listen to this, my self-introduction.

42
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:21,068
I shall practice.

43
00:06:21,868 --> 00:06:24,498
Oh-ho-ho-ha!

Lovely to see you, to see you, lovely!

48
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:48,098
All right, well, how was that?

49
00:06:49,098 --> 00:06:50,898
Tough crowd.

50
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:53,998
Oh gosh, I'm so behind!

51
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:57,198
We need to get to the karaoke place, Thorn. Come on, let's go!

52
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,198
What the freak?

53
00:07:02,898 --> 00:07:05,198
You lot again? You never learn, do you?

54
00:07:07,998 --> 00:07:10,998
All right, I guess it's time for round two.

55
00:07:16,498 --> 00:07:19,598
Oh my god, Thorn!

56
00:07:21,868 --> 00:07:24,198
You dare wound my flames?

57
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:27,568
You'll pay for this.

58
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:33,248
Very well, I'll deal with you...

59
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:37,998
...while practicing a song for my 3D showcase!

60
00:07:38,898 --> 00:07:42,598
Two birds, one stone. Listen well!

61
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:46,098
Huzzah!

We're connected; when one becomes two, there's nothing to worry about

All right, leave it to me, don't mind; what's with the waves? Let's all ride them, bye!

Is that the last of them?

117
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,063
Hmm.

118
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:44,863
My flame... it grows small due to my nerves.

119
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:46,863
I need to shake it off.

120
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:50,263
I can't appear before everyone like this.

121
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,863
Ah... my phone.

122
00:11:58,563 --> 00:11:59,863
Oh... what the frig?

123
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:02,063
My karaoke room booking plus?

124
00:12:02,063 --> 00:12:04,263
I don't have a lot of time till the showcase!

125

Okay...

126
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:13,263
Alright, time to go to karaoke. Come on, Thorn.

Okay.

Heaven, please sing for me a song of life.

138
00:13:58,063 --> 00:14:03,063
Heaven, take me into your skies.

139
00:14:03,563 --> 00:14:08,563
There's no place here for me to hide my cries.

140
00:14:08,563 --> 00:14:13,063
Night and day I'm missing you.

141
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:16,263
I know I'm here for the magic.

142
00:14:16,263 --> 00:14:22,063
All your stars guiding me through and through.

143
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:27,863
Oh, why does this loneliness feel like forever and ever?

144
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:33,063
I gotta be, I gotta be in your arms, baby.

145
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,863
So close, so close.

146
00:14:35,863 --> 00:14:38,563
And it's you that I believe in, I believe in.

147
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:41,263
So close...

148
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:43,563
...but far away so far I can't touch.

149
00:14:43,563 --> 00:14:48,863
I'll hold on, 'cause it's you I love so dearly.

150
00:14:48,863 --> 00:14:51,563
When the rain, the storm and all is done...

151
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:54,063
...caress me with your sweet lullaby.

152
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:18,428
Heaven, please sing for me a song of light

153
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:23,178
Heaven, save me and my dreams tonight

154
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:28,178
Someday these wings will perish in your sight

155
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:33,478
Night and day I call for you

156
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,478
Flashes of moments so tragic

157
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:43,178
Wandering souls they fall along the way

158
00:15:43,678 --> 00:15:47,878
Tell me you will never leave me forever and ever

159
00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:52,878
I gotta be I gotta be in your arms hear me

160
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:55,778
So close, so close

161
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:59,878
And it's you that I believe in, I believe in

162
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,778
So close, but far away I seek for your light

163
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:07,778
I'll hold on 'cause for you my heart keeps beating

164
00:16:08,178 --> 00:16:11,378
When the wind, the fire and all is gone

165
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:14,678
Caress me with your sweet lullaby

166
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:18,178
Will you be my light? Will you be my strength?

167
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:23,278
Promise you won't let me go

168
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:29,878
I'll never betray in the end of time

169
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:34,378
Still my love's gonna be there

170
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:37,878
So close, so close

171
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:41,878
And it's you that I believe in, I believe in

172
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:44,878
So close, but far away, so far I can't touch

173
00:16:45,378 --> 00:16:48,878
I'll hold on 'cause it's you I love so dearly

174
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:52,678
When the rain, the storm and all is gone

175
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,378
Caress me with your sweet lullaby

176
00:16:55,478 --> 00:16:57,778
So close, so close

177
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:01,878
And it's you that I believe in, I believe in

178
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,178
So close, but far away I seek for your light

179
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:09,178
I'll hold on 'cause for you my heart keeps beating

180
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:12,878
When the wind, the fire and all is gone

181
00:17:13,178 --> 00:17:16,278
Caress me with your sweet lullaby

182
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:49,878
Hmm... well...

183
00:17:50,078 --> 00:17:53,078
This song is lovely,

184
00:17:53,178 --> 00:17:57,078
but for my showcase performance, should I pick nostalgic songs?

185
00:17:57,278 --> 00:17:58,578
Hmm...

186
00:18:02,278 --> 00:18:03,878
Oh, it's a call!

187
00:18:05,578 --> 00:18:07,578
Bleeh! My favorite kohai!

188
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:09,578
How are you, Bibi?

189
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:14,378
Ollie-senpai! Perfect timing.

190
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:18,578
Actually, I'm having trouble deciding what to sing for my 3D showcase.

191
00:18:18,678 --> 00:18:20,078
Yeah...

192
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:21,878
Is that so?

193
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:25,578
Though I think I speak for everyone when I say,

194
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:28,578
"We'll be happy to hear you sing anything!"

195
00:18:28,678 --> 00:18:31,078
As long as you're enjoying yourself, that is.

196
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:33,278
Yeah, but...

197
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,578
Isn't it standard to pick songs that match your image?

198
00:18:36,678 --> 00:18:40,078
There's an expectation to be cool, right?

199
00:18:40,178 --> 00:18:44,278
But since this is a special occasion and all, I was thinking maybe I should show other sides of myself.

200
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:46,078
Hmm, I see.

201
00:18:46,378 --> 00:18:50,078
Well, you know how powerful you look when you sing?

202
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:51,578
Yes, yes.

203
00:18:51,678 --> 00:18:53,878
So I thought, you know...

204
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:56,578
Why not try a cute song instead?

205
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:00,078
Go for that gap moe appeal, you know what I'm saying?

206
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:03,578
Cute song... that would be different from usual, which would be good,

207
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:06,078
but I'm a bit worried about doing it alone. Hmm...

208
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,078
Ah! That's it!

209
00:19:08,178 --> 00:19:12,578
What if we invited my brothers-in-arms, ARMIS as guests?

210
00:19:12,678 --> 00:19:14,578
That's a great idea!

211
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:17,578
Seeing cool people singing cute songs...

212
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:22,578
Oh, the gap moe will definitely get everybody excited!

213
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:26,578
But... it's still a tad embarrassing.

214
00:19:26,678 --> 00:19:28,278
It'll be fine!

215
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:30,878
Come on, try imagining it.

216
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:35,078
Picture you and ARMIS singing a cute song together!

217
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:37,078
Okay... me and ARMIS...

218
00:19:37,178 --> 00:19:38,878
Cute song...

219
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:45,078
...together!

220
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:06,593

私は私のこと愛して
I love myself

223
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:13,093
何が広いの？ヒーローでしょうか
What's wrong with that? I'm a hero, right?

224
00:20:13,593 --> 00:20:16,593
痛いだとかなんとか言われても
Even if they say it hurts or whatever

225
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:19,093
届きませんね そのヴィトリオリック
Those vitriolics won't reach me

226
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,593
大好きな抱擁は省く
I'll skip the favorite hugs

227
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:25,593
大好きなお化粧で
With my favorite makeup

228
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:29,093
お決まりのハーフツイン巻いて
With my usual half-twin tails

229
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:32,093
お出かけしよう
Let's go out

230
00:20:32,193 --> 00:20:34,593

Holding a parasol even if I'm alone

00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:37,593

Because I'm happy

私に干渉しないでください
Please don't interfere with me

類は友を呼ぶと言うけど
They say birds of a feather flock together, but

届きませんね その陰口
Those badmouthing won't reach me

Unyuu... Hyou. You know, maybe,

275
00:23:43,193 --> 00:23:47,593
maybe I'm not cut out to be a ku-ku-ku-cute idol!

276
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,293
That's not true!

277
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:53,593
I'm sure everyone wants to see that side of you too, Liz!

278
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:58,293
Oh, but thank you, yeah! I feel better about it since you think so, Ollie-senpai!

279
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:02,093
It makes me happy you think I'm ku-ku-ku-powerful! Hahahaha!

280
00:24:02,193 --> 00:24:04,593
Yeah! Powerful indeed! Hehehe.

281
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:08,593
Oh gosh, seems like it's the end of my karaoke room booking rehearsal time is up here.

282
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:11,593
Ollie-senpai, thank you so so much!

283
00:24:12,093 --> 00:24:14,593
Alright, do your best, Liz! Bye-bye!

284
00:24:15,093 --> 00:24:16,893
Bye-bye! I shall!

285
00:24:17,093 --> 00:24:20,093
Okay, here we go! Hup!

286
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:24,093
Okay, let's go, let's go!

287
00:24:24,193 --> 00:24:25,893
Eh... Oh come on!

288
00:24:26,093 --> 00:24:29,093
Alright, here we go! Woo!

289
00:24:50,093 --> 00:24:52,593
Hmm, my singing is fine,

290
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:57,093
but now the physical performance side of bits and bobs is what worries me.

291
00:24:57,193 --> 00:24:59,093
I'm really not too confident...

292
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:03,608
...about my dancing as I'm a... (chuckles) a tad rusty.

293
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:07,608
Oh, what's wrong Liz?

294
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:09,608
Zeta Senpai!

295
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:14,108
Well, actually, I've been worried about my showcase performance...

296
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:20,108
...as it's getting closer and closer, and I'm not very confident about my dancing.

297
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:23,608
Hmm, is that all? Don't worry, don't worry!

298
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:27,608
When it comes to dancing, as long as you have your passion...

299
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:30,108
...mistakes don't even exist.

300
00:25:30,608 --> 00:25:34,608
Haha, yeah, true. But I'm still a bit worried.

301
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:39,108
Well, in that case, how about this? Come to my jazz club!

302
00:25:39,108 --> 00:25:43,608
If we practice together, I'm sure you'll have more of a spring in your step.

303
00:25:44,108 --> 00:25:46,108
Wait, right now?

304
00:25:46,108 --> 00:25:49,108
Well, that's really nice of you Zeta Senpai, but you know...

305
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:51,608
Okay, follow me Liz!

306
00:25:51,608 --> 00:25:54,108
Oh yeah, dance... (grunts)

307
00:25:56,608 --> 00:25:58,108
Let's move and groove!

308
00:25:58,108 --> 00:26:00,108
No, wait, Zeta Senpai!

309
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:03,608
Wait, what do you mean by move and groove? No, what the-?!

I want I want I want 撃ちあけてくれ
I want, I want, I want you to open up to me

317
00:26:55,108 --> 00:26:58,608
Sha la la la la...

318
00:26:58,608 --> 00:27:00,608
Oh yeah!

319
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:02,608
Yeah!

320
00:27:03,108 --> 00:27:05,608
Sha la la la la...

321
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:08,608
Oh yeah!

322
00:27:08,608 --> 00:27:11,608
手錠のままでいい
It's fine to stay in handcuffs

323
00:27:11,608 --> 00:27:14,108
素顔を見せてよ
Show me your true face

324
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:17,608
心乱されて欲しくなる
My heart is in disarray, and I start to want you

325
00:27:17,608 --> 00:27:20,608
独占なんて嘘でしょう
Monopolizing me must be a lie

326
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:24,108
はぐらかしてじれったい
It's frustrating how you're being evasive

327
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:27,608
どうにかなりそう
I feel like I'm going crazy

328
00:27:27,608 --> 00:27:31,608
口付けるほどに足りなくなる
The more we kiss, the more it's not enough

329
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:35,608
抱き寄せたら意外なほど
When I hold you close, surprisingly...

330
00:27:35,608 --> 00:27:38,108
寂しい目で見つめるから
...you look at me with such lonely eyes...

331
00:27:38,108 --> 00:27:41,608
逆効果だ だったったった
...it's counterproductive

332
00:27:41,608 --> 00:27:44,608
ギラギラな夢を見せてよ
Show me a dazzling dream

333
00:27:44,608 --> 00:27:48,608
全部ばら撒いて星にして
Scatter it all and turn it into stars

334
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:52,608
純情じゃないところも知りたい
I want to know your non-innocent parts too

335
00:27:52,608 --> 00:27:56,108
もう我慢できない
I can't hold back anymore

336
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:00,608
I want I want I want 撃ちあけてくれ
I want, I want, I want you to open up to me

337
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:04,108
Sha la la la la...

338
00:28:04,108 --> 00:28:06,108
Hi yeah!

339
00:28:06,108 --> 00:28:08,608
Your turn. My turn. Mm-hm. Okay.

340
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:11,608
ドラマなんて飽きたでしょう
You must be tired of dramas

341
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:15,608
二人だけのラスト描かなくちゃ
We must draw a finale just for the two of us

342
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:18,608
運命だなんてじゃれあって
Joking about it being fate...

343
00:28:18,608 --> 00:28:22,608
演じ切ればいいんじゃない
...why not just play the part until the end?

344
00:28:22,608 --> 00:28:26,108
裏腹な言葉で
With contradictory words...

345
00:28:26,108 --> 00:28:30,108
また覚悟を試してくるのに
...you're testing my resolve again

346
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:34,108
独りきりにさせないでよと
"Don't leave me alone," you say...

347
00:28:34,108 --> 00:28:38,108
寂しげに笑うからずるいよ
...it's unfair how you smile so sadly

348
00:28:38,108 --> 00:28:39,608
なななな
Na na na na

349
00:28:39,608 --> 00:28:43,108
ギリギリな恋人たちは
Lovers on the edge...

350
00:28:43,108 --> 00:28:47,108
切ないこの夜を満たせるね
...can satisfy this painful night

351
00:28:47,108 --> 00:28:50,608
擬制じゃないもっと奥の方
It's not a pretense, even deeper inside...

352
00:28:50,608 --> 00:28:54,108
震えていれば赤くなる
...it turns red if it trembles

353
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:58,608
I want I want I want 撃ちあけだしてくれ
I want, I want, I want you to start opening up to me

354
00:28:58,608 --> 00:29:02,108
Sha la la la la...

355
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,108
Yeah!

356
00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:16,608
泣かないで それ以上
Don't cry any more

357
00:29:16,608 --> 00:29:20,608
心撃ち抜かないで
Don't shoot through my heart

358
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:27,608
震わせた瞳に狂わされてしまう
I'm driven mad by your trembling eyes

359
00:29:28,108 --> 00:29:31,608
完璧な敗北さ
It's a perfect defeat

360
00:29:31,608 --> 00:29:35,108
もう離せなんかしない
I won't ever let you go

361
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:37,108
この指を
These fingers...

362
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,108
この指を
These fingers...

363
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:42,608
この愛を
This love...

364
00:29:43,108 --> 00:29:46,608
ギリギリで信じてほしい
I want you to believe, even on the edge

365
00:29:46,608 --> 00:29:50,608
二人なら真実になれる
Together, we can become the truth

366
00:29:50,608 --> 00:29:54,608
告白は最後の誓いさ
This confession is the final vow

367
00:29:54,608 --> 00:29:59,108
もう抱きしめたいよ
I want to hold you already

368
00:30:00,123 --> 00:30:03,123
ギリギリな愛を愛し合わそう
Let's share a love on the edge

369
00:30:03,423 --> 00:30:06,923
遅まきもエキゾチックを夢見て
Dreaming of the exotic, even if it's late

370
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:10,623
冗談じゃない もう音 踊りたい
No joke, I want to dance to the sound already

371
00:30:11,323 --> 00:30:14,123
もう我慢できない
I can't take it anymore

372
00:30:15,823 --> 00:30:19,623
I want, I want を散らかしてくれ
Make a mess of "I want, I want"

373
00:30:20,623 --> 00:30:22,623
Sha-la-la-la...

374
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:24,123
Oh yeah!

375
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:29,623
Sha-la-la-la...

376
00:30:30,323 --> 00:30:32,623
Oh yeah! Come on!

377
00:30:33,323 --> 00:30:34,123
Hey!

378
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:35,623
Huh!

379
00:30:36,123 --> 00:30:37,623
Go go!

380
00:30:55,123 --> 00:30:56,123
ふう...
(Sighs)

381
00:30:57,123 --> 00:31:00,123
So, how was it? Once you get into it,

382
00:31:00,123 --> 00:31:02,123
it's a good feeling, right?

383
00:31:02,123 --> 00:31:04,623
Dance like nobody's watching, have fun!

384
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:08,123
Yes! Somehow I really gained confidence.

385
00:31:08,623 --> 00:31:10,123
Thank you, Zeta-senpai.

386
00:31:10,623 --> 00:31:14,623
Oh, Liz. You always tell others mistake help them grow and believing in themselves.

387
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:18,123
You really need to start taking your own advice.

388
00:31:18,623 --> 00:31:21,123
Listen to your own heart's flame.

389
00:31:21,123 --> 00:31:23,123
Let that be your strength.

390
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:28,123
Yeah... You're right.

391
00:31:28,623 --> 00:31:31,123
Sometimes I forget, but...

392
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,623
thank you for reminding me.

393
00:31:34,123 --> 00:31:37,123
Guess I'm only human. Hahaha!

394
00:31:39,623 --> 00:31:42,123
Here, let me help you take that off.

395
00:31:42,323 --> 00:31:44,623
Hey, but I look so dapper though, innit?

396
00:31:45,123 --> 00:31:46,623
It looks so cool!

397
00:31:49,923 --> 00:31:51,623
Wah! Uh!

398
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:53,123
Ouch!

399
00:31:57,623 --> 00:31:59,623
What's with you, Liz?

400
00:32:00,123 --> 00:32:02,623
I'm sure your debut will be wonderful.

401
00:32:02,623 --> 00:32:04,123
I'm looking forward to it.

402
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:06,623
As you say, believe in me...

403
00:32:06,623 --> 00:32:08,623
...who believes in thee!

404
00:32:08,623 --> 00:32:10,123
Huzzah!

405
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:35,623
Well, the preparations for the showcase seem to be going smoothly.

406
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:40,123
So much has happened since we infiltrated Holo.

407
00:32:40,123 --> 00:32:42,123
Songs, performances,

408
00:32:42,123 --> 00:32:45,123
troubles, challenges, and kind words too.

409
00:32:46,123 --> 00:32:49,623
All of them are irreplaceable memories I'll cherish forever.

410
00:32:50,623 --> 00:32:54,623
I want to do my best for my family, my friends, my kingdom,

411
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:58,623
and of course my talented girlies, Justice.

412
00:32:59,623 --> 00:33:01,623
Onwards and upwards!

413
00:33:06,623 --> 00:33:08,623
Flame off!

414
00:33:10,623 --> 00:33:14,123
Phew, still, it's been such a busy day.

415
00:33:14,623 --> 00:33:17,123
Maybe I should rest for a bit.

416
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:20,623
Just a little... little nap won't hurt anybody.

417
00:33:22,623 --> 00:33:26,623
My manager says I should nap anyways, so it's fine.

418
00:33:48,123 --> 00:33:53,123
一番の宝物 ~Yui final ver.~
Ichiban no Takaramono ~Yui final ver.~

419
00:33:48,123 --> 00:33:53,123
Lyrics, Music: 麻枝准
Lyrics, Music: Jun Maeda

420
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:09,623
顔を合わしたら 喧嘩してばかり
Every time we faced each other, we did nothing but fight

421
00:34:10,123 --> 00:34:17,123
それもいい思い出だった
Even that was a good memory

422
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:25,623
君が教えてくれたんだ もう怖くない
You taught me that I'm not afraid anymore

423
00:34:25,923 --> 00:34:34,123
どんな不自由でも 幸せは掴める だから
No matter the hardship, I can grasp happiness, so...

424
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:49,123
一人でもゆくよ たとえ辛くても
I'll go on alone, even if it's painful

425
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:58,623
君と見た夢は 必ず持ってくよ
The dream I shared with you, I'll definitely take it with me

426
00:35:00,138 --> 00:35:01,238
あった
...there were,

427
00:35:01,238 --> 00:35:05,238
他の誰でもない
and it was no one else.

428
00:35:05,238 --> 00:35:09,238
出会えた目覚めた朝
The morning I met you and woke up,

429
00:35:09,238 --> 00:35:13,438
君はいないんだね
you aren't here, are you?

430
00:35:30,738 --> 00:35:33,938
ずっと遊んでた
We played together forever,

431
00:35:33,938 --> 00:35:37,838
そんな気がしてた
or so it felt like.

432
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:41,938
気がしていただけ
It was just a feeling,

433
00:35:41,938 --> 00:35:44,338
わかってた
I knew that.

434
00:35:45,638 --> 00:35:49,138
生まれてきたこと
Even having been born,

435
00:35:49,138 --> 00:35:52,638
もう後悔はしない
I won't regret it anymore.

436
00:35:52,638 --> 00:35:56,938
祭りの後みたい
It's like after a festival,

437
00:35:56,938 --> 00:36:03,538
寂しいけどそろそろ行こう
it's lonely, but it's time to go.

438
00:36:09,938 --> 00:36:13,738
どこまでも行くよ
I'll go anywhere,

439
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:17,738
ここでしたこと
the things I did here,

440
00:36:17,738 --> 00:36:21,338
幸せという夢
that dream called happiness,

441
00:36:21,338 --> 00:36:25,938
を叶えてみせるよ
I'll make it come true.

442
00:36:25,938 --> 00:36:29,738
君と離れても
Even if I'm away from you,

443
00:36:29,738 --> 00:36:34,138
どんなに遠くなっても
no matter how far apart we are,

444
00:36:34,138 --> 00:36:37,738
新しい朝に
at the dawn of a new morning,

445
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:42,338
あたしは生きるよ
I will live on.

446
00:37:16,938 --> 00:37:21,138
一人でも行くよ
I'll go even if I'm alone,

447
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:25,138
死にたくなっても
even if I feel like dying.

448
00:37:25,138 --> 00:37:29,138
声が聞こえるよ
I can hear a voice,

449
00:37:29,138 --> 00:37:33,638
死んではいけないと
telling me I mustn't die.

450
00:37:33,938 --> 00:37:37,738
たとえ辛くても
Even if it's painful,

451
00:37:37,738 --> 00:37:41,738
寂しさに泣いても
even if I cry from loneliness,

452
00:37:41,738 --> 00:37:45,738
心の奥には
deep within my heart,

453
00:37:45,738 --> 00:37:49,938
ぬくもりを感じるよ
I feel a warmth.

454
00:37:50,138 --> 00:37:54,138
巡って流れて
Circling and flowing,

455
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:57,738
時は移ろいだ
time has shifted.

456
00:37:57,738 --> 00:38:01,738
もう何があったか
What happened before,

457
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:05,938
思い出せないけど
I can't remember anymore, but...

458
00:38:06,138 --> 00:38:10,138
目を閉じてみれば
If I try closing my eyes,

459
00:38:10,138 --> 00:38:14,138
誰かの笑い声
I hear someone's laughter.

460
00:38:14,138 --> 00:38:18,138
なぜかそれが今
For some reason, that is now

461
00:38:18,138 --> 00:38:22,638
一番の宝物
my most precious treasure.

462
00:38:37,938 --> 00:38:45,938
一人でも行くよ
I'll go even if I'm alone,

463
00:38:54,638 --> 00:39:04,638
どこまでも行くよ
I'll go anywhere,

464
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:07,693
Hmm... (yawns)

465
00:40:08,693 --> 00:40:10,693
Oh, that dream.

466
00:40:11,193 --> 00:40:14,193
What a beautiful, touching song.

467
00:40:14,693 --> 00:40:18,693
You know what? I should probably add that to my showcase.

468
00:40:19,693 --> 00:40:21,693
(Gasps)

469
00:40:22,693 --> 00:40:24,193
MY SHOWCASE!

470
00:40:24,693 --> 00:40:26,693
Oh no!

471
00:40:26,793 --> 00:40:27,693
Flame on!

472
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:32,193
Oh gosh! I'm gonna be late for my showcase! What the fudge!

473
00:40:33,693 --> 00:40:35,693
All right. My showcase, my showcase, my showcase.

474
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:37,693
All right. Open door! Let's go!

475
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:41,193
Come on! Ah!

476
00:40:53,193 --> 00:41:04,193
Now Loading

477
00:41:04,194 --> 00:41:13,193
Now Loading

478
00:41:13,194 --> 00:41:23,193
Now Loading

479
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:33,193
Now Loading

480
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:45,193
Now Loading

481
00:42:13,193 --> 00:42:15,693
ELIZABETH ROSE BLOODFLAME

482
00:42:15,793 --> 00:42:17,193
Rosarians!

483
00:42:17,693 --> 00:42:20,693
My Bloodflame Kingdom!

484
00:42:20,793 --> 00:42:23,193
How is the performance thus far?

485
00:42:23,693 --> 00:42:27,693
Let me know what you all think using the hashtag ERB 3D.

486
00:42:28,193 --> 00:42:31,193
ERB 3D.

487
00:42:31,693 --> 00:42:34,193
What have you loved most thus far?

488
00:42:34,293 --> 00:42:36,693
Is it this beautiful theater?

489
00:42:36,793 --> 00:42:39,193
The Queen Mother Theatre? Named after me mum.

490
00:42:39,693 --> 00:42:41,193
Hi, Mum!

491
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:43,193
(Laughs) Hello!

492
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:46,693
Was it Ollie's appearance? Flayon and Oga's voiceovers?

493
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:50,193
Kawaikute Gomen sung with ARMIS?

494
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,193
Giri Giri with Ze-a?

495
00:42:52,293 --> 00:42:56,693
Oh gosh, it would make me super-duper happy hearing your thoughts.

496
00:42:57,693 --> 00:43:00,193
And by the way, I can see you all right now!

497
00:43:00,693 --> 00:43:02,693
Oh my gosh! I see you guys!

498
00:43:02,793 --> 00:43:06,693
I see you at the corner of my eye with a magical invisible box...

499
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,693
...made by the Rosarian invisible wizards!

500
00:43:10,693 --> 00:43:14,193
So I can see you all right now! Oh my gosh!

501
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:16,693
This is crazy. What do you think about my 3D appearance?

502
00:43:17,193 --> 00:43:20,693
Huh? Huh? Let me know in chat right now...

503
00:43:21,193 --> 00:43:24,193
...what poses you would like to see.

504
00:43:24,693 --> 00:43:27,693
Yeah, yeah, let me know. While you're doing that...

505
00:43:28,193 --> 00:43:30,693
...I'm going to go get Thorn.

506
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:35,193
Yeah! It's the one, the only, Thorn!

507
00:43:36,193 --> 00:43:39,193
Hello, I'm Thorn! (Laughs)

508
00:43:40,693 --> 00:43:43,193
Let's do a quick pose with Thorn, shall we?

509
00:43:44,193 --> 00:43:48,193
Hah! Huzzah!

510
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,693
Huzzah! (Laughs)

511
00:43:52,193 --> 00:43:54,693
All right, let's see what you guys have put.

512
00:43:58,693 --> 00:44:00,693
Um... huh? A cat pose?

513
00:44:01,193 --> 00:44:04,693
Hah! All right, sure. Let me just put Thorn over here.

514
00:44:06,693 --> 00:44:10,693
Let's take the jacket off for this one. Flame off!

515
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:16,193
Okay... I need to become Raora.

516
00:44:18,693 --> 00:44:22,693
Nya, nya-nya! Nya!

517
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:27,693
Nya-nya, nya! Nya! Ah...

518
00:44:28,193 --> 00:44:30,193
T-pose? Okay!

519
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:33,193
That one's easy! (Laughs)

520
00:44:33,693 --> 00:44:36,693
Yes! I shall assert my dominance on you all!

521
00:44:37,693 --> 00:44:40,693
Oh, you know what I want to do? I want to headpat you all.

522
00:44:40,793 --> 00:44:42,693
Come here! I headpat.

523
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:45,193
Headpat, headpat, and hug!

524
00:44:45,693 --> 00:44:49,193
Hah! We must do this, we must hug!

525
00:44:50,193 --> 00:44:54,693
Hug, hug! Hah! One more!

526
00:45:00,214 --> 00:45:02,014
What else have you all put? Victory pose?

527
00:45:02,114 --> 00:45:03,314
Like this?

528
00:45:03,614 --> 00:45:04,614
Hah!

529
00:45:05,614 --> 00:45:08,014
Yes, I am victorious!

530
00:45:08,064 --> 00:45:11,914
For I am the Queen of the Bloodflame Kingdom!

531
00:45:13,014 --> 00:45:14,514
Yeah.

532
00:45:15,514 --> 00:45:17,714
I love you all very much too!

533
00:45:17,814 --> 00:45:19,614
So happy you're all here!

534
00:45:20,514 --> 00:45:22,714
Oh gosh.

535
00:45:24,014 --> 00:45:26,714
Absolute cinema, yes!

536
00:45:27,914 --> 00:45:29,314
Okay.

537
00:45:30,014 --> 00:45:32,914
Oh, a twirl? Okay, we shall do a twirl.

538
00:45:33,414 --> 00:45:34,414
All right.

539
00:45:34,614 --> 00:45:36,614
Hah! Yes.

540
00:45:37,614 --> 00:45:38,714
Twirl.

541
00:45:40,614 --> 00:45:41,614
Whoa!

542
00:45:43,214 --> 00:45:45,014
Is that okay?

543
00:45:45,214 --> 00:45:46,614
A twirl.

544
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:48,014
Jazz hands.

545
00:45:48,614 --> 00:45:50,014
A spin! Spina!

546
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:52,014
Twina!

547
00:45:56,714 --> 00:45:59,214
Oh gosh. A curtsy? Oh, that's a good one.

548
00:46:00,514 --> 00:46:01,514
Like this...

549
00:46:03,614 --> 00:46:05,114
I curtsy.

550
00:46:08,614 --> 00:46:10,114
And I bow.

551
00:46:11,614 --> 00:46:13,314
Cute? Hey, you mean... you mean...

552
00:46:13,414 --> 00:46:15,114
...you mean powerful, right?

553
00:46:15,214 --> 00:46:17,514
Powerful! Yes, yes, yes! Powerful!

554
00:46:19,114 --> 00:46:21,114
Rawr!

555
00:46:22,114 --> 00:46:24,514
I know you guys also like my shocked face.

556
00:46:24,614 --> 00:46:27,514
So let me just think of something real shocking.

557
00:46:30,514 --> 00:46:34,014
What the frig!?

558
00:46:35,114 --> 00:46:37,614
What the frig!

559
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:41,714
What the frig! Time is nearly up for poses!

560
00:46:43,514 --> 00:46:46,614
Oh, I guess it's time for the next song!

561
00:46:48,614 --> 00:46:50,314
Would you like to hear another song?

562
00:46:50,514 --> 00:46:52,514
Yes! Sure you do!

563
00:46:52,614 --> 00:46:55,614
All right, just wait one moment. I need some bits and bobs for this one.

564
00:46:56,614 --> 00:46:58,514
All right. Some bits and the bobs...

565
00:46:58,614 --> 00:47:01,614
...and the bobs and the bits.

566
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:06,114
All right.

567
00:47:07,014 --> 00:47:09,114
Here we go. Here's the bits and the bobs.

568
00:47:09,214 --> 00:47:11,114
I have a stand. It's my mic!

569
00:47:12,114 --> 00:47:14,214
Look at that! And I have a guitar.

570
00:47:20,014 --> 00:47:22,014
Ha! I'm so かっこいい.
Ha! I'm so cool.

571
00:47:23,114 --> 00:47:27,714
All right. Let's go with a cute... I mean, a powerful song next.

572
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:33,514
Please listen to: 私の恋はホッチキス
Please listen to: Watashi no Koi wa Hotchkiss

573
00:47:34,414 --> 00:47:38,314
The next song is 'My Love is a Stapler'. Let's go!

00:47:42,714 --> 00:47:46,214
わたしの恋はホッチキス

The beginning was just a light feeling,

589
00:48:59,664 --> 00:49:02,754

But before I knew it, I became passionate,

590
00:49:03,694 --> 00:49:07,244
もう針がなんだか
And now the staples...

591
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,644
通らない

If I throw these feelings in the trash can,

597
00:49:46,194 --> 00:49:50,264
この胸が切ないから
my heart will feel so painful,

598
00:49:51,164 --> 00:49:54,234
持っていようかな
so maybe I'll keep them.

599
00:49:54,234 --> 00:49:57,694
今の気持ちを　表す
Expressing my current feelings,

600
00:49:58,664 --> 00:50:00,214

How was it? Did you like my guitar playing?

626
00:52:07,235 --> 00:52:10,235
Oi! Well, you guys didn't know this,

627
00:52:11,235 --> 00:52:14,735

show yourself to the camera, do a little twirl or something, yeah.

636
00:52:45,235 --> 00:52:46,735
Oh, you're so cute.

637
00:52:47,235 --> 00:52:48,735
Wait a minute! What the freak?

638
00:52:48,735 --> 00:52:49,735
Bobby!

639
00:52:50,235 --> 00:52:54,235
We should... come here, come here, come here.

Oh, he's such a little cheeky guy. Little cheeky guy.

642
00:53:03,735 --> 00:53:05,235
Oh golly.

643
00:53:05,735 --> 00:53:08,735
Well, as you can see on Bobby's head,

644
00:53:09,235 --> 00:53:11,235
the announcement is merchandise!

645
00:53:12,235 --> 00:53:15,735
Oh my goodness, we have this!

A set product that includes an acrylic stand

650
00:53:29,235 --> 00:53:32,235
where you can plop your mini Thorn into.

651
00:53:32,235 --> 00:53:36,235
It looks real cool on your desk and you'll get all the maidens.

652
00:53:36,235 --> 00:53:41,235
I should know, a lot of them have visited my dressing room to see the prototype.

653
00:53:41,235 --> 00:53:43,735
And that's no lie, it's pretty awesome.

654
00:53:44,235 --> 00:53:49,735
And also, the sales date will be after the Justice collaboration stream.

655
00:53:50,235 --> 00:53:54,735
So once that's all done and dusted, it'll be out there on the shop.

656
00:53:55,735 --> 00:53:59,235
And that concludes the merchandise. Thank you Bobby!

657
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:02,235
Everybody thank Bobby! Thank you Bobby!

658
00:54:02,235 --> 00:54:05,235
Thank you so much! You're such a good boy,

659
00:54:05,235 --> 00:54:07,735
you're such a good boy, yes you are, you are, you are!

660
00:54:07,735 --> 00:54:11,735
Alright, back to the Duke and the Queen Mother you go.

661
00:54:13,735 --> 00:54:18,235
Oh gosh, I honestly can't believe it. Time has flown.

662
00:54:19,235 --> 00:54:26,235
And it's already time for our last final seventh song, "Symphony"!

663
00:54:26,735 --> 00:54:29,235
This has been quite the journey and a half,

664
00:54:29,735 --> 00:54:32,735
so before I end, I just want to thank everyone.

665
00:54:33,235 --> 00:54:37,235
The cast, our wonderful guests, the crew, managers, the director.

666
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:41,235
Thank you so much. Thank you for your hard work.

667
00:54:41,235 --> 00:54:44,235
Thank you, thank you so much.

668
00:54:45,235 --> 00:54:48,735
And of course, my friends, my family, my beautiful kingdom.

669
00:54:48,735 --> 00:54:53,235
Thanks for supporting me so much. I wouldn't be standing here right now.

670
00:54:53,235 --> 00:54:55,735
Not only do I get to fight for justice,

671
00:54:57,235 --> 00:55:00,235
but with my wonderful girlies, Raora, Gigi...

672
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:01,556
...Gigi, and Cecilia,

673
00:55:01,556 --> 00:55:03,056
but I also get to do what I love.

674
00:55:03,256 --> 00:55:04,856
So thank you so much.

675
00:55:05,356 --> 00:55:07,656
I get to give the gift of smiles

676
00:55:07,656 --> 00:55:10,756
and strength through the art of performance and singing.

677
00:55:11,256 --> 00:55:13,656
I hope I can do this forever

678
00:55:14,056 --> 00:55:17,556
and we could keep spreading smiles throughout the realms together.

679
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:19,856
That would make me so happy.

680
00:55:20,356 --> 00:55:22,656
Anyway, before the allergies hit me too much,

681
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:25,056
let me just move my stand.

682
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:28,856
Allergies guys, the allergies.

683
00:55:29,856 --> 00:55:31,156
I can't stand the stand!

684
00:55:31,256 --> 00:55:32,956
It must get out of the way!

685
00:55:33,656 --> 00:55:35,056
Don't mind me.

686
00:55:36,756 --> 00:55:38,456
Alright, wait a minute.

687
00:55:38,956 --> 00:55:41,456
Before I do my last tune,

688
00:55:41,956 --> 00:55:46,056
we gotta bring back my beautiful backing dancers, right?

689
00:55:46,756 --> 00:55:49,056
Come on! Flame on!

690
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,556
And they're back.

691
00:55:54,856 --> 00:55:56,156
Are you ready?

692
00:55:56,556 --> 00:55:57,856
Are you ready?

693
00:55:58,256 --> 00:55:59,156
Yes, yes, yes!

694
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,856
And now, for our final song,

695
00:56:02,156 --> 00:56:04,656
please listen to "Hero too".

696
00:56:05,356 --> 00:56:06,556
Hands up!

697
00:56:06,956 --> 00:56:10,156
I want to be an idol and a hero for all of you too!

698
00:56:10,456 --> 00:56:11,556
Let's go!

699
00:56:12,056 --> 00:56:14,256
Hero too
Lyrics: 夢乃ぺた (from Dizzy Sunfist) Music: 林ゆうき
Hero too
Lyrics: Peta Yumeno (from Dizzy Sunfist) Music: Yuki Hayashi

700
00:56:18,856 --> 00:56:21,456
Onwards and upwards! Huzzah!

701
00:56:23,456 --> 00:56:25,156
What am I to be?

702
00:56:25,356 --> 00:56:27,156
What is my calling?

703
00:56:27,456 --> 00:56:31,456
I gave up giving up, I'm ready to go!

704
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:34,556
Future's left unseen,

705
00:56:34,656 --> 00:56:36,356
it all depends on me.

706
00:56:36,856 --> 00:56:41,256
Put it on the line to follow my dream, yeah!

707
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,956
Tried all my life,

708
00:56:44,056 --> 00:56:46,356
I've tried to find

709
00:56:47,056 --> 00:56:51,556
something that makes me hold on and never let go.

710
00:56:54,256 --> 00:56:58,156
Hero too, I am a hero too.

711
00:56:58,756 --> 00:57:00,856
My heart is set,

712
00:57:00,956 --> 00:57:03,156
and I won't back down.

713
00:57:04,156 --> 00:57:07,956
Hero too, strength doesn't make a hero.

714
00:57:08,356 --> 00:57:12,056
True heroes stand up for what they believe,

715
00:57:12,356 --> 00:57:14,556
so wait and see.

716
00:57:15,756 --> 00:57:17,556
Yeah!

717
00:57:17,856 --> 00:57:20,056
So wait and see.

718
00:57:24,256 --> 00:57:26,156
What do they think of me?

719
00:57:26,256 --> 00:57:28,056
What do they think I'll be?

720
00:57:29,156 --> 00:57:31,056
I could not care less,

721
00:57:31,256 --> 00:57:33,056
I don't wanna know.

722
00:57:34,156 --> 00:57:36,056
Am I doing right?

723
00:57:36,156 --> 00:57:37,956
Am I satisfied?

724
00:57:38,656 --> 00:57:43,056
I wanna live my life like it's meant to be, yeah!

725
00:57:43,656 --> 00:57:45,556
Tried all my life,

726
00:57:45,756 --> 00:57:47,956
I've tried to find

727
00:57:48,656 --> 00:57:53,056
something that makes me hold on and never let go.

728
00:57:55,656 --> 00:57:59,556
Hero too, I am a hero too.

729
00:58:00,156 --> 00:58:02,356
My heart is set,

730
00:58:02,356 --> 00:58:04,556
and I won't back down.

731
00:58:05,556 --> 00:58:09,356
Hero too, strength doesn't make a hero.

732
00:58:09,756 --> 00:58:13,456
True heroes stand up for what they believe.

733
00:58:16,656 --> 00:58:20,956
People will judge for no reason at all.

734
00:58:26,756 --> 00:58:30,356
Can they might try to tear our dreams down?

735
00:58:30,656 --> 00:58:33,456
Don't listen.

736
00:58:35,156 --> 00:58:37,756
They may look down on me,

737
00:58:37,856 --> 00:58:39,356
count me out.

738
00:58:40,656 --> 00:58:44,456
I'm going my own way.

739
00:58:45,056 --> 00:58:47,556
They may look down on me,

740
00:58:47,656 --> 00:58:49,156
count me out.

741
00:58:50,056 --> 00:58:51,856
I'm a hero,

742
00:58:52,056 --> 00:58:54,556
I've got music!

743
00:58:55,556 --> 00:58:59,456
Hero too, I am a hero too.

744
00:59:00,056 --> 00:59:02,256
My heart is set,

745
00:59:02,356 --> 00:59:04,456
and I won't back down.

746
00:59:05,556 --> 00:59:09,156
Hero too, strength doesn't make a hero.

747
00:59:09,456 --> 00:59:13,056
True heroes stand up for what they believe,

748
00:59:13,356 --> 00:59:14,556
yeah I'll be.

749
00:59:14,656 --> 00:59:18,556
Hero too, I am a hero too.

750
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,256
My heart is set,

751
00:59:21,356 --> 00:59:23,956
and I won't back down, huzzah!

752
00:59:24,656 --> 00:59:28,256
Hero too, strength doesn't make a hero.

753
00:59:28,656 --> 00:59:32,256
True heroes stand up for what they believe,

754
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:34,456
so wait and see.

755
00:59:34,556 --> 00:59:38,956
I have met so many heroes in my life.

756
00:59:39,056 --> 00:59:43,756
Gave me the strength and courage to survive.

757
00:59:44,056 --> 00:59:48,756
Gave me the power to smile every day.

758
00:59:49,056 --> 00:59:54,956
Now it's my turn to be the one to make you smile.

759
01:00:00,277 --> 01:00:01,277
Yeah...

760
01:00:01,377 --> 01:00:03,777
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...

761
01:00:03,877 --> 01:00:06,077
...to make you smile!

762
01:00:09,377 --> 01:00:16,277
Yeah!

763
01:00:17,277 --> 01:00:18,777
Whoo!

764
01:00:22,617 --> 01:00:26,377
Parting is such sweet sorrow, but I will see you on the morrow.

765
01:00:26,777 --> 01:00:30,277
Make sure to eat good noms. もぐもぐ。
Make sure to eat good noms. Munch munch.

766

And get good sleeps! 寝、寝。
