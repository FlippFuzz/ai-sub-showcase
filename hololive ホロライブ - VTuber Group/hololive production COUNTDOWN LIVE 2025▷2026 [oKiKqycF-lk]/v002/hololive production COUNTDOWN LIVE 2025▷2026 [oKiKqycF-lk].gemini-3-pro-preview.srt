Whispers, banging down your window (I hear them)

322
00:24:02,145 --> 00:24:04,645
Rumors, reaching a crescendo

323
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:07,145
No humble beginnings, I'm destined for great things

I'm sure you've heard of me by now

325
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:11,945
Whoa, whoa

326
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:14,345
Midnight, drawing to the dark side (Forever)

327
00:24:14,345 --> 00:24:16,945
Daylight, take me on a joyride

328
00:24:18,145 --> 00:24:20,345
My crime is my passion

329
00:24:20,345 --> 00:24:22,145
A mayhem in action

330
00:24:22,145 --> 00:24:24,145
I know what day it is

331
00:24:24,145 --> 00:24:26,645
This is our Genesis

332
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:32,145
Start the rave when I misbehave, take center stage

333
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:36,145
Let the funk commence, bet you know I'm gonna get intense

334
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:38,345
There are loopholes unspoken

335
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:39,945
The rules can all be broken

336
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,645
I'm running on a rampage

337
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:43,145
The world is a blank page

338
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:46,645
I'm writing my story in flames and in glory

339
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:49,145
Cuz they're gonna know me by name

340
00:24:50,945 --> 00:24:51,945
Oh, oh, oh

341
00:24:51,945 --> 00:24:54,145
This mark, won't miss, will

342
00:24:54,145 --> 00:24:55,145
Oh, oh, oh

343
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:57,345
The future's in my hand

344
00:24:57,345 --> 00:24:58,345
Oh, oh, oh

345
00:24:58,345 --> 00:25:00,645
But they don't understand

346
00:25:04,053 --> 00:25:06,353
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba...

347
00:25:06,353 --> 00:25:08,253

00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:26,053
let me show you how to lose control, yeah.

353
00:25:26,053 --> 00:25:27,553
You got the key, unlock your mind.

feel the music start to rise.

361
00:25:40,153 --> 00:25:42,253
Got to break the walls and let me in.

362
00:25:42,253 --> 00:25:44,553
I know I was meant to be,

363
00:25:44,553 --> 00:25:46,253
living life so fast and free.

364
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,253
Gonna keep your eyes on me,

rumors reaching a crescendo.

369
00:25:58,053 --> 00:26:00,153

adapting, we're winning.

371
00:26:02,253 --> 00:26:04,153

勝手に一歩を踏み出した
I took a step forward on my own accord.

In today's live,

393
00:27:43,053 --> 00:27:46,153
どれの自分を見せるの？
which version of myself should I show?

394
00:27:46,153 --> 00:27:48,853
毎回こそ悩んで
Worrying about it every time,

395
00:27:48,853 --> 00:27:51,853
好きな自分になれない
I can't become the self I like.

396
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:56,553
そしてある日誰かに言われた
And then, one day someone said to me,

397
00:27:57,053 --> 00:28:02,253
「いらない言葉」なんかに迷っていた
I was getting lost in "unwanted words".

398
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:07,553
いつも作る笑顔失わないように
So I wouldn't lose the smile I always put on.

心に宿る声を聞いてみよう
Let's listen to the voice dwelling in the heart.

403

complements the other,

No time to waste!

569
00:38:45,482 --> 00:38:47,082

Oh, oh, oh

575
00:39:16,182 --> 00:39:18,682

The walls that stand in our way,

577

Fly like a feather, soaring high

距離も測りしないで 似合わないでしょう
Without even measuring the distance, it doesn't suit you, right?

593

Alright!

650
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,090
Let's show 'em what we got!

651
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,290
There's an answer out there somewhere

652
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,390
When the muses whisper truth or dare

653
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,290
The hands of fate play tug of war

654
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,090
But no one's keeping score

655
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,290
Set a course and beat the inertia

656
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,290
Cause the future is a game of chance

657
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,390
The chips are down but I'm all in

658
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:00,690
I'll play until I win!

659
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,690
I'm not gonna give up now

660
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,990
While the wheels of fortune circle back around

661
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,790
A new turn in the betting ring

662
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,890
A maze of outcomes drawn in golden string

663
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,890
And through this tangled thread...

664
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,690
...I see what's up ahead

01:16:16,587 --> 01:16:19,087
どこ見ても真っ暗な
No matter where I looked, it was pitch black,

1144
01:16:19,087 --> 01:16:21,587
場所に芽生えてた
but something sprouted in that place.

1145
01:16:22,087 --> 01:16:24,387
ほんの小さな希望に
By just a tiny hope,

1146
01:16:24,387 --> 01:16:27,087
この瞳 奪われた
my eyes were captivated.

1147
01:16:28,587 --> 01:16:30,587
不安で揺れる心を
Letting my heart, shaking with anxiety,

1148
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:33,087
うまく宇宙に逃がして
skillfully escape into space,

1149
01:16:33,087 --> 01:16:35,087
ほんの小さな勇気を
I was squeezing out

1150
01:16:36,087 --> 01:16:38,587
振り絞っていたよ
just a tiny bit of courage.

1151
01:16:40,087 --> 01:16:42,087
諦めの文字
I delete the word 'give up'

1152
01:16:42,087 --> 01:16:44,587
Deleteして進む
and move forward.

1153
01:16:44,587 --> 01:16:46,387
苦しい時も
Even in painful times,

1154
01:16:46,387 --> 01:16:48,087
もう私は
I am no longer

1155
01:16:48,087 --> 01:16:50,587
一人じゃないから
alone, so...

1156
01:16:53,087 --> 01:16:56,087
だからもっと夢 追いかけたい
That's why I want to chase the dream more!

1157
01:16:57,087 --> 01:16:59,587
ワクワク止まらない
The excitement won't stop!

1158
01:16:59,587 --> 01:17:01,587
想像を超えてく
Surpassing imagination,

1159
01:17:01,587 --> 01:17:04,087
世界 見せてあげる
I'll show you the world!

1160
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:07,587
アクセスしてみたい
I want to try accessing it.

1161
01:17:08,087 --> 01:17:10,087
後悔なんてさせない
I won't let you regret it.

1162
01:17:10,587 --> 01:17:13,587
それぞれ違った心で
With our different hearts,

1163
01:17:15,587 --> 01:17:18,587
走れば
if we run...

1164
01:17:22,587 --> 01:17:24,587
仮想の空に輝く
Shining in the virtual sky,

1165
01:17:24,587 --> 01:17:27,087
眩しい想いは
these dazzling feelings

1166
01:17:27,587 --> 01:17:30,587
見たこともない光を
will deliver a light I've never seen before

1167
01:17:30,587 --> 01:17:33,087
リアルに届けるよ
to reality.

1168
01:17:34,087 --> 01:17:36,587
いつも聞こえるエールは
I capture the cheers I always hear

1169
01:17:36,587 --> 01:17:39,087
ここにキャプチャして
right here,

1170
01:17:39,587 --> 01:17:42,087
また新しい光を
and I start wanting to search

1171
01:17:42,587 --> 01:17:44,587
探したくなるよ
for a new light again.

1172
01:17:45,587 --> 01:17:47,587
君の笑顔を
I save your smile

1173
01:17:47,587 --> 01:17:50,087
保存して進む
and move forward.

1174
01:17:50,587 --> 01:17:52,587
悲しい時に
When I'm sad, I look back at it,

1175
01:17:52,587 --> 01:17:54,587
見返すよ
because strength wells up.

1176
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:56,587
力が湧くから
Because strength wells up.

1177
01:17:59,087 --> 01:18:01,587
胸を張って夢 追いかけたい
I want to chase the dream with my head held high.

1178
01:18:02,587 --> 01:18:05,087
奇跡のストーリー
Let's create this miraculous story

1179
01:18:05,087 --> 01:18:07,087
一緒に作ろう
together.

1180
01:18:08,087 --> 01:18:10,087
終わらない夢を
An unending dream...

1181
01:18:11,087 --> 01:18:13,587
誰一人欠かせない
No one is indispensable.

1182
01:18:14,587 --> 01:18:16,587
愛が埋まったこの世界
In this world filled with love,

1183
01:18:16,587 --> 01:18:19,587
それぞれ違った心で
with our different hearts,

1184
01:18:21,587 --> 01:18:24,587
彩れ
Color it in!

1185
01:18:33,587 --> 01:18:35,587
悲しい時も
Even in sad times,

1186
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:38,587
寂しい時も
even in lonely times,

1187
01:18:39,587 --> 01:18:43,087
信じ合えるものがある
there is something we can believe in together.

1188
01:18:44,587 --> 01:18:46,087
忘れずに
Don't forget,

1189
01:18:46,087 --> 01:18:47,587
この鼓動
I want to keep ringing

1190
01:18:47,587 --> 01:18:50,087
鳴らし続けたい
this heartbeat.

1191
01:18:50,587 --> 01:18:53,087
終わらない世界に
In the unending world,

1192
01:18:53,587 --> 01:18:55,087
溢れ出すよ
they overflow...

1193
01:18:55,587 --> 01:18:57,587
笑顔たち
these smiles.

1194
01:18:59,087 --> 01:19:01,587
憧れの舞台 立ちたい
I want to stand on the stage of my dreams.

1195
01:19:02,587 --> 01:19:05,087
まっすぐ輝きたい
I want to shine straight and true.

1196
01:19:05,587 --> 01:19:07,087
時に涙して
Sometimes shedding tears,

1197
01:19:08,087 --> 01:19:09,587
また笑い合いたい
I want to laugh together again.

1198
01:19:10,587 --> 01:19:13,087
同じ未来を見たい
I want to see the same future.

1199
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:16,087
あの夢 手にしたい
I want to grasp that dream.

01:19:16,587 --> 01:19:18,587
踏み出そう
Let's step forward,

1201
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,587
奇跡の一歩を
taking that miraculous first step.

1202
01:19:23,087 --> 01:19:25,587
息切らして夢 追いかけたい
Out of breath, I want to chase the dream.

1203
01:19:27,087 --> 01:19:29,587
ワクワク止まらない
The excitement won't stop!

1204
01:19:29,587 --> 01:19:31,587
想像を超えてく
Surpassing imagination,

1205

01:19:41,587 --> 01:19:44,087
それぞれ違った心で
With our different hearts,

1209
01:19:44,587 --> 01:19:47,587
作るの
we create it!

1210
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:14,875
みんな、コークは持ったかな？
Does everyone have their Coke?

1211
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:16,075
持ちました！乾杯するー！
Got it! Let's toast!

1212
01:20:17,075 --> 01:20:18,075
こらこら！
Hey, hey!

1213
01:20:18,075 --> 01:20:19,275
あー！早いよラプちゃん！
Ah! Too early, Lap-chan!

1214
01:20:19,275 --> 01:20:19,875
避けるな！
Don't dodge!

1215
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:20,575
当たるぅ！
It's gonna hit!

1216
01:20:20,575 --> 01:20:22,775
年越しのタイミングでみんなで乾杯ってするんだよ！
We're all supposed to toast at the moment the year changes!

1217
01:20:22,775 --> 01:20:25,275
やだやだ！もう喉カラカラ！
No way! I'm already super thirsty!

1218
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:26,875
楽しみだね！
Can't wait, right?

1219
01:20:27,075 --> 01:20:28,875
ね？みこさん？…みこさん？
Right, Miko-san? ...Miko-san?

1220
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:31,775
いや～いいライブだったね～
Man, that was a great concert.

1221
01:20:31,775 --> 01:20:32,775
おつかれ～
Good work~

1222
01:20:32,775 --> 01:20:33,375
イェ～イ
Yaay.

1223
01:20:33,575 --> 01:20:34,875
この後どうする？
What do we do after this?

1224
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:35,875
ご飯食べる？
Want to get food?

1225
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:37,575
いや、どこも混んでるんじゃない？
Nah, everywhere's probably crowded, right?

1226
01:20:37,575 --> 01:20:38,375
確かに。
True.

1227
01:20:38,775 --> 01:20:40,075
もう帰りますかね。
Guess we'll just head home.

1228
01:20:40,775 --> 01:20:42,575
あ、運転手さん、まっすぐね。
Ah, driver, go straight please.

1229
01:20:42,575 --> 01:20:43,475
ブゥー。
(Grunt)

1230
01:20:44,175 --> 01:20:45,175
おい！
Hey!

1231
01:20:45,175 --> 01:20:45,875
お前ら！
You guys!

1232
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:46,875
何 帰ってんだ！
Why are you going home?!

1233
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,575
乾杯！乾杯！
Toast! Toast!

1234
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:50,175
フブちゃん達がついて来てる！
Fubu-chan and the others are following us!

1235
01:20:50,175 --> 01:20:52,875
あらあらフブさん寂しくなっちゃったのかね？
Oh my, Fubu-san must have gotten lonely without us.

1236
01:20:52,875 --> 01:20:54,075
待てー！
Waaait!

1237
01:20:54,075 --> 01:20:55,175
なんか怒ってない？
Doesn't she seem angry?

1238
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:55,975
え？
Eh?

1239
01:20:56,175 --> 01:20:57,375
あ、やばい。
Ah, crap.

1240
01:20:57,375 --> 01:20:58,975
あの悪戯バレたかな。
She might have found out about that prank.

1241
01:20:58,975 --> 01:21:00,875
やりすぎだったかも～！
We might have overdone it~!

1242
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:02,175
やばいかも！
This might be bad!

1243
01:21:02,175 --> 01:21:03,375
運転手さんごめん！
Driver, sorry!

1244
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:05,575
おっ、おお～
Whoa, whoa~

1245
01:21:06,175 --> 01:21:07,775
みこのドラテクで逃げるぞ！
I'll escape with Miko's driving technique!

1246
01:21:07,775 --> 01:21:08,975
ワオ！ワオ！
Wow! Wow!

1247
01:21:09,475 --> 01:21:10,475
あ！来た！
Ah! They're here!

1248
01:21:11,775 --> 01:21:12,875
危ねぇ！
Watch out!

1249
01:21:12,875 --> 01:21:13,875
すごいすごい！
Amazing, amazing!

1250
01:21:18,175 --> 01:21:19,875
フブさんごめんて！
Fubu-san, I said sorry!

1251
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,375
もう悪戯しないから！
I won't pull any more pranks!

1252
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:22,875
だめだよみこみこ、反省しなさい。
No good, MikoMiko. Reflect on your actions.

1253
01:21:22,875 --> 01:21:24,075
お前も共犯だろうが！
You were an accomplice too!

1254
01:21:24,075 --> 01:21:25,375
何の話だよ～。
What are you talking about~

1255
01:21:26,575 --> 01:21:27,875
二人ともこれ持って。
You two, hold this.

1256
01:21:27,875 --> 01:21:28,875
何するの？
What are we doing?

1257
01:21:28,875 --> 01:21:30,875
もうすぐ新年だよ！
It's almost the New Year!

1258
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:32,875

ごくごくいっぱい！
Gulp gulp, full up!

1274
01:21:52,675 --> 01:21:54,175
そういえば、悪戯ってなんなの？
By the way, what was the prank?

1275
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:55,175
あ、それね。
Ah, that.

1276
01:21:55,175 --> 01:21:56,875
フブキさんのへそ、増やしたんだよ。
I increased Fubuki-san's belly buttons.

1277
01:21:57,175 --> 01:21:57,975
恐怖！
The horror!

1278
01:21:57,975 --> 01:21:59,675
このあとは、コカ・コーラと一緒に
Up next, with Coca-Cola,

1279
01:21:59,675 --> 01:22:01,175
スペシャルライブステージ！
it's a Special Live Stage!

1280
01:22:01,175 --> 01:22:02,575
イェーイ！
Yeaaah!

1281
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:28,775
そうさずっと僕らの軌跡が
Yes, so that our miracle

1282
01:22:29,575 --> 01:22:32,475
途切れないように歌うんだ
Will never be broken, we sing

1283
01:22:32,475 --> 01:22:34,575
もっと高く
Higher,

1284
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:37,575
大きな声で
With a louder voice

1285
01:22:51,775 --> 01:22:55,675
聞こえてた何かが始まるサイン
I could hear it, the sign that something is starting

1286
01:22:56,775 --> 01:23:00,575
集まって気づけば鼓動奏でた
Gathering together, before we knew it, our heartbeats played a tune

1287
01:23:01,775 --> 01:23:06,475
夢に見るだけじゃもう足りないでしょ
Just dreaming about it isn't enough anymore, right?

1288
01:23:07,475 --> 01:23:11,475
君を待ってる世界があるよ
There's a world waiting for you

1289
01:23:13,475 --> 01:23:17,575
楽しい予感にほら飛び乗っちゃえばいい
Just jump into that fun premonition, come on

1290
01:23:18,575 --> 01:23:21,975
トキメキは止められないから
Because this excitement can't be stopped

1291
01:23:23,775 --> 01:23:27,275
明日を連れていくよ光の真ん中
I'll take tomorrow with me, into the center of the light

1292
01:23:30,775 --> 01:23:33,975
夢の先へ羽ばたける
We can fly to what lies beyond the dream

1293
01:23:34,675 --> 01:23:36,775
勇気は君の願い
Courage is your wish

1294
01:23:38,075 --> 01:23:41,675
みんなで繋いだこの奇跡が
This miracle we connected together

1295
01:23:42,575 --> 01:23:45,575
途切れないように歌うんだ
We sing so it won't be broken

01:23:45,575 --> 01:23:47,475
もっと高く
Higher,

1297
01:23:47,475 --> 01:23:50,675
大きな声で
With a louder voice

1298
01:24:04,275 --> 01:24:08,575
答えとか理屈に惑わされて
Confused by answers and logic

1299
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:13,675
彷徨っても戻ってこれる場所があったんだ
Even if I wandered, there was a place I could return to

1300
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:19,175
自由な道ゆく僕らの旅
Our journey goes along a free path

1301
01:24:20,275 --> 01:24:24,475
願いだけが道標だよ
