Ready, set, go, let's do this! Watch me, watch me, watch me...

309
00:23:16,745 --> 00:23:22,645
...watch me be a diva, I'm gonna raise your fever, shaking up all the crowd

310
00:23:22,745 --> 00:23:25,645
Making some noise when I'm not allowed, living my life out loud

311
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:29,645
I have awakened to wisdom beyond understanding

312
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:32,645
I keep on doubting in my anthem

313
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,645
Oh, don't blame me if I shine too bright

314
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:39,645
Oh, can't help it if I start a fire

315
00:23:39,745 --> 00:23:44,645
Oh, pay attention to me, 'cause this is only the beginning

316
00:23:44,745 --> 00:23:46,645
It's our Genesis!

317
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:50,645
Coming to wreak some havoc, how do you like this badness?

318
00:23:50,745 --> 00:23:53,645
I'm embracing my madness, can you hear it?

319
00:23:53,745 --> 00:23:56,645
Whispers bang around your window (Advent! Advent!)

320
00:23:56,745 --> 00:23:59,645
Rumors reaching a crescendo (Advent! Advent!)

321
00:23:59,745 --> 00:24:02,645
No humble beginning, I'm destined for great things

322
00:24:02,745 --> 00:24:06,645
I'm sure you've heard of me by now, woah!

323
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,645
Midnight, diamonds in the dark side (Advent! Advent!)

324
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:13,645
Starlight, take me on a joyride (Advent! Advent!)

325
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:16,645
My crime is my passion, I'm mayhem in action

326
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:20,645
I know what day it is, this is our Genesis!

327
00:24:20,745 --> 00:24:25,645
I enjoy the rage when I misbehave, take center stage

328
00:24:25,745 --> 00:24:31,645
Let the funk commence, but you know I'm gonna get intense

329
00:24:31,745 --> 00:24:34,645
There are loopholes I'm smoking, the rules can all be broken

330
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:37,645
I'm running on a rampage, the world is a blank page

331
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:41,645
I'm writing my story in flames and in glory

332
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:45,645
And they're gonna know me by name, some more!

333
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:48,645
Oh, this my promised land

334
00:24:48,745 --> 00:24:52,645
Oh, the future's in my hands

335
00:24:52,745 --> 00:25:03,645
Oh, they don't understand that I'm a star in the making, awaking, awaking!

336
00:25:04,053 --> 00:25:05,853
Bow bow bow bow...

337
00:25:05,853 --> 00:25:07,653
Tell me how you like me now.

338
00:25:14,653 --> 00:25:17,553
Let's celebrate the new year!

339
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:21,653
Watch me, watch me, watch me.

340
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,853
Let your voice go up and show you how to lose control.

341
00:25:24,853 --> 00:25:26,553
You've got to free your mind,

342
00:25:26,553 --> 00:25:28,653
leave your base behind.

343
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,353
Be outrageous,

344
00:25:30,353 --> 00:25:31,853
the chaos is contagious.

345
00:25:31,853 --> 00:25:33,853
Come on, you know what time it is!

346
00:25:33,853 --> 00:25:35,853
IT'S OUR GENESIS!

347
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:37,653
Time to open up your eyes,

348
00:25:37,653 --> 00:25:39,353
feel the music start to rise,

349
00:25:39,353 --> 00:25:41,853
got to shake the world and let me in.

350
00:25:42,353 --> 00:25:44,153
I know what I was meant to be,

351
00:25:44,153 --> 00:25:46,053
living life so fast and free,

352
00:25:46,053 --> 00:25:47,653
try to keep your eyes on me,

353
00:25:47,653 --> 00:25:49,553
this is our beginning!

354
00:25:49,553 --> 00:25:51,353
IT'S OUR GENESIS!

355
00:25:51,353 --> 00:25:54,053
Whispers banging down your window,

356
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,653
rumors reaching a crescendo.

357
00:25:57,653 --> 00:25:59,553
No humble beginning,

358
00:25:59,553 --> 00:26:01,653
a death-defying bracing,

359
00:26:01,653 --> 00:26:03,853
I'm sure you've heard of me by now.

360
00:26:05,353 --> 00:26:07,353
Tonight join me to the bright side,

361
00:26:08,353 --> 00:26:11,553
day white take me on a joy ride.

362
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:13,553
My crime is my passion,

363
00:26:13,553 --> 00:26:15,353
a mayhem in action.

364
00:26:15,353 --> 00:26:17,353

IT'S OUR GENESIS!

372
00:26:29,653 --> 00:26:31,053
Tell me what time it is,

本日のライブでは
In today's live performance,

382
00:27:42,653 --> 00:27:45,353
どれの自分を見せるの
which side of myself will I show?

383
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:48,053
前からそう悩んで
I've been worrying like that for a while,

384
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:50,853
好きな自分になれない
unable to become the self I like

385
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:55,653
そしてある日誰かに言われた
And then one day, someone told me something

386
00:27:55,653 --> 00:28:00,553
痛い言葉なんかに迷っていた
I was lost in some painful words

387
00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:07,053
いつも作る笑顔失わないように
To make sure I don't lose the smile I always put on

388
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:10,653
これ以上は期待を
I decided I won't

389
00:28:10,653 --> 00:28:13,153
裏切らないと決めた
disappoint expectations any further

390
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:16,653
溢れている
Amidst the

391
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,553
雑音の中
overflowing noise,

392
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:22,053
この声響けるか
can this voice resound?

393
00:28:24,353 --> 00:28:30,153
心に宿る声を聞いてみよう
Let's try listening to the voice dwelling in our hearts

394
00:28:30,153 --> 00:28:36,553
これはずっと見せたい自分だから
Because this is the self I've always wanted to show

少しだけ怖くなった
I've become a little bit scared

401
00:29:07,553 --> 00:29:10,153
でもね一人じゃない
But you know, I'm not alone,

402
00:29:10,153 --> 00:29:12,853
仲間たちがいるんだ
my friends are here

家族みたいな絆で
With bonds like family,

違いが分かり合えた
we could understand our differences

405
00:29:19,353 --> 00:29:22,053
それぞれの
Each person has

406
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:24,153
輝きがあって
their own brilliance,

407
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:28,153
ハーモニー奏でるかな
so will we play a harmony?

408
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:32,553

Holding hands together

We'll deliver happiness

You're interested in others besides me, aren't you?

Lyrics: Yoshifumi Kanamaru (onetrap)
Composition/Arrangement: Ryota Nakano (onetrap)

1005
01:16:16,887 --> 01:16:21,087
どこ見ても真っ暗な場所に芽生えていた
It budded in a place where everything was pitch black

1006
01:16:21,287 --> 01:16:26,487
ほんの小さな希望にこの瞳奪われた
My eyes were captivated by a tiny speck of hope

1007
01:16:27,287 --> 01:16:31,687
不安で揺れる心をうまくチューニングして
Tuning my heart that wavers with anxiety

1008
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:37,487
ほんの小さな勇気を振り絞っていたんだよ
I was squeezing out a tiny bit of courage

1009
01:16:39,587 --> 01:16:43,787
あきらめの文字手放して進む
Letting go of the word "surrender" as I move forward

1010
01:16:44,387 --> 01:16:51,587
苦しい時も　もう私は一人じゃないから
Because even in painful times, I'm not alone anymore

1011
01:16:52,587 --> 01:16:55,987
だからこそ夢追いかけたい
That's why I want to chase my dreams

1012
01:16:56,187 --> 01:16:58,287
ワクワク止まらない
The excitement won't stop

1013
01:16:58,587 --> 01:17:03,187
想像超えていく世界見せてあげる
I'll show you a world that exceeds your imagination

1014
01:17:03,887 --> 01:17:07,087
アクセスしてみたい
I want to try accessing it

1015
01:17:07,287 --> 01:17:09,987
後悔なんてさせない
I won't let you have any regrets

1016
01:17:10,287 --> 01:17:18,587
それぞれ違った心で走り出そう
Let's start running with our different hearts

1017
01:17:22,087 --> 01:17:26,987
空想の空に輝く眩しい想いは
The dazzling feelings shining in the imaginary sky

1018
01:17:27,387 --> 01:17:32,687
見たことのない光をリアルに届けるよ
Will deliver a light you've never seen to reality

1019
01:17:33,487 --> 01:17:37,887
いつも聞こえるエールはここにキャプチャーして
Capturing the cheers I always hear right here

1020
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:43,487
また新しい光を探したくなるよ
It makes me want to search for new light again

1021
01:17:45,587 --> 01:17:49,987
君の笑顔は綻びて進む
Your smile blooms as we advance

1022
01:17:50,487 --> 01:17:56,987
悲しい時に見返すよ　力が沸くから
I'll look back at it when I'm sad, because it gives me strength

1023
01:17:58,587 --> 01:18:01,587
胸を張って夢追いかけたい
I want to chase my dreams with pride

1024
01:18:01,887 --> 01:18:06,787
奇跡のストーリー一緒に作ろう
Let's create a miracle story together

1025
01:18:07,687 --> 01:18:12,587
終わらない夢を　誰一人欠かさない
An unending dream, without missing a single person

1026
01:18:13,087 --> 01:18:16,087
曖昧なこの世界
In this vague world

1027
01:18:16,587 --> 01:18:24,587
それぞれ違った心で彩れ
Paint it with our different hearts

1028
01:18:33,387 --> 01:18:36,387
楽しい時も
In happy times

1029
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:39,587
寂しい時も
In lonely times

1030
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:43,787
信じ合えるものがある
There's something we can believe in together

1031
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:48,987
結び目にこの鼓動鳴らし続けたい
I want to keep this heartbeat sounding at the knot

1032
01:18:49,687 --> 01:18:57,187
モノクロな世界に溢れ出すよ　絵具たち
The paints are overflowing into the monochrome world

1033
01:18:58,287 --> 01:19:01,587
憧れの舞台立ちたい
I want to stand on the stage I admire

1034
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:04,587
真っ直ぐ輝きたい
I want to shine straightforwardly

1035
01:19:04,987 --> 01:19:09,987
時に涙してまた笑い合いたい
Sometimes crying, and wanting to laugh together again

1036
01:19:10,887 --> 01:19:13,587
同じ未来を見ていたい
I want to see the same future

1037
01:19:13,787 --> 01:19:16,587
あの夢手にしたい
I want to grasp that dream

1038
01:19:16,887 --> 01:19:21,987
踏み出そう奇跡の一歩を
Let's take a miracle step forward

1039
01:19:23,087 --> 01:19:26,587
息切らして夢追いかけたい
Out of breath, I want to chase my dreams

1040
01:19:26,787 --> 01:19:28,687
ワクワク止まらない
The excitement won't stop

1041
01:19:28,987 --> 01:19:33,587
想像超えていく世界見せてあげる
I'll show you a world that exceeds your imagination

1042
01:19:34,287 --> 01:19:37,287
アクセスしてみな
Try accessing it

1043
01:19:37,487 --> 01:19:40,287
後悔なんてここにない
There are no regrets here

1044
01:19:40,587 --> 01:19:49,587
それぞれ違った心でつくろう
Let's create it with our different hearts

1045
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:14,875
みんな、コークは持ったかな？
Everyone, do you have your Cokes?

1046
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:16,875
準備した！乾杯するー！

We're all going to toast together at the turn of the year.

1050
01:20:23,375 --> 01:20:25,375
やだやだ、もう喉カラカラ。
No, no, my throat is already parched.

1051
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:26,875
楽しみだね。
I'm looking forward to it.

1052
01:20:26,875 --> 01:20:27,875
ねぇ、みこさん。みこさん？

おつかれー。イェーイ。
Good job. Yay.

1055
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:36,375
この後どうする？ご飯食べる？
What should we do now? Want to eat?

1056
01:20:36,375 --> 01:20:37,875
いやー、どこも混んでんじゃない？
Well, everywhere's probably crowded, right?

1057
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,875
確かに。もう帰りますかね。
True. Should we just head home?

1058
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:41,875
あ、運転手さん、まっすぐね。
Oh, driver, go straight, please.

1059

フブちゃんたちがついてきてる。
Fubu-chan and the others are following us.

1064
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:52,875

Oh dear, maybe Fubusu got lonely too.

1065
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:54,375
待てー！
Wait!

1066
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:55,875
なんか怒ってない？
Don't they seem kind of angry?

1067
01:20:55,875 --> 01:20:58,375
おえ？あ、やばい。あのいたずらバレたかな？
Eh? Oh no. Did they find out about that prank?

1068
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:00,875
あはは。やりすぎだったかなぁ。
Ahaha. Maybe we went too far.

1069
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:02,875
やばいかも。運転手さん、ごめん。
This might be bad. Driver, sorry.

I'm sorry Fubu-chan, I won't play pranks anymore.

1078
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,375
だめだよみこみこ、反省しなさい。
No good, MikoMiko, reflect on what you've done.

1079
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:23,875
お前も共犯だろうが！
You were an accomplice too!

1080
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:25,375
何の話だ。おい。
What are you talking about? Hey.

1081

二人ともこれ持って。
Both of you, take this.

1082
01:21:28,875 --> 01:21:29,875
何するの？
What are we doing?
