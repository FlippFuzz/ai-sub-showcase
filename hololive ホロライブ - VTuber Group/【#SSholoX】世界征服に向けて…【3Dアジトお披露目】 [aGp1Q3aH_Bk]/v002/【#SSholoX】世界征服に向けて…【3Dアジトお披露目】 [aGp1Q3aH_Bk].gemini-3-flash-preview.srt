2
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,200
履いて捨てるような現実は
A reality that can be discarded

3
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,300
一刀両断、叩き斬る！
I'll cut it down with one stroke!

4
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,800
終わりなき輪廻に迷いし子らよ。
Oh, children lost in endless samsara.

5
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,500
漆黒の翼で誘おう。
I shall invite you with pitch-black wings.

6
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,300
我らエデンの星を統べる者、
We are the rulers of the planet Eden,

7
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,500
秘密結社...
The secret society...

8
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,500
holoXでござる！
is holoX!

9
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,800
皆の者、かかれ！
Everyone, attack!

10
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,200
Yes My Dark!

11
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,500
イエーーーイ！！
YAAAY!!

12
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,100
どうだ貴様ら！最高にカッコよかっただろう！
How was it, you scoundrels? We were super cool, right?!

13
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,000
めちゃくちゃよかったよね！
That was incredibly good, wasn't it?!

14
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,300
合図決まった！
The cue was perfect!

15
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,300
最高！
Awesome!

16
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
初めて決まった！
We nailed it for the first time!

17
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,100
ちゃんと練習した甲斐があったね。
It was really worth practicing properly.

18
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,500
甲斐があったぞ！
It was definitely worth it!

19
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
甲斐があった～！
It was worth it~!

20
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,100
そしてここが、我らのアジトだ！
And here is our hideout!

21
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,000
イエーーーイ！ジャジャーン！
YAAAY! Ta-da!

22
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,800
え、待って。秘密結社なのにアジトを公開していいのかい？
Wait, is it okay to reveal our hideout even though we're a secret society?

23
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,500
いいの！
It's fine!

24
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,150
いいの！
It's fine!

25
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,700
いいの！
It's fine!

26
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,100
いいの！窓ないからね！
It's fine! Because there are no windows!

27
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,300
そうだよ。あのエロい奴しかないから。
Exactly. We only have that sexy thing.

28
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,700
エロいピンクの奴しかないから！
We only have that sexy pink thing!

29
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,500
あの明かりちょっとエロい...
That light is a bit sexy...

30
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,800
確かに、それはある。
That's true, actually.

31
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,500
吾輩はね、結構住み心地良くて気に入ってるよ。
As for me, it's quite comfortable to live in and I like it.

32
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,100
じゃ、色々紹介したいところはあるんだけれども、
Well, there are many things we want to introduce,

We definitely want to!

44
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,900
ぐるぐるぐるぐる...どこから行こうかな？
Spinning around... where should we start?

45
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,500
じゃあ、吾輩のソファ！吾輩のソファ！
Then, my sofa! My sofa!

46
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,700
あ、吾輩のソファ。
Ah, her sofa.

47
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,400
めっちゃいい椅子座ってる！
She's sitting in a really nice chair!

48
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,600
見て見て！
Look, look!

49
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,500
吾輩、椅子も持ってるし、ソファも持ってるし、
I have a chair, and a sofa,

50
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,800
で、カラスもいるんだよ。
and there's a crow too.

51
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,200
カラスもいるんだ。
There's a crow too.

52
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,800
ダーツで遊んでんの。
I play with darts.

53
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,800
あ、そうだ！できんの？ダーツ。
Oh, right! Can you actually play darts?

54
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,000
できんの？
Can you?

55
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,600
でも遊んでるとこ見たことない。
But I've never seen you playing.

56
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,400
うるさい黙れ！いいの！イマジナリーダーツ！
Shut up! It's fine! Imaginary darts!

57
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,800
次々！博士のを見よう！
Next, next! Let's see the Doctor's!

58
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,000
あ、こよりのところは、ここです！
Ah, Koyori's place is right here!

59
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,074
ええ、すごい！
Whoa, amazing!

60
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:02,174
いいじゃん、可愛い！
It's nice and cute!

61
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:05,441
地図も飾ってあるし、ゲーミングチェア！
There's a map on the wall, and a gaming chair!

62
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:08,841
いつもね、頭抱えながら頑張ってるよ、ここで。
I'm always working hard here, holding my head.

63
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:13,174
たまにここが爆発するけど、みんな気にしないで。優しい。
Sometimes this place explodes, but everyone is kind enough not to mind.

64
00:05:13,174 --> 00:05:14,641
可愛いー！
So cute!

65
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:16,174
端っこにしたからね。
I put it in the corner.

66
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:18,441
まあ、我が輩被ってるけど。
Well, it's overlapping with me though.

67
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:20,108
まあ、ラプラスならいっか。
Well, if it's Laplus, it's fine.

68
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:22,074
どういう扱いだよ！ふざけんな！
What's with that treatment?! Don't mess with me!

69
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:23,141
じゃあ次行くか。
Well, shall we go to the next one?

70
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:24,408
うん！
Yeah!

71
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,174
はーい！
Okay!

72
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:28,274
ここはドーン！
And here is... Ta-da!

73
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:30,008
幹部だ！
It's the Executive's area!

74
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:32,408
そう、私のね、キッチン。愛用してるキッチンですね。
Yes, it's my kitchen. The kitchen I use regularly.

75
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:35,441
まあ幹部室はね、また2階とかにあるんだけれども。
Well, the executive room is on the second floor, but...

76
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:41,374
ここでね、みんなの、まあご飯だったりとか、ラプラスに向けてね、ハンバーグなど作っています。
Here, I make rice for everyone, and things like Hamburg steak for Laplus.

77
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,074
ハンバーグ！
Hamburg steak!

78
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:44,208
ハンバーグ！
Hamburg steak!

79
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,874
ガムもある、ガムもね。
I also have gum, you see.

80
00:05:45,874 --> 00:05:47,541
ハンバーグ食べようね。
Let's eat Hamburg steak.

81
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,041
生姜焼きも！
And ginger pork too!

82
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,141
お上手！
You're so good!

83
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,074
いっぱいいっぱい。そして...
So many things. And...

84
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:53,308
ここに行くと...
If you go here...

85
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:57,441
見て見て！沙花叉のお掃除道具が飾られてます！
Look, look! Sakamata's cleaning tools are on display!

86
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,841
できんの？
Can you actually do it?

87
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:00,608
掃除するもの違くない？
Aren't the things you clean different?

88
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:03,474
掃除してるとこ見たことないんだけど。
I've never seen you clean anything before.

89
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:06,141
ちゃんと掃除屋さんだからね、お掃除なんですけど。
I'm a proper cleaner, so of course I clean.

90
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:12,074
あとあの、拘束テープ貼ってあるので、皆さん覗かないでください。上のね、段ボールとか見ないでね。
Also, there's caution tape, so please don't peek. Don't look at the cardboard boxes on top!

91
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:16,474
でも掃除してるとこ見たことないよ。
But we've never seen you clean.

92
00:06:16,474 --> 00:06:18,074
ダメダメ、見たことないよ。
No, no, I've never seen it either.

93
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:19,474
次、侍でござる。
Next is the samurai.

94
00:06:19,474 --> 00:06:23,108
まあ風真は荷物少ないでござるからな。
Well, Kazama has very little luggage.

95
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:24,441
いや本当に！
Seriously!

96
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:26,174
本当にね！
Really, right!

97
00:06:26,174 --> 00:06:28,174
片付いてるわ。
It's so tidy.

98
00:06:28,174 --> 00:06:29,174
ナスじゃ！
It's an eggplant!

99
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:30,274
ナス！
Eggplant!

100
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:31,441
ナス、ごはん、ごはん。
Eggplant, food, food.

101
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:34,141
ナスはごはんでござる。
Eggplant is food.

102
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:37,041
え、これ今日食べるやつだよね？今日料理するやつ。
Wait, this is the one you're eating today, right? The one for cooking today.

103
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:40,174
冷蔵庫にしまっとけばいいじゃん。
You should just put it in the fridge.

104
00:06:40,174 --> 00:06:43,074
まあね、あの、すぐ取り出せるように生であそこに置いてあるでござる。
Well, it's placed there raw so I can take it out and eat it immediately.

105
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:44,208
やめてー！
Stop it!

106
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,641
生？！
Raw?!

107
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:47,174
あとぽこべぇ！
And Pokobe!

108
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,574
ぽこべぇー！
Pokobe!

109
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,408
招き猫みたいになってる。
It looks like a maneki-neko.

110
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:53,341
福が訪れるからね。置いてあります。
It's there because it brings good luck.

111
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:55,208
あと帯の予備とかも置いてあるでござる。
Also, I have a spare obi placed there.

112
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,574
可愛い！
Cute!

113
00:06:56,574 --> 00:06:57,674
可愛い！
So cute!

114
00:06:57,674 --> 00:06:59,208
これこれ、これ！
This, this, this one!

115
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,308
幹部の鞭と一緒に置いてあるんだよね。
It's placed together with the Executive's whip.

116
00:07:01,308 --> 00:07:02,408
あー、えっち！
Oh, that's erotic!

117
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:04,274
えっちだなぁ。
How sexy.

118
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:07,508
こんな感じになってます、皆さんどうですか？
It's like this, everyone. How is it?

119
00:07:07,508 --> 00:07:11,441
なんかいつもはこんな感じだけど...あ、いつもじゃねえわ、今日はこんな感じだけど。
It's usually like this... no, it's like this today, but...

120
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:14,374
いつもはもっと違うんだよ。
It's usually much different.

121
00:07:14,374 --> 00:07:18,441
この辺にいろいろ置いてあるのを今日撤去したんだよ。
I moved various things that are usually around here for today.

122
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:20,308
片付けたでござる。
We tidied up.

123
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:21,441
今日のためにね。
For today's sake.

124
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,241
いつものやつ見て、せーの！
Take a look at how it usually is. Ready...!

125
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:25,141
どうぞ！
Ta-da!

126
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:27,474
わあー！
Whoa!

127
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:29,574
いつもこのソファで寝てる。
I'm always sleeping on this sofa.

128
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,808
くつろいでるね。
You're really relaxing.

129
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:33,174
なんか真ん中片付けておけばよかったね。
Maybe we should have tidied up the middle.

130
00:07:33,174 --> 00:07:34,274
コーラだ、コーラ！
Coke! There's a Coke!

131
00:07:34,274 --> 00:07:36,174
うるさい、うるさい！いいんだよ！
Shut up, shut up! It's fine!

132
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:39,308
なんか出しっぱなしのやつに言われたくないんだよ。
I don't want to hear that from someone who leaves things out.

133
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:41,241
いいだろ別に！
Who cares! It's fine!

134
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,274
まあ誰が食べてるかすぐわかるな。
Well, you can tell immediately who's eating what.

135
00:07:44,274 --> 00:07:46,074
うるさいなぁ。あ、そうだ、今日のハッシュタグ！
You're so annoying. Oh, right, today's hashtag!

136
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:51,374
#SSholoX！
#SSholoX!

137
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:55,141
うるさい！というわけで。
Shut up! Anyway...

138
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:59,208
えっと、我々がね、この6月でどんどん3Dお披露目していってだな。
So, we've all been having our 3D debuts this June.

139
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:04,274
世界征服に向けて一歩前進したってことなんですけども。
And we've taken a step forward toward world conquest.

140
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:10,274
いっぽ、いっぽ！侍、成果どうだった？
One step, one step! Samurai, how was the result?

141
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:12,308
お、凄楽しかった！
Oh, it was really fun!

142
00:08:12,308 --> 00:08:15,141
そういうことじゃないだろう！
That's not what I meant!

143
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:17,341
喜んでもらえて。
People were happy.

144
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:20,141
我が輩に報告しろっつーの！
I said, report to me!

145
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:24,274
見てた、見てたけど、やっぱ本人の口から聞かないと。
We saw it, we did, but we need to hear it from you.

146
00:08:24,274 --> 00:08:26,174
じゃあ侍から、はい！
Alright then, samurai! Go!

147
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:28,174
いろはから。行きます！
From Iroha. Here I go!

148
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,241
お！映像がある！
Oh! There's a video!

149
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:33,441
ファイル1、おー！
File 001, oh!

150
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:36,574
これなんか公式番組で見たやつ！
I saw this on an official program!

151
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:39,141
懐かしい！かっこいい！
So nostalgic! And cool!

152
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:41,274
いっちょーたい！ヘイヘイ！
One-two, showtime! Hey, hey!

153
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:44,208
ヘイヘイ！いろは！
Hey, hey! Iroha!

154
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,074
あ、出た、出た！大きい！
Oh, there he is! He's big!

155
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:48,341
今からぽこべぇ、ぽこべぇだよこれ！
Here comes Pokobe, it's Pokobe!

156
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:51,374
ぽこべぇ3Dお披露目！
It's Pokobe's 3D debut!

157
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:53,308
風真いろはでござるー！
It's Kazama Iroha!

158
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:56,274
これ、これ、これが黒井なんじゃないかって言われてたやつ。
This is the one people were saying was Kuroi.

159
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:58,308
くらえー！
Take this!

160
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:01,308
かっこいいー！殺陣！
So cool! Action scene!

161
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:05,574
今のやつ、黒井だよな？
The one just now was Kuroi, right?

162
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:08,574
嘘だー！誰と戦ったの？
Lies! Who were you fighting?

163
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:12,308
誠に対戦ありがとうございました！
Thank you very much for the match!

164
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:15,441
おいおい、おいおい！
Hey, hey!

165
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:18,241
待って、待って！
Wait, wait!

166
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:23,174
まあでもね、3D配信でも終始動きっぱなしで風真らしさが見せられたんじゃないかなって。
But I think I was able to show Kazama's style in the 3D stream, moving around the whole time.

167
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:25,574
いや、めちゃくちゃかっこよかったよ！
Yeah, it was really cool!

168
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:28,274
体幹の強さね、見せられたんじゃないかなと思っております。
I think I was able to show the strength of my core.

169
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:30,141
かっこよかった、美しかったよ！
It was cool and beautiful!

170
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:32,441
剣舞もめっちゃ綺麗だったし。
The sword dance was also very pretty.

171
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:34,574
あとサラランっていうやつもさ！
And the 'Sararan' part too!

172
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,141
サラランスね、サラランス。
Sararansu, right? Sararansu.

173
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:39,308
前見えなかったけど、すごいいかった！
I couldn't see well from the front, but it was great!

174
00:09:39,308 --> 00:09:42,574
ありがとうございます。まだ見てない方はぜひ見てください！
Thank you! If you haven't seen it yet, please do!

00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:44,208
ぜひぜひ！
Please do!

176
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,308
じゃあなんかさっきお披露目した新人どうだった？
Well, how about the rookie who just debuted earlier?

177
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:50,574
ねえ、新人じゃないの！あれは沙花叉なの！
Hey, I'm not a rookie! That's Sakamata!

178
00:09:50,574 --> 00:09:54,174
もう、ちゃんとした沙花叉の見てください、どうぞ！
Please watch the proper Sakamata one. Here!

179
00:09:54,174 --> 00:09:57,174
大丈夫か？公式でできんのか？
Is this okay? Can we show this officially?

180
00:09:57,174 --> 00:09:59,008
ホロライブ、心配でござる。
Hololive is worried about this.

181
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:03,016
ああ、これは… これは違うよね
Ah, this... this isn't right, is it?

182
00:10:08,516 --> 00:10:10,516
ずっと沙花叉と戯れてるじゃん
You're just playing with Sakamata all the time.

183
00:10:12,516 --> 00:10:14,516
やばいやばいやばい
Oh no, oh no, oh no!

184
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:28,016

That was good, so pretty.

185
00:10:28,516 --> 00:10:30,016
うん、本当によかったよね
Yeah, it was really good.

186
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:35,016
沙花叉のなんかギャップっていうのが、よかったよね
Sakamata's, like, gap was really good, wasn't it?

187
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:37,516
ライブパートはめっちゃよかった
The live part was awesome.

188
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:43,016
でもね、沙花叉さんと戯れてる姿もね、よかったでござる
But seeing you play with Sakamata-san was also good.

189
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:44,516
よかったよね！
It was good, wasn't it!

190
00:10:45,016 --> 00:10:47,016
水淀んでる感じがあれよね、すごくよかった
That murky water feeling was really good.

191
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:50,016
反復横跳びが… よかった
The side-to-side jumps were... good.

192
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:57,016
きもいきもい！ありえなーい！ありえなーい！
Gross, gross! No way! No way!

193
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:05,516

00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:23,016
健全す… 健全すぎよ
Whole... too wholesome.

198
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,016

めちゃくちゃよかったよね。めっちゃ感動したよ
That was amazing. I was really moved.

すごかった！
It was amazing!

202
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:02,016
ずっとずっと尻尾振ってたんだよね
My tail was wagging the whole time.

203
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,516
めちゃくちゃ可愛いんだ。イマジナリー尻尾が振ってるかのような
It's so cute. Like an imaginary tail was wagging.

204
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:13,516
初めてのオリジナル曲だからでも嬉しい、仲間に戻ってもらえて
It's my first original song, so I'm happy to have everyone back together.

見ましょう
Let's watch.

208
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:28,016
でももう記憶に新しいんじゃないかな
But it's probably still fresh in your memory, right?

209
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:29,516
最近だね
It was recent.

210
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:43,016
じたばたしないの！
Don't struggle!

211
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:46,516
じたばたする悪い子はお仕置きがあるよ
Bad kids who struggle will get a punishment.

212
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:50,516
お仕置きください！
Please punish me!

213
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:52,016
もみもみしないの
Don't squeeze!

214
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:03,016
イラストもめっちゃ嬉しかった
I was so happy about the illustration too.

215
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:10,016
やっぱりね、あの憧れのステージでみんなで立ちたいなっていう夢があって
After all, I had a dream of standing on that stage I've long admired with everyone.

216
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:14,516
ちょっとみんなを出したいなと思ってイラストをちょっとね
I wanted to include everyone, so I had that illustration made.

217
00:13:15,516 --> 00:13:17,516
やばいそれは
That's crazy.

218
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:28,516
やっぱり私もね、夢を見たいから、みんなで夢を見たいなっていうことで、ああいう演出にさせていただきました
After all, I want to dream too, so I wanted to dream with everyone, which is why I made that kind of production.

219
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:31,516
めちゃくちゃよかった
It was so good.

220
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:34,516
沙花叉のお手紙もよかったよ
Chloe's letter was good too.

221
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:38,016
やばいから！みんなが泣いちゃう
It's dangerous! Everyone will cry.

222
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:42,516
ぜひアーカイブで見てください
Please watch the archive.

223
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:46,516
そして何か先ほど最後って言ってたけどね
And although I said "the last" just now...

224
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:51,516
うちの総帥も素晴らしい3Dお披露目をしているので
Our Leader also had a wonderful 3D debut.

225
00:13:54,016 --> 00:13:56,016
見ようや
Let's watch it.

226
00:13:57,516 --> 00:13:59,516
ラプラスのVTRどうぞ
Here is La+ Darknesss' VTR.

227
00:14:03,516 --> 00:14:05,016
なんで？なんで笑うの？
Why? Why are you laughing?

228
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,516
京都！ラプラスとのデートじゃん
Kyoto! It's a date with Laplus.

229
00:14:15,516 --> 00:14:17,516
これ一番センシティブじゃない？
Isn't this the most sensitive part?

230
00:14:18,516 --> 00:14:20,516
何も見えてないから
You can't see anything.

231
00:14:36,516 --> 00:14:38,516
めちゃくちゃよかったよね
It was amazing.

232
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:43,516
やっぱりね、VLOG撮れたのがよかった
After all, I'm glad I could film the VLOG.

233
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,516
今までにない3Dお披露目だったよね
It was a 3D debut like never before.

234
00:14:49,016 --> 00:14:52,016
ずっと前からありたいって言ってたことができたから
I was able to do what I'd been saying I wanted to do for a long time.

235
00:14:56,016 --> 00:14:57,516
暇だったら見てよ
Watch it if you're free.

236
00:14:58,016 --> 00:14:59,516
見てください！
Please watch it!

237
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:01,024
ねぇ。
Hey.

238
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:03,024
広いアジト、うれしいね。
It's great having a spacious lair, isn't it?

239
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:03,824
ねぇ。
Yeah.

240
00:15:05,524 --> 00:15:06,524
何なの？
What is it?

241
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:08,024
照れちゃって、もう。
You're so shy.

242
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:10,024
五人の見ていただけに。
Just by seeing the five of us...

243
00:15:17,324 --> 00:15:20,524
皆さん、3Dお披露目おめでとう。
Everyone, congratulations on your 3D reveal.

244
00:15:20,624 --> 00:15:22,524
ありがとうございます！
Thank you very much!

245
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:29,524
ところで、holoXの目的、忘れてないですか？
By the way, have you forgotten holoX's goal?

246
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:31,524
え？
Eh?

247
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:36,024
世界征服だろーよ！
It's world conquest!

248
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:44,024
成長を見るために、世界征服、そして秘密結社に必要な能力をチェックします。
To see your growth, we'll check the skills needed for world conquest and a secret society.

249
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:57,524
秘密結社に必要な能力とは、何でしょうね？
What are the skills necessary for a secret society?

250
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:01,024
急にクイズ始まったんだけど！
A quiz suddenly started?!

251
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:11,024
今回は能力をチェックする企画を用意しています。
We have prepared a project to check your abilities this time.

252
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,524
何も答え出てないまま、勝手に進められるんだけど。
It's just moving forward without any answers.

253
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:19,524
幹部？
Exec?

254
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:21,024
お前、グルか？
Are you in on this?

255
00:16:21,124 --> 00:16:23,024
違う、違う、違う！
No, no, no!

256
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:27,524
メモ用紙を渡すので、いい感じにどうぞ。
I'll hand out some memo pads, so please do your best.

257
00:16:27,624 --> 00:16:29,024
適当だなー。
So vague.

258
00:16:29,124 --> 00:16:31,024
メモ用紙？
Memo pads?

259
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,524
おー、来た来た。
Oh, here they come.

260
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:37,524
雑だなー、雑！
So rough! So rough!

261
00:16:38,324 --> 00:16:41,524
はい、ちょっとめちゃくちゃ無茶振りされたんですけどね。
Yes, I was given quite an unreasonable request.

262
00:16:41,624 --> 00:16:43,524
メモ、ちょっと読んでいきましょう。
Let's read the memo.

263
00:16:43,624 --> 00:16:45,024
お願いします。
Please do.

264
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:49,024
えっーと、まず最初の能力は...
Um, first of all, the first skill is...

265
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:51,524
「洞察力」。
Insight.

266
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:54,024
洞察力！
Insight!

267
00:16:54,124 --> 00:16:56,524
洞察力って何ですか？
What is insight?

268
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:01,524
まあ、何か見極める能力みたいな感じかな？
Well, I guess it's something like the ability to discern things?

269
00:17:01,624 --> 00:17:02,524
オッケー。
Okay.

270
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:07,524
ということで、チャレンジする企画はこちら！
So, here is the project we'll be challenging!

271
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:13,024
「holoX Secret Container Boxの中身を、探れ！！」
holoX Secret Container - Guess what's inside the box!!

272
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:16,024
めっちゃ用意してる！
They've prepared so much!

273
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:27,524
どんどん、どんどん、何、何、何？
What, what, what's coming next?

274
00:17:27,624 --> 00:17:28,524
召喚される。
It's being summoned.

275
00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:30,024
何や、これ？
What's this?

276
00:17:30,124 --> 00:17:33,024
召喚の儀が行われてる。
A summoning ritual is taking place.

277
00:17:33,124 --> 00:17:37,024
でもこれさ、いつも使ってるやつじゃん。
But wait, this is what we always use.

278
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:40,024
これ我が家にあるやつ。
This is the one in my house.

279
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:41,524
みんなで使ってるやつだ。
It's the one we all use.

280
00:17:41,624 --> 00:17:43,024
ラプラスちっちゃ。
Laplus is so small.

281
00:17:43,124 --> 00:17:43,824
うるせーな。
Shut up!

282
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:45,524
いつもお菓子箱だね。
It's always a snack box.

283
00:17:45,624 --> 00:17:49,024
菓子とか言うな！かっこいいやつだから！
Don't call it a snack box! It's a cool one!

284
00:17:49,524 --> 00:17:54,024
たくさんお菓子を入れてる所なんですけれども、こちらを使って。
It's where we keep lots of snacks, but using this...

285
00:17:54,524 --> 00:18:00,024
私が見本を見せなきゃいけないみたいなので、何をするか分かんないんですけど。
It seems I have to show an example, though I don't know what I'll be doing.

286
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:06,024
箱の中身を当てる的な感じみたいですね。
It seems like it's about guessing what's inside the box.

287
00:18:06,124 --> 00:18:07,524
なるほどね。
I see.

288
00:18:07,624 --> 00:18:14,524
じゃあ、ふに落ちないけど、私が先にやってみましょう。
Well, I'm not entirely convinced, but let me go first.

289
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:16,524
見本見せてくれよ。
Show us an example.

290
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:18,024
目隠しをする？
Do I wear a blindfold?

291
00:18:18,124 --> 00:18:22,024
じゃあ、沙花叉が目隠ししたい！
Then, Sakamata wants to do the blindfolding!

292
00:18:22,124 --> 00:18:25,024
それちょっと大丈夫？
Is that really okay?

293
00:18:25,124 --> 00:18:26,524
変なこと考えてないでござる。
I'm not thinking about anything weird.

294
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:32,024
じゃあちょっとお願いします。
Then, please go ahead.

295
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,524
お、いいかな？
Oh, is this good?

296
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:36,524
やめろよ！
Stop it!

297
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:38,524
間違っちゃった？
Did I make a mistake?

298
00:18:38,624 --> 00:18:40,524
前が分かんないじゃない！
I can't tell which way is front!

299
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:46,524
あー、おー、オッケーオッケー。
Ah, oh, okay, okay.

300
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:50,524
お前どこ連れて行くんや。
Where are you taking me?

301
00:18:50,624 --> 00:18:52,024
こっちこっち。
This way, this way.

302
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:56,524
じゃあ、箱の中身、誰かやってもらってもいいかな？
Then, can someone put something in the box?

303
00:18:57,024 --> 00:19:02,024
代わりにやりますね！入れ込むものは、こちらです！
We'll do it for you! The item going in is this!

304
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:05,024
おー！
Oh!

305
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:08,524
確かに分かりやすい。
Certainly easy to tell.

306
00:19:08,624 --> 00:19:12,524
これはさすがに分かるんじゃないか？
Surely she can tell what this is?

307
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:16,024
大丈夫なやつかな？
Is it something safe?

308
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:18,524
お前大丈夫だ、怖くない！
You'll be fine, it's not scary!

309
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,524
ちょっと噛み付くかもしれない。
It might bite a little.

310
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:23,024
噛み付く噛み付く。
It bites, it bites.

311
00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:26,524
変なこと考えてないでござる。
Don't think of anything weird.

312
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,024
結構おとなしい方だと思うけどな。
I think it's pretty well-behaved.

313
00:19:29,524 --> 00:19:32,524
制限時間20秒で行きましょう！
Let's go with a 20-second time limit!

314
00:19:32,624 --> 00:19:34,524
せーの、ドン！
Ready, go!

315
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:39,024
音はしてないから大丈夫だ。いくわ。
It's not making any sound, so it's fine. Here I go.

316
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:41,524
噛み付くかもしれん。
It might bite.

317
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:45,024
おー、どうだ？頑張れ！
Oh, how is it? Do your best!

318
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:47,524
あ、これ何か分かるぞ。私よく使ってる。
Ah, I know what this is. I use it often.

319
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:50,524
えっーと、かき回しのやつ。
Um, the stirring thing.

320
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:53,024
料理に使う、かき回し器！
Used for cooking, a stirring tool!

321
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:56,524
終了！
Finished!

322
00:19:56,624 --> 00:19:59,024
それじゃあ、答えをお願いします！
Well then, please give us your answer!

323
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,332
あ！答えは...！
Oh! The answer is...!

324
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:05,332
泡だて器！泡だて器！
A whisk! A whisk!

325
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:07,432
あ、泡だて器！
Ah, a whisk!

326
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:10,032
正解です！泡だて器！
Correct! A whisk!

327
00:20:10,032 --> 00:20:14,032
もう、答え出てたから...！
The answer was already out there...!

328
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:18,032
茹でたから... かき混ぜるやつって言ってた。
I said 'the thing you stir with' because I boiled it.

329
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:21,032
よかった！
Thank goodness!

330
00:20:21,032 --> 00:20:24,032
今度はちょろ... ちょろいな...
This time it's easy... so easy...

331
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:27,532
意外になんとかなるでござるな。
It surprisingly works out somehow, doesn't it?

332
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:30,032
大丈夫だったね。
It was fine, wasn't it?

333
00:20:30,032 --> 00:20:33,032
いつもいる人だからね。
Because she's someone who's always here.

334
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:37,032
わんこ... 吾輩だったらわかんないかも...
A dog... If it was me, I might not have known...

335
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:40,032
泡だて器が出てこない...
The word 'whisk' wouldn't come to mind...

336
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:44,032
動いてなくなさそうだったから大丈夫かなと思って、ガッてやったら大丈夫だったね。
It didn't seem like it was moving, so I thought it would be fine, and when I went for it, it was okay.

337
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:47,532
20秒めちゃくちゃ短いから。短いね。
20 seconds is extremely short. - It is short.

338
00:20:47,532 --> 00:20:50,032
次ラプラスちゃんやってみる？
Want to try next, La+-chan?

339
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:53,032
ラプラスやってみましょうか。吾輩こういうの得意だからな。
Shall we have La+ try? - I'm good at this sort of thing.

340
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:57,032
本当に？じゃあ目隠し付けてあげるよ。
Really? Then I'll put the blindfold on you.

341
00:20:57,032 --> 00:20:59,032
ありがとうございます。
Thank you very much.

342
00:20:59,032 --> 00:21:03,032
はい、ラプラスちゃん目隠し付けましょうね〜
Okay, let's put the blindfold on La+-chan~

343
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:06,032
あーっ！
Ahhh!

344
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:08,532
どうしたどうした？
What happened, what happened?

345
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:11,032
ちょっと今耳に息が...！
Your breath was just in my ear...!

346
00:21:11,032 --> 00:21:13,532
何やってんだよ！
What are you doing!

347
00:21:13,532 --> 00:21:15,532
ナイス、こよりちゃん。
Nice one, Koyori-chan.

348
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:18,532
目隠しって言ったらね、誘導しないと。
When we say blindfold, we have to guide her.

349
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:21,032
ここだよ、ここだよ。
It's here, it's here.

350
00:21:21,032 --> 00:21:24,032
お、これは... 絵面すごい...
Oh, this... the visual is amazing...

351
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:27,532
入れるものは... こちらですよ！
The thing we're putting in... is this!

352
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:31,032
はい、ラプラスの入れ物に入ってるのはこちら！
Yes, what's in La+'s box is this!

353
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:34,032
これ！わかりますか？
This! Do you know what it is?

354
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:38,032
やばそう！やばい！
That looks bad! Crazy!

355
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:43,032
でもなんかラプラスにぴったり。まあね、確かに。
But somehow it's perfect for La+. - Well, true enough.

356
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:48,032
このまま持って帰っていいよって言いたい感じのね、プレゼントかな？
I feel like telling her she can take it home just like this, like a present?

357
00:21:48,032 --> 00:21:52,032
20秒で当ててもらいましょう！はい、スタート！
Let's have her guess it in 20 seconds! Okay, start!

358
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:54,032
余裕だよ、これは。
This is a breeze.

359
00:21:54,032 --> 00:21:57,032
どこ？お、え、何だこれは？
Where? Oh, eh, what is this?

360
00:21:57,032 --> 00:22:01,032
大丈夫？ちょっと... 結構小さいからね。
Are you okay? It's quite small.

361
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:04,032
あ！わかった！わかった！
Ah! I got it! I got it!

362
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,032
わかった？
You got it?

363
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:09,532
これ、え、言っていいの？いつも使ってるもんね。
This, can you say it? You use it all the time, right?

364
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:11,032
おしゃぶり！
A pacifier!

365
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:13,532
おおーっ！速っ！
Whoa! That was fast!

366
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,532
正解 おしゃぶり
Correct: Pacifier

367
00:22:15,532 --> 00:22:18,032
ちょろ！いつも使ってるもんね。
Easy! Since I use it all the time.

368
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:22,032
いつも使ってるもんねってちょっとヒントだったかもしれない。
Maybe 'you use it all the time' was a bit of a hint.

369
00:22:22,032 --> 00:22:25,032
いつも使ってるタイプのやつ？
Is it the type you always use?

370
00:22:25,032 --> 00:22:28,032
うわ、本当だ！
Whoa, it really is!

371
00:22:28,032 --> 00:22:30,032
なるほどね。
I see.

372
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:34,032
結構正解してるね。我々の能力あるんじゃん？
We're getting a lot of them right. Maybe we have talent?

373
00:22:34,032 --> 00:22:37,532
じゃあ次はこより行ってみる？
Then, shall we have Koyori go next?

374
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:40,032
はい、行きます！自信のほどは？
Yes, I'll go! How's your confidence?

375
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:45,032
でも今まで来てるからね、どんどんと。こよりも頭脳ですから、やっちゃいますよ！
Well, we've been on a roll. Koyori is a brain too, so I'll do it!

376
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:48,032
やっちゃえやっちゃえ！
Do it, do it!

377
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:51,032
じゃあ目隠しは風真が付けるでござる。
Then Kazama will put the blindfold on.

378
00:22:51,032 --> 00:22:54,032
お願いします！え、ちょっとエッチなんじゃないですか？
Please! Eh, isn't this a bit lewd?

379
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:57,032
どこで見ようとしてるんだよ。
Where are you trying to look from?

380
00:22:57,032 --> 00:23:01,032
え、ちょっと！何も見てないから！何も見てないから！
Wait! I'm not looking at anything! I'm not looking at anything!

381
00:23:01,032 --> 00:23:05,032
大丈夫、何もしませんから！
It's okay, I won't do anything!

382
00:23:05,032 --> 00:23:08,532
何もしてないでござるよ！
I'm not doing anything!

383
00:23:08,532 --> 00:23:12,532
じゃあこよりに触ってもらうのはこちら！
Then, what Koyori will touch is this!

384
00:23:12,532 --> 00:23:15,532
お、どこどこ？
Oh, where, where?

385
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:18,532
ああ、でもこれは当ててほしいかな。
Ah, but I'd like her to guess this one.

386
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:22,532
博士さすがに... ああ、これね！
As expected of the Doctor... Ah, this!

387
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:26,532
はい、はい、はい。ありがとうありがとう。
Yes, yes, yes. Thank you, thank you.

388
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:30,532
じゃあ制限時間20秒で行きましょう！
Then, let's go with a 20-second time limit!

389
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:33,532
こよりのチャレンジ、スタート！
Koyori's challenge, start!

390
00:23:33,532 --> 00:23:41,532
触らないで一回推理で言うけど、マヨネーズだと思う。
I'll say it based on reasoning without touching first, but I think it's mayonnaise.

391
00:23:41,532 --> 00:23:44,032
ええーっ！？そんなまさか！
Eeeh!? No way!

392
00:23:44,032 --> 00:23:49,032
へ？違う？ケチャップ？崖の... マヨネーズじゃないの？
Eh? No? Ketchup? A cliff... it's not mayonnaise?

393
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:53,032
博士さすが！
As expected of the Doctor!

394
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:58,032
なんでみんなの言葉でわかっちゃうんだよ！
How can you tell just from everyone's words!

395
00:23:58,032 --> 00:24:02,032
博士マジ？しかしケチャップの可能性もある。
Doctor, seriously? But there's also the possibility of ketchup.

396
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:04,532
しかしね、そうでござるな。
However, that's true.

397
00:24:04,532 --> 00:24:07,532
が、マヨネーズ！
But, mayonnaise!

398
00:24:07,532 --> 00:24:10,532
はい、正解です！
Yes, that's correct!

399
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,532
正解 マヨネーズ
Correct: Mayonnaise

400
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:18,532
さすが！なんで推理したくなっちゃうんだろう... 頭脳だから。
As expected! I wonder why I want to deduce... because I'm a brain.

401
00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:22,532
やはり頭脳ということでござるな。やってるね。
It means you're indeed a brain. You're on it.

402
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:25,532
じゃあ次はいろは行ってみようか。
Then, let's have Iroha go next.

403
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:28,532
はい！じゃあ吾輩が付けてあげるよ。
Yes! Then I'll put it on you.

404
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:31,532
本当に？届くでござるか？なめてんぬ？
Really? Can you reach? Are you underestimating me?

405
00:24:31,532 --> 00:24:35,532
やぁーっ！
Yaaah!

406
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:40,532
やりたい放題じゃん！わかったよ、はい、しゃがんでください。
You're just doing whatever you want! I get it, okay, please crouch down.

407
00:24:40,532 --> 00:24:44,532
ああーっ！
Ahhh!

408
00:24:44,532 --> 00:24:47,532
はい、目隠ししました！
Okay, blindfold is on!

409
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:49,532
なんでわかるの？
How can you tell?

410
00:24:49,532 --> 00:24:53,532
なんか感覚... みんなのいる感覚がすごいな...
Somehow the feeling... the feeling of everyone being there is amazing...

411
00:24:53,532 --> 00:24:57,532
ではいろはに当ててもらうものはこちら！
Then, the thing for Iroha to guess is this!

412
00:24:57,532 --> 00:25:00,032
なんだろう？なに？
What is it? What?

413
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Boxの中身を探れ!!
Identify the contents of the box!!

414
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,840
ちょっと待って
Wait a second

415
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,140
これちょっとヤバい
This is a bit crazy

416
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,140
これヤバい
This is crazy

417
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,540
何だろう、何だろう
What is it, what is it?

418
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,040
え、何これ、ヤバい
Eh, what's this? Crazy

419
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,540
ねえ、間違えて引いちゃうとヤバいかも
Hey, it might be bad if you pull it by mistake

420
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,540
離れて、離れて！離れて！
Stay back, stay back! Stay back!

421
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,040
怖いでござるが、行きます
It's scary, but I'm going in

422
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,240
制限時間は20秒です
The time limit is 20 seconds

423
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,040
いろはのチャレンジ、スタート！
Iroha's challenge, start!

424
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,540
頑張れ！
Good luck!

425
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,540
怖いでござる…
I'm scared...

426
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,040
あ、やめて、やめて！やめて！
Ah, stop it, stop it! Stop it!

427
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,040
いろは、それ引いてもいいんじゃない？
Iroha, shouldn't you just pull that?

428
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
そう、それ引いてもいいんだよ
Yeah, it's okay to pull that

429
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,540
いくら…いくらなんでも…
No matter... no matter what...

430
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
引かせに行こうとしてるやん！
You're trying to make me pull it!

431
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,040
待って、分かったかも！分かったかも！
Wait, I might know! I might know!

432
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,540
引いていいの？
Is it okay to pull?

433
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,040
クラッカーでござるか？

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,040
でかいもんね
It's big, after all

438
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,040
あんなに引いていいって言われて引かないの凄いから
It's amazing how you didn't pull it despite being told so much

439
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,540
なんか、後処理のことを考えちゃった
I was just thinking about the cleanup

440
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,540
凄いでたんだけど！見えないって！
So much came out! I can't see!

441
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,040
やりたくなっちゃった
I just really wanted to do it

442
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,040
とんでもなくびっくりした
That incredibly surprised me

443
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,540
クロヱ行ってみようか最後に
Chloe, why don't you go last?

444
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,540
ここまで当たってるからね
We've been right every time so far

445
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,540
怖いよ、なんかいんの？
I'm scared, is there something in there?

446
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,540
私がつけてあげるから
I'll put it on for you

447
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,040
もういいってば！ご機嫌でござるよ！
I said enough already! I'm in a good mood!

448
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,040
誰？何、どこ？
Who is it? What, where?

449
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,040
何にビビってんだよ。大丈夫だって
What are you so scared of? It's fine

450
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:22,040
クロヱに触ってもらうのはこちら！
What Chloe will be touching is this!

451
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,040
え、何？ヤバい！
Eh, what? This is bad!

452
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,040
怖くて離れちゃった、離れちゃった
I got scared and moved away, I moved away

453
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,040
大丈夫、慣れてる、大丈夫
It's okay, you're used to it, it's fine

454
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,040
早く触れよ！
Touch it already!

455
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,040
まだ動いてないから。大丈夫、大丈夫
It's not moving yet. It's okay, it's okay

456
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,040

How does it feel?

461
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,540
ヌボヌボしてる、中が…
It's slimy... inside...

462
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,540
どんな、え、どんな触感？
What, eh, what texture is it?

463
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,540
生物じゃない？
Isn't it a living thing?

464
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,040
はい、ではクロヱさん、答えをどうぞ
Okay, now Chloe-san, please give your answer

465
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,040
手の匂い嗅ぐな！

00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,540

ガチで臭いよ
It really stinks

473
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,040
外そう、外そう
Let's take it off, let's take it off

474
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,040
何これ、大きい！
What is this? It's huge!

475
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:08,040
クロヱには1時間、生臭いままでいてもらいます
We'll have Chloe stay smelling like fish for an hour

476
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,540
本当に臭い！
It really stinks!

477
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,040

Next up is Undercover Investigation!

484
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,040
潜入捜査！
Undercover Investigation!

485
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,040
任せんでござる！
Leave it to me!

486
00:30:01,348 --> 00:30:04,114
じゃあチャレンジする企画発表します。
Then, I'll announce the challenge project.

487
00:30:04,248 --> 00:30:04,981
発表します！
Announce it!

488
00:30:05,148 --> 00:30:09,214
すり抜けろ！ holoX Secret Silhouette!
Slip through! holoX Secret Silhouette!

489
00:30:09,548 --> 00:30:11,814
イエーイ！
Yay!

490
00:30:12,748 --> 00:30:14,081
どういうこと？
What do you mean?

491
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:16,148
え、どういうことなんだろうね。
Uh, I wonder what it means.

492
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:17,381
何やるの？
What are we doing?

493
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:20,681
こちらの企画は、すごい広い場所を
For this project, it seems like a very large

494
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:24,014
用意しているらしいので、まずはそこに移動するらしいですね。
place has been prepared, so we'll move there first.

495
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,314
えっ！？マジで！？
Eh!? Seriously!?

496
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:28,214
じゃあ移動していきましょう。ジャンプしたら移動できる。
Then let's move. We can move if we jump.

497
00:30:28,448 --> 00:30:28,981
オッケー。
Okay.

498
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:30,981
行くぞ、せーの！
Let's go, one, two...!

499
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:33,248
イエーイ！
Yay!

500
00:30:35,448 --> 00:30:36,614
うわぁ！
Whoa!

501
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:37,914
バラバラすぎんだろ！
We're too scattered!

502
00:30:38,214 --> 00:30:39,681
ジャンプ下手すぎんだろ！
You guys are too bad at jumping!

503
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:43,814
ということでこの企画はですね、あるシルエットを
So, for this project, objects shaped like

504
00:30:43,814 --> 00:30:46,781
かたどった物体が迫ってくるので、そのシルエットに
certain silhouettes will approach, and you're

505
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:49,514
合わせてくぐり抜けをしてほしいということだそうです。
asked to pass through them according to that silhouette.

506
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,614
あー、そういうことか。
Ah, I see.

507
00:30:53,448 --> 00:30:56,148
潜入捜査じゃん！
It's like an undercover investigation!

508
00:30:56,548 --> 00:30:58,781
我が輩余裕だって！
I can do this easily!

509
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,214
余裕ですか？
Easily?

510
00:31:00,548 --> 00:31:01,414
余裕だよね。
Easily, right?

511
00:31:01,848 --> 00:31:05,014
じゃあ、実際に見本を見せてもらおうかなと
Then, I'd like to see a demonstration.

512
00:31:05,014 --> 00:31:08,148
思うんですけど。まあこういうのに
Well, there's only one person who's

513
00:31:08,148 --> 00:31:10,881
長けてる人、一人しかいないんだよな。
good at this kind of thing.

514
00:31:11,748 --> 00:31:12,814
我が輩かな？
Me?

515
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:14,281
お前じゃない。
Not you.

516
00:31:17,348 --> 00:31:19,514
ということでいろは、やってみてもらってもいいかな？
So Iroha, could you try it?

517
00:31:20,048 --> 00:31:21,081
え、いろは？
Eh, Iroha?

518
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:24,081
用心棒だからね。毒味みたいな感じで。
Because you're the bodyguard. Like a food taster.

519
00:31:24,448 --> 00:31:26,214
確かに！殺る気満々！
True! Full of killing intent!

520
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:28,514
一番最初に。じゃあ侍、頑張ってね。
The very first one. Then, Samurai, good luck.

521
00:31:28,948 --> 00:31:30,114
頑張って！頑張って！
Good luck! Good luck!

522
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:31,781
もしかしたら死ぬかもしれないけど。
I might die, though.

523
00:31:31,948 --> 00:31:32,914
見捨てないで！
Don't abandon us!

524
00:31:33,248 --> 00:31:35,848
今までありがとう！
Thank you for everything!

525
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:37,448
ねえ！ちょっと！
Hey! Wait!

526
00:31:38,748 --> 00:31:41,614
まあでも風真、身を挺して皆のこと守らないといけないからね。
Well, Kazama, you have to protect everyone by putting yourself on the line.

527
00:31:41,848 --> 00:31:43,214
かっこいい！
So cool!

528
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:46,014
じゃあ見本。っていうのがやってくるのかな？
So, a demo. Is it coming?

529
00:31:46,348 --> 00:31:47,581
やってくるらしいので。
It seems it's coming.

530
00:31:47,848 --> 00:31:49,514
やってくるってどう来るんだろう？
How will it come?

531
00:31:49,748 --> 00:31:51,314
スタートって言えば来るのかな？
Will it come if I say "Start"?

532
00:31:51,548 --> 00:31:52,614
じゃあ行きましょう。
Then let's go.

533
00:31:53,348 --> 00:31:56,614
風真いろはの挑戦です、スタート！
Kazama Iroha's challenge, start!

534
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:58,314
おおー！来た来た！
Oh! It's here!

535
00:31:58,548 --> 00:31:59,614
えっ、何何？
Eh, what what?

536
00:31:59,848 --> 00:32:00,381
あ、来た！
Ah, it's here!

537
00:32:00,648 --> 00:32:01,881
待って、あそこにあれが。
Wait, that thing over there.

538
00:32:02,148 --> 00:32:04,314
簡単そう。全然大丈夫だね。
Looks easy. I'll be fine.

539
00:32:05,148 --> 00:32:06,214
超簡単じゃない？
Isn't it super easy?

540
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:08,448
待って待って。え、爆笑じゃん。
Wait, wait. Eh, this is hilarious.

541
00:32:08,748 --> 00:32:10,014
わ、来てる来てる！
Whoa, it's coming, it's coming!

542
00:32:10,148 --> 00:32:12,681
動いてはならぬ。動いてはならぬ。
Must not move. Must not move.

543
00:32:12,748 --> 00:32:14,314
おおー！
Ohhh!

544
00:32:14,948 --> 00:32:16,514
え、なんか簡単じゃない？
Eh, isn't it kind of easy?

545
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:18,281
爆笑じゃねえか。余裕じゃねえか。
It's hilarious. It's a piece of cake.

546
00:32:18,548 --> 00:32:19,214
やった！
I did it!

547
00:32:19,448 --> 00:32:22,114
これ別に我が輩でもできたじゃん。
I could've done this too.

548
00:32:22,648 --> 00:32:24,781
え、でもなんか角が邪魔そうじゃない？
Eh, but don't the horns look like they'd get in the way?

549
00:32:25,148 --> 00:32:27,214
うるさい、うるさい！退け退け！
Shut up, shut up! Get out of the way!

550
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:30,581
合格でいいんだけど、じゃあこれは、
That was a pass, so next,

551
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:33,781
続いてはこより、ルイ、クロヱ、いろは、ラプの順で行こうか。
let's go in the order of Koyori, Lui, Chloe, Iroha, La+.

552
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:38,914
我が輩がトリってことだな。
So I'm the closer.

553
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:40,981
見本いっぱい見といてよ。
Watch the demos carefully.

554
00:32:41,348 --> 00:32:42,581
任して任して。
Leave it to us.

555
00:32:43,348 --> 00:32:47,414
さっき堂々としてたからね。じゃあ、こよりが行きます！
You were so confident earlier. Then, Koyori's going!

556
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:50,981
頑張れ、頑張れ！
Good luck, good luck!

557
00:32:51,348 --> 00:32:54,681
えー、どんなのが来るんだろう。
Eh, I wonder what's coming.

558
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,881
でもさっきの見たらさ、簡単そうだよね。
But looking at the one before, it seems easy.

559
00:32:57,148 --> 00:32:57,914
簡単そうだったね。
It did look easy.

560
00:32:58,248 --> 00:33:00,381
こよりはサバンナを生き抜いてきたこよりですからね。
Koyori is a Koyori who has survived the savannah.

561
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:03,081
確かに。フラミンゴめっちゃサバンナっぽいね。
True. Flamingos are very savannah-like.

562
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,514
めっちゃフラフラじゃない？
Aren't you swaying a lot?

563
00:33:05,748 --> 00:33:06,448
砂漠だもんな。
It's a desert, after all.

564
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:09,681
こんなに乾いてないよサバンナ。やめろ！
The savannah isn't this dry. Stop it!

565
00:33:10,548 --> 00:33:12,814
ホーク（フォーク）で遊ぶな！
Don't play with the hawk/fork!

566
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:14,981
来い！スタートかな？
Come! Start?

567
00:33:15,848 --> 00:33:16,681
おおー！来た来た！
Oh! It's here!

568
00:33:16,848 --> 00:33:17,914
えっ、待って！
Eh, wait!

569
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:19,214
すごい、逆さま。
Amazing, it's upside down.

570
00:33:19,448 --> 00:33:22,614
待って、待って、待って！え、急におかしいだろ！
Wait, wait, wait! Eh, this is suddenly weird!

571
00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:24,214
行け行け、行ける行ける！
Go, go, you can do it!

572
00:33:24,448 --> 00:33:25,781
こよ、頑張れ！
Koyo, hang in there!

573
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:31,981
うわぁぁぁ！
Uwaaaah!

574
00:33:32,448 --> 00:33:34,081
こよりちゃん飛んでった！
Koyori-chan flew away!

575
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:35,081
死んじゃった。
She died.

576
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:36,681
いい奴だったな。
She was a good person.

577
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,814
今までありがとう！
Thank you for everything!

578
00:33:39,148 --> 00:33:40,448
本当にお疲れ様でした。
Good job out there.

579
00:33:41,348 --> 00:33:43,981
こよりちゃーん！
Koyori-chaaan!

580
00:33:45,348 --> 00:33:48,081
やられたな。尸を越えていけ。
She got taken out. Go over her corpse.

581
00:33:51,548 --> 00:33:54,214
こより任せろ。この私がやってやるよ。
Koyori, leave it to me. I'll do it.

582
00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:56,614
おおー！ルイ姉！
Oh! Lui-nee!

583
00:33:56,848 --> 00:34:00,381
お任せください。一番の長身でちょっと心配なんですけど。
Leave it to me. I'm the tallest so I'm a bit worried.

584
00:34:00,648 --> 00:34:02,881
一番背が高いからできなさそう。
Since you're the tallest, it might be impossible.

585
00:34:03,248 --> 00:34:04,248
危なそうだなぁ。
Seems dangerous.

586
00:34:04,548 --> 00:34:06,814
じゃあ私のはどんなシルエットなんだろう。
Then, I wonder what my silhouette will be.

587
00:34:07,448 --> 00:34:10,014
さっきのから考えると、あれなのか？
Considering the previous one, is it that?

588
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,014
おお！やっぱり！
Oh! Just as I thought!

589
00:34:12,148 --> 00:34:13,314
ジャンプしないといけないじゃん！
You have to jump!

590
00:34:13,548 --> 00:34:15,214
頑張れ、ルイ姉！
Good luck, Lui-nee!

591
00:34:15,548 --> 00:34:16,981
奇跡的に行けるかも。
You might miracle it.

592
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:18,681
行けー！
Go-!

593
00:34:21,048 --> 00:34:23,981
ルイ姉ー！可哀想ー！
Lui-nee! How pitiful!

594
00:34:26,048 --> 00:34:30,214
おい！ふざけすぎだろ！絶対やってるぞ！
Hey! This is too much! They're definitely doing it on purpose!

595
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:36,614
ひどかったな今。
That was terrible.

596
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:41,614
こんなのってないだろ！命がもったいない！
This is ridiculous! What a waste of life!

597
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:46,014
おかしいんだよ、さっきのいろはと全然違うだろ！
It's weird, it's totally different from Iroha's earlier!

598
00:34:46,348 --> 00:34:50,114
やめましょうよ。次のクロヱにアドバイスをすると、
Let's stop. Advice for Chloe next:

599
00:34:50,114 --> 00:34:52,781
ちょっと早めに飛んどくといいかも。
it might be better to jump a little early.

600
00:34:53,348 --> 00:34:55,314
オッケー、ちょっと早めに。
Okay, a little early.

601
00:34:55,748 --> 00:34:57,981
ジャンプさえすれば行ける可能性がある。
If you just jump, there's a chance.

602
00:34:58,248 --> 00:34:59,981
任せて。
Leave it to me.

603
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,356
これで切り抜けるから
I'll get through with this.

604
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:03,556
でもここまで来ると、なんか予想できてくるものがあるんだけど
But at this point, I feel like I can start to predict what's coming.

605
00:35:03,556 --> 00:35:06,356
風真、ちょっと嫌な予感しかしない、ちゃんと…
Kazama, I've got a bad feeling about this, just...

606
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:09,656
それでは、沙花叉の挑戦です！どうぞ！
Now, it's Sakamata's challenge! Go ahead!

607
00:35:09,656 --> 00:35:11,256
予想してる！
I'm predicting it!

608
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:13,556
え！？無理無理無理無理！
What!? Impossible, impossible, impossible!

609
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:16,856
行け行け行け行け！
Go go go go!

610
00:35:16,856 --> 00:35:18,856
行ける！行ける！
You can do it! You can do it!

611
00:35:23,056 --> 00:35:26,056
おかしいだろ！
That's just wrong!

612
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:28,056
飛んでいっちゃった…
She flew away...

613
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:30,256
絶対おかしい。
That's definitely weird.

614
00:35:30,256 --> 00:35:33,056
いい奴だった…あぁ、お空の彼方に帰ったか。
She was a good person... Ah, she went to the far side of the sky.

615
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:34,056
大丈夫か？
Are you okay?

616
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:36,156
誰か助けて！
Someone help me!

617
00:35:36,156 --> 00:35:38,256
さぁ、次は誰かな？
Now, who's next?

618
00:35:38,256 --> 00:35:43,056
いい感じだね。
That looks good.

619
00:35:43,056 --> 00:35:47,056
じゃあ次は…いろは、もう一回やってもらってもいい？
Then next... Iroha, could you do it one more time?

620
00:35:47,056 --> 00:35:50,056
あれだけじゃね、終わんないよ。
It won't end with just that.

621
00:35:50,056 --> 00:35:54,056
そうだよ！あれだけじゃ終わらないよ。
That's right! It doesn't end there.

622
00:35:54,056 --> 00:35:57,056
あんな簡単なやつでイキってんじゃねえぞ。
Don't act all high and mighty just because of that easy one.

623
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,056
そんなこと言う。
Don't say that.

624
00:36:00,056 --> 00:36:02,556
何が来るかな。いろはの挑戦はこちら！
I wonder what's coming. Iroha's challenge is this!

625
00:36:02,556 --> 00:36:04,056
はっ！
Ha!

626
00:36:04,056 --> 00:36:06,056
あ、いけそういけそう！
Oh, looks doable!

627
00:36:06,056 --> 00:36:08,056
いけるぞいけるぞ。
You can do it, you can do it.

628
00:36:08,056 --> 00:36:10,256
腕立てでいける？
Can you do it with a push-up?

629
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:12,056
ちょっと早めに！ちょっと早めに！
A bit earlier! A bit earlier!

630
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:21,056
いろはちゃーん！
Iroha-chaaan!

631
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:24,056
だめだったか…
It was no good...

632
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:28,056
幼児体型なのに。
Even with that child-like build.

633
00:36:28,056 --> 00:36:31,056
いいね、いいね。助けるから。
Nice, nice. We'll help you.

634
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:34,556
いや、このままじゃ終われないので。じゃあ総帥、最後お願いします！
Well, we can't end it like this. So leader, please take the last turn!

635
00:36:34,556 --> 00:36:37,556
任せとけ！もう。
Leave it to me! Jeez.

636
00:36:37,556 --> 00:36:40,056
取れそう？
Think you can get it?

637
00:36:40,056 --> 00:36:42,556
何言ってんだ！この辺がね、この辺が…
What are you talking about! This part, you see, this part...

638
00:36:42,556 --> 00:36:44,256
やりづらくない？
Doesn't it make it hard?

639
00:36:44,256 --> 00:36:47,056
うるせぇ！前座は黙ってろ！
Shut up! Openers should stay quiet!

640
00:36:47,056 --> 00:36:51,056
自分でも分かってる？この幅。
Do you even realize yourself? This width.

641
00:36:51,056 --> 00:36:53,056
うるせぇ！しかして！
Shut up! However!

642
00:36:53,056 --> 00:36:58,056
吾輩が、もうみんなの悔しい気持ちとか、もう辛い気持ち全部受け止めるから！
I will take all your frustrating feelings and painful feelings upon myself!

643
00:36:58,056 --> 00:37:01,056
長い、長い。ラプラスに挑戦してもらうのは、こちら！
Too long, too long. The challenge for La+ is this!

644
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:04,556
え！？
What!?

645
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,056
ふざけんな！
Are you kidding me!?

646
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:10,056
ちょっとしゃがめば。ちょっとしゃがめば。
If you just crouch a bit. If you just crouch a bit.

647
00:37:10,056 --> 00:37:13,556
超簡単、超簡単。
Super easy, super easy.

648
00:37:18,056 --> 00:37:22,056
おかしいだろ！なんでだよ！
That's wrong! Why!?

649
00:37:22,056 --> 00:37:26,056
今の絶対いけたでしょ！
You definitely could have done that just now!

650
00:37:26,056 --> 00:37:30,056
ひどい！やめてください！
Cruel! Please stop!

651
00:37:30,056 --> 00:37:34,056
やめてください。うちの子に…
Please stop. Not to our kid...

652
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:38,056
大丈夫？大丈夫？ラプラス。
Are you okay? Are you okay, La+?

653
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:42,056
いじめられたよ…
I was bullied...

654
00:37:42,056 --> 00:37:46,256
いじめられたね。こいつらもできてなかったのに。
You were bullied. Even though these guys couldn't do it either.

655
00:37:46,256 --> 00:37:50,056
そうだ、そうだ！吾輩だけ責められるのはおかしいじゃねえか、馬鹿が！
That's right! Isn't it weird that only I'm getting blamed, you idiots!

656
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:54,056
いや、これはでも、用意した人がちょっとずるくない？
Well, but isn't the person who prepared this being a bit unfair?

657
00:37:54,056 --> 00:37:57,056
そうだよ、そう。絶対無理だ。
Yeah, exactly. It's impossible.

658
00:37:57,056 --> 00:38:00,056
悪いことしてなくね？
We didn't do anything wrong, right?

659
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:04,056
なんとかしてクリアしようよ。じゃあ次は、ラプラスと私でやってみるみたいな感じなので。
Let's find a way to clear it. So next, it feels like La+ and I should give it a try.

660
00:38:04,056 --> 00:38:08,056
二人でやってみましょう。
Let's try as a pair.

661
00:38:08,056 --> 00:38:12,056
吾輩たち、伊達に長く一緒にいないから。
We haven't been together all this time for nothing.

662
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,056
やめて、やめて。この中で一番難しそうな二人なんだけど。
Stop, stop. You two look like the hardest combination.

663
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:18,056
確かに、一番難易度高そうだ。それでは二人が挑戦するのは、こちら！
True, the difficulty seems highest. Well then, the challenge for these two is this!

664
00:38:18,056 --> 00:38:21,056
なんだ？
What is it?

665
00:38:21,056 --> 00:38:24,056
ええ！？
Whaaa!?

666
00:38:24,056 --> 00:38:27,056
何これ！？いけるいける！
What's this!? You can do it!

667
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:30,056
手、手！無理だよ！
The hands, the hands! No way!

668
00:38:30,056 --> 00:38:34,056
頑張れ！早めに！
Go for it! Do it early!

669
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:44,056
おかしいだろ！なんでホラミ行けないんだよ！
That's wrong! Why couldn't we go!?

670
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:47,056
なに怖いここ！もうやめます！世界征服やめます！
This place is scary! I'm quitting! I'm quitting world domination!

671
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:51,056
酷すぎる。うちの偉い人が飛んでっちゃった。
This is too much. Our high leader flew away.

672
00:38:51,056 --> 00:38:55,056
可哀想だよ。もうこれ、俺ら悪くないよね？
Poor thing. This isn't our fault, right?

673
00:38:55,056 --> 00:38:59,056
ホロックス悪くないよね？
holoX isn't to blame, right?

674
00:38:59,056 --> 00:39:02,056
じゃあなんか最後に、ホロックスの力見せとく？全員でってこと？
Then, as a finale, should we show off holoX's power? You mean all together?

675
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:05,056
まあ余裕ですよ。
Well, it'll be easy.

676
00:39:05,056 --> 00:39:09,056
いや無理だよ。諦めてんの？
No, it's impossible. Are you giving up?

677
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:12,056
いけるいける、抜けれるよ。
We can do it, we can get through.

678
00:39:12,056 --> 00:39:16,056
よし、我々ならできるはずだよ。
Alright, we should be able to do it.

679
00:39:16,056 --> 00:39:20,056
ちょっと予行練習しよう。何が来てもいいように。吾輩、こんなんでもいける。
Let's do a little rehearsal. So we're ready for whatever comes. I can even do this.

680
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:23,056
私はじゃあ、これかな。
Then I'll do... this maybe.

681
00:39:23,056 --> 00:39:27,056
これにこう被せる。じゃあ、五人にやってもらうのは、こちら！
I'll cover it like this. Now, for the five of you, here's your challenge!

682
00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:29,056
えっ！？
What!?

683
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:32,056
ダメだ！吾輩ここだ！入りきらない！
No good! I'm over here! I won't fit!

684
00:39:32,056 --> 00:39:35,056
待って、風真ないかも、これ。
Wait, Kazama might not be there.

685
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:38,056
Oだ、O。ワンチャンある？
It's O, O. Is there a chance?

686
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:41,056
どう、どう？
How is it, how is it?

687
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:45,056
行け！
Go!

688
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:53,056
バイバイ。みんなバイバイ。
Bye-bye. Bye-bye everyone.

689
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:57,056
絶対おかしいよね。ホラミ、また遊び出したの？
This is definitely wrong. Did Holomi start playing around again?

690
00:39:57,056 --> 00:40:00,056
何を考えておるでござるか！
What on earth were you thinking!?

691
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,364
やったー！
Hooray!

692
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:02,364
吾輩だけクリア！
I'm the only one who cleared it!

693
00:40:02,464 --> 00:40:03,464
吾輩だけクリア！
I'm the only one who cleared it!

694
00:40:03,497 --> 00:40:04,530
吾輩だけクリア！
I'm the only one who cleared it!

695
00:40:04,664 --> 00:40:08,564
えー、じゃあ、なんか、そうだね、ラプラス置いて、アジトに戻ろうか。
Well then, how about we leave Laplus behind and head back to the hideout?

696
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,364
あ、そうだね。
Ah, that sounds like a good idea.

697
00:40:09,364 --> 00:40:10,597
なんで！？待って！
Wait, why?!

698
00:40:10,597 --> 00:40:11,864
じゃあね！じゃあね！バイバイ！
See ya! See ya! Bye-bye!

699
00:40:11,964 --> 00:40:13,164
待ってー！行かないで！
Wait! Don't go!

700
00:40:13,164 --> 00:40:15,597
バイバーイ！お疲れ！お疲れ！
Bye-bye! Good work! Good work!

701
00:40:15,764 --> 00:40:17,364
やだー！行かないでー！
Nooo! Don't go!

702
00:41:18,464 --> 00:41:21,330
あー、ただいまー。疲れたー。
Ah, we're back. So tired.

703
00:41:21,864 --> 00:41:24,297
もう夢落ちだったってこと？
So it was all just a dream?

704
00:41:24,464 --> 00:41:27,997
皆、先に帰っちゃうから、走ってきたんだぞ、吾輩！
You all left without me, so I had to run back!

705
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:32,497
えらい、えらい、えらい。頑張った、頑張った。おめでとう。頑張った。
Good girl, good girl. You did your best. Congrats, you worked hard.

706
00:41:32,764 --> 00:41:37,397
で、どうだった？この企画。洞察力と潜入捜査。
So, how was this project? Insight and undercover investigation.

707
00:41:37,397 --> 00:41:41,930
何が潜入なんだよ！誰も潜入してないでござる！
What do you mean undercover?! Nobody was undercover!

708
00:41:42,564 --> 00:41:45,397
潜入捜査、かなりきつかったよね。
The undercover investigation was pretty tough, wasn't it?

709
00:41:45,497 --> 00:41:48,397
そうだね、きつかったよ。なんか、いじめられてないですか？これ。
Yeah, it was. Wait, aren't we just being bullied here?

710
00:41:48,564 --> 00:41:52,497
確かに、おかしいでござる。何が潜入捜査だ！
True, it is weird. undercover investigation, my foot!

711
00:41:52,664 --> 00:41:57,164
もう、毎回これやるなよ、もう。何？これ、うるさいだけだ！
Geez, don't do this every time. What is this? It's just noisy!

712
00:41:57,397 --> 00:42:01,364
皆さん、いかがでしたか？
How was it, everyone?

713
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:07,530
さて次が最後になります。
Now, it's time for the final part.

714
00:42:07,564 --> 00:42:11,297
秘密結社に一番必要な能力、わかりますよね？
You know the most essential skill for a secret society, right?

715
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:14,430
金！力！権力！
Money! Power! Authority!

716
00:42:14,464 --> 00:42:15,730
力こそパワー！
Might is power!

717
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:20,597
何？筋肉？分かった。
What? Muscles? I get it.

718
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:27,930
筋肉じゃないだろ。多分、あの、5人で力を合わせて頑張るっていうことで、団結力。
It's not muscles. It's probably about the five of us working together, unity.

719
00:42:27,997 --> 00:42:30,464
団結力
Unity

720
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,797
おー！言っちゃったよ、言っちゃった。
Oh! You said it, you said it.

721
00:42:33,864 --> 00:42:41,430
そうだね。てか、さっき団結力ないこと分かったし。もう、やってったって大丈夫でござる。メモにデカデカと書いちゃった。
Right. I mean, we already saw we have no unity. We'll be fine. I already wrote it down in huge letters in my notes.

722
00:42:42,564 --> 00:42:49,264
団結力か。でも、長いこと一緒にいるから普通にあるんじゃね？
Unity, huh? But we've been together for a long time, so we should have some, right?

723
00:42:49,397 --> 00:42:51,364
余裕じゃない？
Should be a breeze, right?

724
00:42:51,364 --> 00:42:53,397
てか、何やらされるの？
Wait, what are they going to make us do?

725
00:42:51,397 --> 00:42:56,697
というわけで最後にチャレンジしてもらうのは...
And so, the final challenge for you is...

726
00:42:56,864 --> 00:42:58,797
なんと...
It's...

727
00:42:58,797 --> 00:43:01,364
溜めるなよ！溜めるな！
Don't build up the suspense! Don't build it up!

728
00:43:01,397 --> 00:43:04,364
大縄跳びです。
Long rope jumping.

729
00:43:04,397 --> 00:43:09,364
大縄！？何？運動会？おふざけんな、体育館じゃねえんだよ、ここは！
Long rope?! What? Is this a sports day? Stop messing around, this isn't a gym!

730
00:43:09,564 --> 00:43:12,664
あの、帰ります。失礼します。苦手でしょう、これ、無理だよ。
Um, I'm going home. Excuse me. We're bad at this, it's impossible.

731
00:43:12,797 --> 00:43:16,230
やだ！もうやだ、本当。帰るなら誘えよ！
No! I'm done, seriously. If you're going home, take me with you!

732
00:43:16,264 --> 00:43:22,464
ではチャレンジお願いします。やだやだやだ！
Now, please start the challenge. No, no, no!

733
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:26,630
じゃあ、10回飛んでください。厳しいですか？
Well then, please jump 10 times. Is that too hard?

734
00:43:26,764 --> 00:43:31,464
でも、あの、いろはに一人で10回飛ばせれば...。団結力のほうに行っちゃうんだよ、団結力のほう。
But, if we just let Iroha jump 10 times by herself... wait, that's not unity at all.

735
00:43:31,564 --> 00:43:36,230
でも、これは団結力でござるから、皆で飛ばないといかんでござる。
But since this is about unity, we all have to jump together.

736
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,364
えー、めんどくさーい。
Ugh, what a pain.

737
00:43:38,497 --> 00:43:41,430
あ、なんかここに縄が！
Ah, look, there's a rope here!

738
00:43:41,464 --> 00:43:45,430
縄、縄の罠が。ホロゾーからの縄の罠が。
A rope, a rope trap. A rope trap from Holo-zo.

739
00:43:45,564 --> 00:43:50,630
大丈夫かな。えー、吾輩回すのめんどくさい。
I wonder if we'll be okay. Ugh, I don't want to be the one swinging it.

740
00:43:50,764 --> 00:43:54,464
あ、じゃあ、ここはお姉さん組で。そうだね。
Ah, then how about the older sister group takes that role? Good idea.

741
00:43:54,597 --> 00:43:59,164
坂又飛ぶでござるよ。えー、飛ばなきゃいけないの？
Sakamata, you're jumping. Ugh, I have to jump?

742
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:03,530
え、坂又苦手なの？え、いや、得意でござる。
Wait, Sakamata, are you bad at this? Oh, no, I'm great at it.

743
00:44:03,664 --> 00:44:07,530
嘘つき。お姉さん、生きるの辞めろよ、もう。大丈夫だって。
Liar. Sis, just give up on life already. It'll be fine.

744
00:44:07,664 --> 00:44:12,397
すぐ生きる辞めるやん。え、ちょっと、最後でいい？怖いから。いいよ。
You're always giving up on life. Can I go last? I'm scared. Sure.

745
00:44:12,497 --> 00:44:17,497
あ、怖くない、怖くないけど最後。風間から入って、ラプ、殿、の順？
I'm not scared, I'm not, but I'll go last. So, Kazama enters first, then Lap, then Master?

746
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:22,597
いいよ。そう、一番最初が一番きついと思うから。この辺は任せるでござる、風間に。
Alright. Yeah, I think going first is the toughest part. I'll leave this to Kazama.

747
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:27,530
マジで怖くなってきた。いろはに任せようかな。全部いろはでいいじゃん、もう。
I'm getting really scared. Maybe I'll leave it all to Iroha. Let's just have Iroha do everything.

748
00:44:27,664 --> 00:44:32,397
じゃあ、いろは、ラプラス、クロヱの順ね。分かった。
Then the order will be Iroha, Laplus, Chloe. Got it.

749
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:38,397
あれだよ、クロヱ、頑張って入らないと。あ、そうだ。クロヱが入らないと1回にならないから。そうだね、早く入ってこいよ。
Listen, Chloe, you have to work hard to jump in. Ah, that's right. It doesn't count as one jump until Chloe is in. Right, so jump in quickly.

750
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:44,264
入ってから1回だよ。嘘、そうなの？そう。え、皆で飛ぶんだもんね、これ。オッケー、坂又頑張るよ。
It's one jump after you're in. What, really? Yeah. Well, we're all jumping together, after all. Okay, Sakamata will do her best.

751
00:44:44,397 --> 00:44:49,530
とりあえず、大縄跳びスタート！
Anyway, long rope jumping, start!

752
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,430
じゃあ、行きますよ。はい。
Alright, here we go. Yes.

753
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:55,530
ほい！はい！早い早い早い！
Hup! Yes! Quick, quick, quick!

754
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,597
早く来い！あ、クロヱ、クロヱ、縄、縄！
Hurry up and come in! Ah, Chloe, Chloe, the rope, the rope!

755
00:46:01,956 --> 00:46:04,025
やるじゃないですか。
Not bad, are you?

756
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:06,761
我が輩たち、運動神経よすぎ。よかった、よかった。
Our athletic nerves are too good. Good, good.

757
00:46:09,397 --> 00:46:11,465
じゃあ、2人で我が輩回してあげるよ。
Then, two of you turn the rope for me.

758
00:46:11,565 --> 00:46:13,367
えっ、でも私、いつも飛んでるからな。
Wait, but I'm always jumping.

759
00:46:13,467 --> 00:46:16,204
頼む、回して、我が輩も回したいよ。
Please, let me turn it, I want to turn it too.

760
00:46:16,304 --> 00:46:17,873
じゃあ、もう一回やる？
Then, want to do it again?

761
00:46:17,973 --> 00:46:19,507
回して、回して。
Turn it, turn it.

762
00:46:19,607 --> 00:46:21,109
で、いろはもやってみたかった？
And Iroha, did you want to try too?

763
00:46:21,209 --> 00:46:22,577
やってみたかった！OK!
I wanted to try! OK!

764
00:46:23,178 --> 00:46:24,546
風真も飛ぶね！
Kazama will jump too!

765
00:46:28,216 --> 00:46:32,053
次はこれでまた10回できたら凄くないか？
Won't it be amazing if we can do 10 times again like this?

766
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:35,056
いろは、疲れてる？
Iroha, are you tired?

767
00:46:35,223 --> 00:46:37,525
あ、全然大丈夫でござるよ。
Ah, I'm perfectly fine.

768
00:46:37,926 --> 00:46:40,028
お前、疲れとか知らんのか。
You, don't you know what fatigue is?

769
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:46,501
じゃあ、ちょっとお言葉に甘えて、いろは、ルイ、こよりでいこうか。
Then, I'll take you up on that, let's go with Iroha, Lui, and Koyori.

770
00:46:48,436 --> 00:46:50,605
我が輩と沙花叉で回すから。
Me and Sakamata will turn the rope.

771
00:46:51,973 --> 00:46:54,075
思い出作りや、思い出作り。
Making memories, making memories.

772
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,279
じゃ、行くぞ。せーの！
Then, here we go. One, two!

773
00:47:38,596 --> 00:47:40,531
やるじゃないですか。
Not bad, are you?

774
00:47:40,632 --> 00:47:45,436
すごいね。やるじゃないか。2回目、2回目。2回目ね。
Amazing. Not bad. The second time, the second time. Second time, right.

というわけで、秘密結社holoXの配信を終えさせていただきます。
And so, we'll be ending the secret society HoloX stream.

じゃあ、最後にカッコいいところ見せてもらいましょう。
Then, let's see something cool at the end.

778
00:48:10,595 --> 00:48:12,430

知らない
I don't know.

861

ボリュームを一つも
Don't turn down

一緒に飾ってほしいね。
I'd love for people to display it.

921
00:58:55,088 --> 00:58:59,088
このポーズもみんなで一生懸命考えたんだよね。
We all worked hard thinking up these poses, right?

922
00:58:59,088 --> 00:59:04,088
みんな写真撮られるって言ってウキウキだったね。
Everyone was so excited about getting their picture taken.

923
00:59:04,088 --> 00:59:08,088
前で座る？とか後ろ？とか言って。
We were like, "Should I sit in front?" or "Should I be in back?"

924
00:59:08,088 --> 00:59:13,088
考えただけあってめちゃくちゃ揃っててカッコイイ！
It looks so cool and coordinated, probably because we thought about it so much!

925
00:59:13,088 --> 00:59:20,588
我ら！って感じだね。こちらもぜひ手に入れてくれ！
It really captures our vibe. Please be sure to get one!

It's the box we use in our hideout, and we've mass-produced them for all you holoXers too!

929
00:59:36,088 --> 00:59:39,088
ありがたき幸せ！お菓子入れるじゃん。
We're so grateful! I'm gonna put snacks in it.

930
00:59:39,088 --> 00:59:43,088
ふざけんな！お菓子とか言うなよ！
Don't be silly! Don't say things like snacks!

931
00:59:43,088 --> 00:59:49,088
お揃いなんだからね。お菓子とか言うなよ、秘密だぞ。
We're matching, you know. Don't mention snacks, it's a secret.

932
00:59:49,088 --> 00:59:54,088
まあとにかくみんな手に入れてくれよな！
Anyway, I hope everyone gets their hands on one!

933
00:59:54,088 --> 00:59:59,954
ということで、次が最後の曲だ！
And with that, our next song will be the last one!

934
01:00:00,696 --> 01:00:03,596
行け！ あー！
Go! Aaaah!

935
01:00:45,396 --> 01:00:50,896
昨日も今日も晴天で　入道雲を見ていた
Yesterday and today were clear, I was watching the cumulonimbus clouds.

936
01:00:50,896 --> 01:00:55,896
怠いくらいの快晴だ　目を細めて
A clear day, so bright it's tiring; narrowing my eyes.

937
01:00:56,296 --> 01:01:01,396
それはどうも簡単に　思い出せやしないようで
It seems I can't recall it that easily.

938
01:01:01,396 --> 01:01:06,596
年を取った現状に　浸ってたんだよ
I was soaking in the reality of getting older.

939
01:01:17,096 --> 01:01:22,096
大人ぶった作戦で　不思議な合図送って
With a plan like we're grown-ups, sending mysterious signals.

940
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:27,096
「行こうか、今日も戦争だ」　立ち向かって手を取った
"Shall we go? Today's a battle too." We faced it and took each other's hands.

941
01:01:27,596 --> 01:01:32,696
理不尽なんて当然で　独りを強いられたって
Absurdity is only natural, even if forced into loneliness.

942
01:01:32,696 --> 01:01:37,896
迷った僕は憂鬱に　なりそうになってさ
Lost and confused, I was about to fall into melancholy.

943
01:01:38,296 --> 01:01:43,396
背高草（せたかそう）を分けて　滲む太陽睨んで
Pushing through the tall grass, glaring at the blurring sun.

944
01:01:43,396 --> 01:01:45,396
君がさ、こう言ったんだ
And then you said this.

945
01:01:45,396 --> 01:01:47,896
「孤独だったらおいでよ」
"If you're lonely, come on over."

946
01:01:48,096 --> 01:01:53,196
騒がしい坂を越して　生まれた感情さえも
Even the emotions born from crossing that noisy slope...

947
01:01:53,196 --> 01:01:58,196
頭に浮かんで沈んだ　「わがまますぎるかなぁ」
...floated into my head and sank: "Is this too selfish?"

948
01:01:58,296 --> 01:02:03,696
秘密基地に集まって　「楽しいね」って単純な
Gathering at the secret base, "This is fun," such simple...

949
01:02:03,696 --> 01:02:08,896
あの頃を思い出して　話をしよう
...memories of those days; let's talk about them.

950
01:02:08,996 --> 01:02:14,096
飛行機雲飛んでって　「眩しいね」って泣いていた
The vapor trail flew away, "It's so bright," we were crying.

951
01:02:14,096 --> 01:02:21,096
君はどんな顔だっけ　何故だろう、思い出せないな
What kind of face did you have? Why is it that I can't remember?

952
01:02:40,096 --> 01:02:45,396
痛いくらい現実は　足早に駆け抜けた
Reality dashed past so fast it almost hurt.

953
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:50,396
選んだ今日は平凡で　崩れそうになる日々を
The today I chose is ordinary, these days that feel like they're crumbling.

954
01:02:50,596 --> 01:02:55,296
昨日も今日は延長戦　大人だって臆病だ
Yesterday and today are extra innings, even adults are cowards.

955
01:02:55,396 --> 01:03:00,396
今になってはなんとなく　気付けたみたいだよ
I think I've finally realized that now.

956
01:03:00,696 --> 01:03:05,896
廻る世界のイデア　枯れる太陽　炎天下
The idea of the revolving world, the withering sun, under the blazing heat.

957
01:03:06,396 --> 01:03:11,496
陽炎が揺らいだ　「忘れないでさ、進もう」
The heat haze shimmered, "Don't forget, let's move forward."

958
01:03:11,596 --> 01:03:16,496
櫨（もど）かしい蝉時雨　明日を夢に見ていた
The frustrating chorus of cicadas, I was dreaming of tomorrow.

959
01:03:16,596 --> 01:03:21,596
戻らない先のある世界へ　僕たちで変えよう
To a world with a future we can't return from, let's change it ourselves.

960
01:03:21,896 --> 01:03:24,396
「思い出して、終わったって」
"Remember, even if it's over."

961
01:03:24,396 --> 01:03:26,896
秘密基地も冒険も
The secret base and the adventures.

962
01:03:26,896 --> 01:03:29,396
あの日に迷い込んだ
That day we wandered into...

963
01:03:29,396 --> 01:03:31,896
話し合うことも
...talking with each other too.

964
01:03:31,896 --> 01:03:34,396
独りぼっちが集まった
The lonely ones gathered together.

965
01:03:34,396 --> 01:03:36,896
子供たちの作戦が
The children's plan...

966
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:39,396
また今日も廻りだした
...has started revolving again today.

967
01:03:39,396 --> 01:03:41,896
「また、何処かで」
"See you again, somewhere."

968
01:03:42,396 --> 01:03:47,396
「涼しいね」って言い合った　夏空は透明だ
"It's cool, isn't it?" we said to each other, the summer sky is transparent.

969
01:03:47,396 --> 01:03:52,196
泣かないように吸い込んで　「サヨナラ」をしよう
Breathe it in so you don't cry, and let's say "Goodbye."

970
01:03:52,396 --> 01:03:57,396
秘密基地に集まって　笑い合った夏の日に
Gathering at the secret base, on that summer day we laughed together.

971
01:03:57,396 --> 01:04:02,596
「また何処かで」っと思い出して　出逢えるかな、なんて
"See you again somewhere," I remember, wondering if we'll meet again.

972
01:04:08,096 --> 01:04:12,096
何度でも　描こう
Let's draw it, again and again.

973
01:04:13,696 --> 01:04:16,896
