Yay! Yay! It's a festival! Look at all the stalls!

4
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,000
え、いっぱいなんかいろいろある。
Whoa, there's so many different things.

5
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
すごいすごい。何これ、いっぱいある。
Amazing, amazing. Look at all this stuff!

6
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,500
チョコバナナ！チョコバナナ！
Chocolate banana! Chocolate banana!

7
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,500
チョコバナナ食べたい！チョコバナナ食べたい！
I want to eat chocolate banana! Chocolate banana!

8
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,500
ねえ、その声はまずいって。
Hey, that voice is a bit much.

9
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,800
え、なんで？
Huh, why?

10
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,400
他のお客さんびっくりしちゃうから。いきなりこのテンションびっくりしちゃうから。
You'll surprise the other customers. They'll be shocked by this sudden energy.

11
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
チョコバナナ食べたい！チョコバナナ食べたい！
I want to eat chocolate banana! Chocolate banana!

12
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,200
チョコバナナ食べたい。チョコバナナあっちだよ、あっちあっち。
I want to eat chocolate banana. It's over there, that way.

13
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,000
天才のやつやって。ねね、やって、天才のやつやって。
Do the genius thing. Nene, do it, do the genius thing!

14
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,500
ちょっとフレームアウトしないで。ちょっとフレームアウトしないで。
Hey, don't go out of frame. Stop going out of frame!

15
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,600
えー、チョコバナナおいくつ必要ですか？
Um, how many chocolate bananas would you like?

16
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,500
え、３つで！３つ！
Um, three please! Three!

17
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,700
何色のチョコバナナがお好みですか？
What color chocolate banana would you like?

18
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,000
ピンク！
Pink!

19
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,300
ピンク！
Pink!

20
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,300
ピンク！
Pink!

21
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
じゃんけんで勝てばもう一本なんでしょ？
If we win at rock-paper-scissors, we get another one, right?

22
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,400
あ、そうだよ。
Oh, that's right.

23
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,400
じゃんけんぽい！
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

24
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
あ、後出しで負けるな。
Ah, you lost because you played late!

25
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,500
いつまでやるのこれ。もう始まるよ！
How long are we doing this? It's starting already!

26
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:21,000
皆さん！こんねぽらぼー！
Everyone! Kon-Nepolabo!

27
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,500
あ、待って、しろんの横が空いてるし。
Oh, wait, there's a gap next to Shiron.

28
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
何それ。もっと寄ればいい？
What? Should I move closer?

29
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,800
あ、もっと寄って。寄って寄って。
Yeah, move closer. Closer, closer.

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,800
ちょっとさ、この縁日のところに横に並ぶの、お客さんに迷惑じゃん。
Standing in a line like this at the festival stalls is bothering the customers.

31
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,500
いいじゃん、中段に立ってるんだから。
It's fine, we're standing in the middle row.

32
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,500
ライブの打ち合わせしてる人いないから。
There's no one here having a meeting for the live anyway.

33
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,800
はい、ということでね、自己紹介しますか。
Alright, well then, shall we introduce ourselves?

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
はーい！
Okay!

35
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,400
まずは、ねねちゃんから！
Starting with Nene-chan!

36
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:53,000
はーい！ねぽらぼのね！ホロライブ5期生、オレンジ担当、桃鈴ねねでーす！んねん！

Okay, the 'La' of NePoLaBo! Yukihana Lamy here! Kon-lamy!

Okay, and finally, the 'Bo' of NePoLaBo! Shishiro Botan here! La-lion!

40
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,800
イエーイ！
Yay!

41
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:25,500
ということでね、7月7日開催の、ホロライブ5期生ライブ「Twinkle 4 You」に向けて、ねぽらぼが大集合です！
So, here's NePoLaBo all together for the Hololive 5th Gen live concert, 'Twinkle 4 You', on July 7th!

42
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,400
イエーイ！
Yay!

43
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:41,000
ということでね、私たちなんですけれども、ちょっと夏を先取りして、今日は浴衣を着てみました！
So, even though it's a bit early for summer, we decided to wear yukata today!

44
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,000
見て見て！似合ってる？かわいい？
Look, look! Do they suit us? Are they cute?

45
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,000
ちょっとラミィ邪魔なんだけど！
Lamy, you're in the way!

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
ねえ！ヨーヨーかと思った！髪の毛！
Hey! I thought your hair was a yoyo!

47
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,833
進行してください、ちゃんと。
Please proceed properly.

48
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:06,233
えっ！おるかが一番真面目に今写真に向き合ってるのに何で怒られるの？
Eh! Why am I being scolded when I'm the one taking this most seriously right now?

49
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,333
あ、ちょっと読んでください先に。
Ah, please read this first.

50
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:10,933
進行からです。
Starting with the proceedings.

51
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:14,333
ね、可愛い、なんか、この丸いものは何だろうね？
Look, how cute. I wonder what this round thing is?

52
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,833
こんなものまで持っちゃってさあ。
Holding even something like this...

53
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:20,433
これ何？
What's this?

54
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:22,533
ちょっと待って、落ち着いて。
Wait a second, calm down.

55
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,733
落ち着いて、ポルカ。
Calm down, Polka.

56
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,433
真面目にやってください。
Please do this seriously.

57
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:33,433
何？何？気になると思うんですけど、ちょっと待って！
What? What? I know you're curious, but wait a minute!

58
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:37,333
これ後で、後でちゃんと説明するんで。
I'll explain this properly later.

59
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,833
配信を最後まで見てください。もう、邪魔なんで本当にやめてください。
Please watch the stream until the end. Seriously, stop it, you're in the way.

60
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:44,233
多分45分後くらいに説明あると思う。
I think there will be an explanation in about 45 minutes.

61
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,833
それまで、皆様見ててくださいね。
Until then, everyone please keep watching.

62
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:50,833
またあとで会おう。
See you later.

63
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:54,033
ねえねえ、浴衣伸びちゃうからやめなさいよ。
Hey, hey, stop that, you'll stretch the yukata.

64
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:57,333
ということで...
And so...

65
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:59,233
大丈夫？
Are you okay?

66
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:02,133
はい！先生！何ですか？
Yes! Teacher! What is it?

67
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:05,333
今日は一体何をするんですか？
What on earth are we doing today?

68
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,533
はい、よくぞ聞いてくれました。これで進めることができます。
Yes, thank you for asking. Now we can proceed.

69
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:17,333
皆様、ライブが開催される7月7日、何の日ですか？
Everyone, what day is July 7th, when the live concert will be held?

70
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:20,133
七夕ー！
Tanabata!

71
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:23,233
はい、よくできました。七夕です。
Yes, well done. It's Tanabata.

72
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:29,433
今日はね、七夕にかけて事前に皆様の悩みを募集いたしました。
Today, in connection with Tanabata, we have collected your troubles beforehand.

73
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,333
我々が何かやるんですか？
Are we going to do something?

74
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:36,433
そう、そうですそうです。
Yes, that's right.

75
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:37,933
聞いてくださいよ。
Please listen.

76
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:42,133
今日の企画は、いいですか？進めますよ。
Today's project is... Is it okay? I'm proceeding.

77
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:46,133
今日の企画は、悩みを願いに変えよう！
Today's project is: Let's turn troubles into wishes!

78
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,833
ねぽらぼ... せーの！
NePoLaBo... One, two!

79
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:52,433
ねぽらぼに願いをー！
Wishes to NePoLaBo!

80
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:59,033
大変だこりゃ。
This is going to be tough.

81
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:02,133
ということでね、皆様にいただいた悩みも...
And so, the troubles we received from everyone...

82
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:07,433
今日はね、ねぽらぼが4人で解決していきたいと思います。
Today, the four of us from NePoLaBo will solve them.

83
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,533
今日は七夕... 今日じゃないわ！ライブの日は七夕です。
Today is Tanabata... No, not today! The day of the live concert is Tanabata.

84
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:21,533
はしゃぎすぎちゃった。まあライブの日はね、七夕当日だからね。なんかご利益ありそう。
Got too excited. Well, the day of the live is Tanabata day itself. It seems like it'll bring good fortune.

85
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:25,533
あ、ご利益派、あ、私ご利益派。
Ah, "goriyaku" group? I'm in the "goriyaku" group.

86
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:29,833
ご利益派の尾丸ですね。
I'm Omaru of the "goriyaku" group.

87
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,433
いいですか？進めていいですか？
Is it okay? Can I proceed?

88
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:37,433
ということで今日は真面目に、真面目にお悩みを解決していきたいと思います。
So today, we want to seriously, seriously solve your troubles.

89
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:46,833
そしてお悩みが解決することをお祈りするので、皆様もよろしくお願いいたします、ちゃんと。
And we'll pray that your troubles are solved, so everyone, please join us properly.

90
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:51,333
じゃあとりあえず移動して...
Well, for now let's move...

91
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:56,433
皆様の悩みを解決するために移動しまーす！
Moving to solve everyone's troubles!

92
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,033
今日もねぽらぼは元気です！
NePoLaBo is energetic today as well!

93
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:29,133
皆様、いらっしゃいませ。
Welcome, everyone.

94
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:36,433
ということで、こちらに移動してまいりました。
And so, we've moved here.

95
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,433
今ね、みんな必死にずっと喋ってたっていうのがめちゃおもろいよね。
It's so funny how everyone was talking so desperately just now.

96
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:41,533
聞こえてたかな？
Could you hear us?

97
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:43,033
聞こえてたかな？
Could you hear us?

98
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:44,833
聞こえてたっぽいね。
It seems like they could.

99
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,533
気まずいな。
That's awkward.

100
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,833
ということで皆様、席に座ってください。
So everyone, please take your seats.

101
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,233
おっと、待て待て、どうした？
Whoa, wait, wait, what happened?

102
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,233
ねねさん、邪魔です。
Nene-san, you're in the way.

103
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,233
ねねさん、配信流れてますよ。
Nene-san, we're live.

104
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:01,333
勘弁してください。
Give me a break.

105
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:04,133
ねねがずっと椅子にコンロしてたから...
Because Nene was hovering over the chair...

106
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:08,533
ギリギリまでねねとかが暴れてたからね。
Nene and the others were rampaging until the very last second.

107
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:15,833
ハッシュタグ #ねぽらぼに願いを で寄せられたお悩みをみんな見ていきましょう。
Let's all look at the troubles sent in with the hashtag #WishesToNePoLaBo.

108
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:19,333
まずは、こちら！ドン！
First, this one! Boom!

109
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:25,133
はい、じゃあこちらねねさんに感情を込めて読んでいただきましょう。
Okay, let's have Nene-san read this with emotion.

110
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,133
ファンネーム、みかんさん。
Fan name, Mikan-san.

111
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:32,433
高校最後の体育祭で団長になってしまいました。
I became the group leader at the last sports festival of high school.

112
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:39,133
どうしても緊張するし、なんか責任感を感じてしまいます。
I can't help but feel nervous and somehow feel a sense of responsibility.

113
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:44,233
どうすればリラックスできますでしょうか？
How can I relax?

114
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:52,433
なるほど、ということでみかんさんは、団長になってしまったのでリラックスする方法を知りたいということですね。
I see. So Mikan-san wants to know how to relax after becoming the group leader.

115
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,433
さらされたな。
Exposed, huh.

116
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,233
言い方が悪い。
That's a bad way to put it.

117
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:59,433
空気に飲まれてて、あいついいじゃんみたいな。
Swallowed by the atmosphere, like "He's good".

118
00:10:01,345 --> 00:10:03,445
味噌持ってさ、うどん食べるしかねえべ。
Just grab some miso and eat some udon.

119
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:05,445
ちょっとあの、まだ挙手制なんで。
Wait, we're still doing hand-raising.

120
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:07,845
えー、ということでね。リラックスする方法ですよ。
So, it's about how to relax.

121
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:11,245
ちゃんと解決する方法考えてください。はい、誰かありますか？
Please think of a proper solution. Anyone?

122
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,045
お、早い。じゃあポルカさん。
Oh, fast. Okay, Polka-san.

123
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:16,845
責任を感じろ！リラックスなんてするな！
Feel the responsibility! Don't you dare relax!

124
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:19,445
一生団長を全うしろ！
Carry that burden of leadership for life!

125
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:23,545
厳しい... 厳しい団長だなあ。重い。圧が掛かっていますが。
Harsh... That's a strict leader. Heavy. There's a lot of pressure.

126
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:27,545
もうちょっと優しいね、寄り添った回答を。ねねさんどうぞ。
How about a gentler, more supportive answer? Nene-san, go ahead.

127
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,545
桃鈴ねねです！
I'm Momosuzu Nene!

128
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:35,045
団長なので、代わりにノエル先輩を召喚すればいいと思います！
Since you're the leader, I think you should just summon Noel-senpai instead!

129
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:40,545
ああ、いい。いい。これいいんじゃないですか？
Oh, nice. That's good. Isn't that great?

130
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:49,045
「ならされた系」だと言い方から思いますので、
From the way you put it, it sounds like you were "forced" into it,

131
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:53,045
何かあった場合、責任をその決めた人に押し付ければいいと...
so if anything happens, just shift the blame to whoever chose you...

132
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:57,445
そういう気分でリラックスしていけばいいと思います。
I think you can relax if you keep that mindset.

133
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:08,545
まあ、リラックスをするということで、皆さん普段どういう風に逆にされてるんですか？
Well, regarding relaxing, how do you all usually do it?

134
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:16,845
牧場に行きます！
I go to a ranch!

135
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:26,545
こういう時のリラックスの仕方は、もうゲームする。
My way of relaxing at times like this is just to play games.

136
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:31,045
なるほど。自分の好きなことね、それは。
I see. Doing what you love, then.

137
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:35,545
ちなみにポルカさんは普段... ちょっとやめてください、ポルカさん。
By the way, Polka-san, usually... Hey, stop it, Polka-san.

138
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:40,045
ポルカさんは普段はどういう風なリラックスをしてるんですか？
What kind of relaxing do you normally do, Polka-san?

139
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:44,245
これ。ねねを... 愛でる！
This. Doting on... Nene!

140
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:50,045
ああー、よしよし。よしよし。
There, there. Good girl.

141
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:58,545
リラックスするために自分の好きなことをして、
Do what you love to relax,

142
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:03,545
なおかつペットがいる場合はそれを愛でる。
and if you have a pet, dote on it.

143
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:12,545
ということでね。みかんさんが無事リラックスできますように！
So, I hope Mikan-san will be able to relax!

144
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:28,045
はい。ファンネーム、ゆたんぽさんから頂きました。
Yes. From fan name Yutanpo-san.

145
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:30,545
ねぽらぼライブが待ち遠しくて、
I'm so excited for the NePoLaBo live,

146
00:12:30,645 --> 00:12:34,045
夜しか眠れなくて困っています。
that I'm troubled because I can only sleep at night.

147
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:37,545
皆さんのオススメの安眠方法を教えてください！
Please tell me your recommended ways to sleep soundly!

148
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:40,545
めっちゃ寝てるじゃん、夜にちゃんと。
You're sleeping plenty then, if you're sleeping at night.

149
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:47,045
夜しか寝てねえ、お前ずっと寝てんじゃねえか、わははって。
You're only sleeping at night? You're sleeping all the time, haha!

150
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:59,545
我々結構、夜遅くまで配信したりするからさ、目が冴えちゃうんだよ。
We often stream until late at night, so we end up wide awake.

151
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:05,545
そう、でもラミィも結構12時に寝るけどね。
Yeah, but I usually go to bed around 12:00.

152
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:22,545
でもライブに向けて困ってるんだったら、僕たちにとっては嬉しい悩みですから、
But if you're troubled because of the live, it's a happy concern for us.

153
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:27,545
そのままの君でいてって感じだけど。
So I feel like saying just stay as you are.

154
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:40,545
ゆたんぽが眠れないくらい、楽しませるので、
We'll make it so fun that Yutanpo can't sleep,

155
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:46,045
いっぱい寝てください！
so please sleep a lot!

156
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:55,045
ガチで言うと、目元に温かいの載せるといいよ。
To be serious, putting something warm on your eyes helps.

157
00:13:55,145 --> 00:14:00,045
はい、じゃあゆたんぽさんが夜ゆっくり眠れますように！
Okay, I hope Yutanpo-san can sleep soundly at night!

158
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:20,545
あきやんさん。「4月から仕事の都合で数年海外へ行くことになりました。」
Akiyan-san: "Due to work, I'll be going abroad for a few years starting in April."

159
00:14:20,645 --> 00:14:26,545
「応援の一言をお願いします！」
Please give me a word of encouragement!"

160
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:38,545
頑張ってください！
Good luck!

161
00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:50,045
ねねのことをいっぱい考えながら、いっぱい頑張ってね！
Think about Nene a lot and do your very best!

162
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:59,045
電気のアンペアとか、気をつけてね。
Be careful with the electrical amperage and things like that.

163
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:04,057

4月から仕事の都合で数年海外へ行くことになりました
Fan name: Kakiyan△
Starting April, I'll be overseas for a few years for work.

164
00:15:04,057 --> 00:15:06,057
ねぽらぼの皆さんから新天地で頑張るリスナーさんへ応援の一言をお願いします！！！
Please give a word of support from NePoLaBo to a listener doing their best in a new environment!

165
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:07,557
え、ま、海外、この方は海外ですけど、
Well, overseas... this person is going overseas, but...

166
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:12,557
ま、新天地ということで引越しとかね、新しい、ま、環境に行くという方いらっしゃると思うので...
since it's a "new environment," I think there are others moving or starting in new surroundings...

167
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:16,557
とりあえず、洗濯機と冷蔵庫と炊飯器はいいやつ買うといいです。
For now, you should buy a good washing machine, fridge, and rice cooker.

168
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:17,557
ねえ！大事！
Right! That's important!

169
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:20,057
みんなガチなのよ。
Everyone's being so serious.

170
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:23,057
え、じゃあ、最後、大トリのラミィさん、お願いします。
Alright then, finally, Lamy-san, our grand finale, please go ahead.

171
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:27,057
かきやんさん。見て、ほら、雪民マークもついてるから。
Kakiyan-san. Look, see? There's even a Yukimin mark.

172
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:30,057
かきやんさん。頑張ってね。
Kakiyan-san. Do your best.

173
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:32,057
ラミィが応援してるよ。んー、まっ！
Lamy is rooting for you. Mwah!

174
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,557
あれ？あれ？
Huh? Huh?

175
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,557
何？
What?

176
00:15:34,557 --> 00:15:36,557
なんかなー。え、何何何？
Something's off... Wait, what, what, what?

177
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:38,557
なんか、そっちのラミィじゃない、
Like, not THAT Lamy,

178
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:41,057
最新の方のラミィでもう一回やって。
do it again as the LATEST Lamy.

179
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:43,057
いやいやいや、最新、何だよ、怖いよ、その顔。
No, no, no, "latest"? What are you talking about? That look is scary.

180
00:15:44,057 --> 00:15:45,557
あ、じゃあ、ちょっとねねが代わりにやってあげる。
Oh, then Nene will do it instead.

181
00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:46,557
いや、もう終わったから！
No, it's already over!

182
00:15:46,557 --> 00:15:48,557
きれいに締めたところを今...
I had just finished it so nicely...

183
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:50,557
かきやんさん！かきやんさん！
Kakiyan-san! Kakiyan-san!

184
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:52,557
頑張ってね！ポルカが応援してるよ！
Do your best! Polka is rooting for you!

185
00:15:52,557 --> 00:15:54,557
んー、まっ！
Mwah!

186
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:56,057
頑張ってボルー！
Go for it, Boru!

187
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:05,057
海外でも頑張ってください。
Please do your best overseas as well.

188
00:16:05,057 --> 00:16:06,557
頑張ってねー。
Good luck!

189
00:16:06,557 --> 00:16:08,557
頑張れー！
You can do it!

190
00:16:08,557 --> 00:16:11,057
ということで次のお悩みはこちら！
And with that, here is the next problem!

191
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:13,557
ファンネーム：西虹紫のチョコまかれの実兄△
5000兆円欲しい！！！！！
Fan name: Nishiniji Murasaki no Choco Makare no Jitsuni△
I want 5000 trillion yen!!!!!

192
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,057
はい、悩んでないですね。
Alright, that's not a worry.

193
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,557
はい、欲望丸出し。
Yeah, it's just pure greed.

194
00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:17,557
頑張ってください。あげませーん。
Good luck. We're not giving it to you.

195
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:23,057
頑張ってください、あげませーん。
Good luck, not giving it to you.

196
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:26,557
えっ、これはどうしましょうかね。頑張れ。
Um, what should we do with this? Good luck.

197
00:16:27,557 --> 00:16:31,057
じゃ、ししろ、ししろんからね、応援メッセージを。
Well then, Shishiro, Shishiron, give them a message of support.

198
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,557
甘えんじゃない！！
Don't be so pampered!!

199
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:37,057
ってか自力で稼げるようになってください。5000兆円。
I mean, please become able to earn it yourself. 5000 trillion yen.

200
00:16:37,557 --> 00:16:38,557
5000兆円！
5000 trillion yen!

201
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:40,557
自力で稼ぐのはちょっと無理じゃないですか？
Isn't earning that yourself a bit impossible?

202
00:16:41,057 --> 00:16:43,057
そしたらその時はお布施ください。
In that case, please give us a donation.

203
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:45,057
なんで、なんでポルカももらおうとしてんだよ。
Why, why is Polka trying to get some too?

204
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:47,057
ねねに3000兆円ください。
Please give Nene 3000 trillion yen.

205
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:49,057
なんで半分以上あげんだよ。
Why would they give you more than half?

206
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:51,057
すいません、すいません。本当に。ちょうだい。
Sorry, sorry. Seriously. Give it to me.

207
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:53,057
はい、次のお悩みいきますよ！
Alright, moving on to the next problem!

208
00:16:54,057 --> 00:16:56,557
頑張りましょうねー。はい、次のお悩みはこちら！
Let's do our best. Okay, here's the next problem!

209
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,057
ファンネーム：すん△
私は、勤務時間が長い仕事に就いています。
Fan name: Sun△
I have a job with long working hours.

210
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:04,057
そんな中で推し活もしたいし、寝る時間も欲しいしで、24時間じゃ足りない状態です！
上手な時間の使い方をぜひ教えていただければ幸いです！
I want to do fan activities and sleep, so 24 hours isn't enough!
I'd appreciate it if you could tell me how to manage my time well!

211
00:16:58,057 --> 00:16:59,057
ありがとうね、おまる。
Thank you, Omaru.

212
00:16:59,057 --> 00:17:00,557
ファンネーム、ぜるえるさん。
Fan name, Zeluel-san.

213
00:17:00,557 --> 00:17:04,057
ぜるえるさんじゃないな。すん、すんさんだ、それ。
It's not Zeluel-san. It's Sun, Sun-san.

214
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:08,557
ぜるえるさん、はい。私は、勤務時間が長い仕事に就いています。
Zeluel-san... Okay. I have a job with long working hours.

215
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:13,557
そんな中で推し活もしたいし、寝る時間も欲しいので、
I want to do fan activities and get some sleep,

216
00:17:13,557 --> 00:17:18,057
24時間で足りない状態です。
so 24 hours is just not enough.

217
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:22,057
上手な時間の使い方をぜひ教えていただければ幸いです。
I would be happy if you could tell me how to use my time effectively.

218
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:24,057
なるほどねー。
I see.

219
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:27,557
これもちらが聞きたい案件だけどね。
That's something we'd like to know too.

220
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:30,557
やめてください。今日はねぽらぼが解決するんです。
Please stop. Today, NePoLaBo is going to solve it.

221
00:17:31,557 --> 00:17:35,557
寝る時間も欲しい... ま、でも、24時間じゃ足りない。
Wanting sleep... Well, but 24 hours isn't enough.

222
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:38,557
これはね、やはり時間というものは有限。
You see, time is ultimately finite.

223
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:40,557
あ、はい！
Oh, me!

224
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:41,557
はい、ねねさん。
Yes, Nene-san.

225
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:46,557
はい。枕にスピーカーをつけて、え、寝ながら...
Yes. Put a speaker on your pillow and, well, while sleeping...

226
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:48,057
睡眠学習？
Sleep learning?

227
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:51,057
寝ながら配信を見ればいいと思います。
I think you should watch streams while you sleep.

228
00:17:51,557 --> 00:17:53,057
レム睡眠の時に覚えるやつね。
The kind where you learn during REM sleep.

229
00:17:53,057 --> 00:17:54,557
反論です。それは...
I object. That is...

230
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:56,557
ディベートじゃないんでやめてください。
This isn't a debate, so please stop.

231
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:58,557
目は見えないと思います、それでは。
I don't think your eyes can see that way.

232
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:00,557
耳でしか聞けない。質問はどう？
You can only hear with your ears. How about the question?

233
00:18:01,057 --> 00:18:02,557
はい、異議あり！
Yes, objection!

234
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:06,557
推しの可愛い姿は脳内補充できます。
You can supplement the cute image of your fave in your brain.

235
00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:09,557
あ、おまるさん静かになった。
Oh, Omaru-san went quiet.

236
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:11,057
これじゃないですか？
Isn't this it?

237
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,057
これ以上はちょっと、あの、場外乱闘で
Any more than this will have to be a match outside the ring,

238
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:16,557
後ほどねねと、あの、ディベートするんでよろしくお願いします。
I'll be debating Nene later, so look forward to it.

239
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:19,557
ということでね、ちょっとカメラさんこっち向いていただいて、
Anyway, Mr. Cameraman, please look this way,

240
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,057
その後にね、場外乱闘していただいて...
and then let them have their match outside...

241
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:24,057
良いよ、今やってて。
It's fine, go ahead and do it now.

242
00:18:33,557 --> 00:18:37,057
はい、なんですかこれ。解決方法結局何なんですか？
Okay, what is this? What's the solution after all?

243
00:18:37,557 --> 00:18:40,057
えーと、タイムマシンに乗ればいいと思います。
Um, I think they should ride a time machine.

244
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:42,557
何言ってんだよ。もうちょっとマシなんないの？
What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better?

245
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:45,557
えー、これは解決方法はない。
Well, there is no solution.

246
00:18:46,057 --> 00:18:48,057
上手な時間の使い方でしょ、でも。
But the question was about effective time management.

247
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:49,057
何ですか？
What is it?

248
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:52,057
もうこれはスケジュールを組むしかないですよね。
At this point, you just have to make a schedule.

249
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:54,057
ねえ、正論パンチやめて。
Hey, stop with the logic punch.

250
00:18:55,057 --> 00:18:57,057
スケジュール組めじゃない。スケジュール組みましょう。
Don't just say "make a schedule." Let's make a schedule.

251
00:18:57,057 --> 00:19:00,057
組めてない。何時から何時は配信を見る時間、
They haven't made one. From this time to that time is for watching streams,

252
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:02,057
何時から何時は...
from this time to that time is...

253
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,057
もうそれしかない。一生懸命なんだ。
That's all there is to it. They're working hard.

254
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:07,557
え、じゃああれじゃない？ちょっとししろんはすんさんに
Well, then, why don't you,

255
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:10,557
ちょっとスケジュール組めと喝入れてあげたほうが良いんじゃない？
give Sun-san a pep talk and tell them to make a schedule?

256
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:10,557
そうだね、喝を。
Right, a pep talk.

257
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:13,557
喝。じゃあ、まずね、この勤務時間が長い仕事、
Pep talk. Okay, first of all, this job with long hours,

258
00:19:13,557 --> 00:19:17,057
この勤務時間長い仕事変えてください。
please change this job with long hours.

259
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:18,557
転職！？
A career change!?

260
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,057
短縮してください。
Please shorten them.

261
00:19:21,557 --> 00:19:23,557
じゃあ、お願いします、そこで、じゃあ。
Well then, please do that there.

262
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:25,557
じゃあ、お願いします、可愛く。
Okay, please do it cutely.

263
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:30,057
じゃ、まあ、仕事あんまり無理せず頑張ってください。
Well, please do your best at work without overdoing it.

264
00:19:30,557 --> 00:19:33,557
願い叶いますように。仕事が、じゃあ
May your wish come true. May your work hours,

265
00:19:33,557 --> 00:19:36,557
勤務時間短くなりますように。はい。
well, may your working hours become shorter. Yes.

266
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:40,057
ありがとうございます。はい、次のお悩みはこちら！
Thank you very much. Okay, here's the next problem!

267
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,057
ファンネーム：Tara-kuma△🍅
7月7日ですが私の誕生日なのですが
Fan name: Tara-kuma△🍅
July 7th is my birthday,

268
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:48,057
今年の誕生日は何をして過ごせばハッピーになると思いますか？
what do you think I should do on my birthday this year to be happy?

269
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:49,057
ファンネーム、タラクマさんですかね。
The fan name is Tara-kuma-san, I believe.

270
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:53,557
ありがとうございます。7月7日ですが、私の誕生日ですと。
Thank you. It says July 7th is their birthday.

271
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:54,557
おめでとう！
Happy birthday!

272
00:19:55,057 --> 00:20:00,057
今年の誕生日は何をして過ごせばハッピーになると思いますか？これはもう...
What should they do to be happy on their birthday this year? Well, this is...

273
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:01,369
ふりですよ。
It's a setup.

274
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:01,869
ふり？
A setup?

275
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:03,569
え？すごいの？
Eh? Is it amazing?

276
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,469
本当にふりから...
Really from the setup...

277
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:06,569
ふりですよ。
It's a setup.

278
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:08,069
何し過ごせばいいんだ？
What should I do?

279
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:09,569
あー、えっと...
Ah, well...

280
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:11,869
何見てんだよお前！
What are you looking at!

281
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:13,869
いや、そこは答えろ。
No, answer it.

282
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:17,569
ねぽらぼライブを見たらいいと思うんです！
I think you should watch the NePoLaBo live!

283
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:20,069
イエーイ！素晴らしい！
Yay! Wonderful!

284
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:22,569
ということでね、ねぽらぼライブ見てください。
So, please watch the NePoLaBo live.

285
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:24,569
じゃあ、ねねちゃん可愛く、叶いますようにしてあげてください。
Now, Nene-chan, do it cutely and make a wish for them.

286
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:27,569
たらくまさんの願いが叶って、
I hope Tara-kuma's wish comes true,

287
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:30,069
素敵なライブが見れますようにー！
and you can see a wonderful live!

288
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:31,569
んっー！
Mwah!

289
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,069
あー可愛い！それ、私の仕事なんだよな。
Ah, so cute! That's my job though.

290
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:37,569
確かに。俺たちが頑張らないと。
True. We have to work hard.

291
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:40,069
ま、ね、4人で頑張りましょう。
Well, let's all 4 work hard.

292
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:43,069
たらくまさんが素敵な誕生日になるようにね。待ってるよー！
I hope Tara-kuma has a wonderful birthday. We're waiting for you!

293
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:46,069
はい、ということで次のお悩みこちら！
Alright, so here's the next concern!

294
00:20:47,069 --> 00:21:06,069
人の顔と名前を覚えるのが苦手です。どうやったら覚えられるようになりますか？
I'm bad at remembering people's faces and names. How can I learn to remember them?

295
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:54,069
えっと、ド・ドナドナツのミさん...
Well, Do-na Do-natsu no Mi-san...

296
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:57,069
ポルカさん、読んであげてください。
Polka-san, please read it.

297
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:59,569
えー、サインかお前！
Is it an autograph!

298
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:02,069
人の顔と名前を覚えるのが苦手です。
I'm bad at remembering people's faces and names.

299
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:05,569
どうやったら覚えられるようになりますか？
How can I learn to remember them?

300
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,569
畏まり。なるほど、これ、みんな得意？
Understood. I see, are you guys good at this?

301
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:10,569
いや、ラミめちゃめちゃ苦手だね。
No, Lamy is really bad at it.

302
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,569
どういう感じで覚えていくのがいいのかな？
What's a good way to remember them?

303
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:14,569
これ得意な人、逆にいる？この中で。
Is anyone here actually good at it?

304
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:15,569
私、無理。
Not me.

305
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:18,069
ねー。あのね、顔はすごい覚える。
Right. Well, I remember faces really well.

306
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,569
喋ってる内容と顔は覚えるのに、
I remember the face and what we talked about,

307
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:24,069
名前だけなんか覚えられないんだよ。
but for some reason I just can't remember the name.

308
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:26,569
なるほどね。そうそう。ちなみに二人は？
I see. Exactly. By the way, what about you two?

309
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:30,069
ねねはなんか、頭の中で渾名つけて。
For Nene, I like, give them a nickname in my head.

310
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:33,069
あー。それ言っちゃわない？言っちゃう。
Ah. Do you ever say it out loud? I do.

311
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:36,069
ダメだよ、それ！
Don't do that!

312
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:41,569
なるほど。までもその紐付けるっていうのはね、記憶としては正しいからね。
I see. But associating things is the right way for memory.

313
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:44,569
なんか特徴的なこととかね。すごく... 特徴とか。
Like something characteristic. Very... characteristics.

314
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:48,569
これは、えっと、このまま解決策まで話しちゃいますけど...
As for this, well, I'll go ahead and talk about the solution...

315
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:52,569
えっと、相手も覚えてないことがあります。
Well, sometimes the other person doesn't remember either.

316
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:56,069
あー、なるほど。逆に。聞きたい聞きたい、それ。
Ah, I see. The other way around. I want to hear that.

317
00:21:56,569 --> 00:21:58,569
えっと、あ、あ、尾丸ポルカです！
Uh, ah, ah, I'm Omaru Polka!

318
00:21:58,569 --> 00:21:59,369
あ、はい。
Ah, yes.

319
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:04,069
あ、ああ、尾丸ポルカです。あ、ごめんなさい、これ即興が始まってたんです、今。
Ah, ah, I'm Omaru Polka. Ah, sorry, an improvisation just started.

320
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:06,069
すみません。
Excuse me.

321
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:08,069
あ、尾丸ポルカです。あ、ああ、どうも雪花ラミです。
Ah, I'm Omaru Polka. Ah, ah, hello, I'm Yukihana Lamy.

322
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:12,069
あ、この前はあの、あれですよね。あのー、ね！
Ah, you're the one from before... that... right? Uh... right!

323
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:14,569
本当楽しかったですよね、あの時。ですね、またよろしくお願いします。
That was really fun back then. It was, I look forward to working with you again.

324
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:18,069
これですよ。なるほど。相手に言わせる。もうこれしかない。
This is it. I see. Make the other person say it. This is the only way.

325
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:21,069
いいじゃん。自分から名前を言って相手に言わせる。
That's good. Say your name first and make the other person say theirs.

326
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:24,069
言わせるってことか。そういうこと。
Make them say it. Exactly.

327
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:28,069
これはとてもいいと思います。相手が分かってないんだろうなって気を遣う、もう自分の中で自分を騙す。
I think this is very good. Consider that the other person might not know, and deceive yourself.

328
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:32,069
なるほど。自分からも自己紹介を先に始めちゃえば、
I see. If you start your self-introduction first,

329
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:34,569
もし相手が自分のことを忘れちゃってても...
even if the other person has forgotten you...

330
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:39,069
この前はお世話になりました、尾丸ポルカですってね。そう、そうそう。
Say "Thank you for your help the other day, I'm Omaru Polka." Right, exactly.

331
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:42,569
それは素晴らしい！さすがですよ。
That's wonderful! As expected.

332
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:45,569
ということで、じゃあ、ポルカさん、お願いしたげてください。
Alright, so Polka-san, please make a wish for them.

333
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:48,069
ド・ドナドナツのミのそちらのへー！
To that Do-na Do-natsu no Mi over there!

334
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:51,569
ド・ドナドナツのミの名前、
I hope Do-na Do-natsu no Mi can remember names,

335
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:55,069
人と顔が覚えられますように、ポルカの解決案で、よろしくお願いします！ハッ！
people, and faces, with Polka's solution, please! Ha!

336
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:56,869
強い。キレ綺麗だな。
Strong. That was sharp.

337
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:00,069
はい、ありがとうございました。叶いますように。
Yes, thank you very much. May it come true.

338
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:03,069
ということでね、次のお悩みはこちら！
And so, the next concern is this!

339
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:47,569
身近にホロライブをしている人がいなく語ることができません。どうしたらいいでしょうか？
There is no one around me who knows Hololive, so I can't talk about it. What should I do?

340
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:10,069
お、ししろおしーということで、じゃあ、ししろん読んでください。
Oh, a Shishiro fan, so Shishiron, please read it.

341
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:13,569
ラライト。ラライト、ししろおしさん。はい。
raraito. raraito, Shishiro fan-san. Yes.

342
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:18,069
えーさ、身近にホロライブをしている人がいなく...
Uh, "there is no one around me who DOES Hololive"...

343
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:20,069
している？知っている人。言っちゃった。
Doing? Someone who knows. I said it.

344
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:24,069
知っている人って言いたい。言いたいだろう。知っている人。
She wants to say someone who knows. She probably wants to. Someone who knows.

345
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:29,069
身近のホロライブ... 知っている人が。
Around me, Hololive... someone who knows.

346
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:33,569
いなくて語ることができません。どうしたらいいでしょうか。
There is no one, so I can't talk about it. What should I do?

347
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:39,069
ホロライブな。何が崩れたらこれ壊すぞ。ダメだよ、維持して！
Hololive, huh? If anything falls apart, this will break. No, keep it together!

348
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:42,569
おー、ブレインが崩れたら終わりぞ。ごめんなさい。
Oh, if the brain collapses, it's over. Sorry.

349
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:47,569
え、かなりのコミュ障でネット界でも話すことができません。はい。というお悩みです。
Uh, "I'm quite socially anxious and can't even talk online." Yes. That's the concern.

350
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:52,069
なるほど、身近に、まあホロライブファンがちょっといなくて、
I see, there are no Hololive fans nearby,

351
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:55,069
直接その、一緒に語り合いたいっていうのができないみたい。
so they can't talk together directly.

352
00:23:55,869 --> 00:24:00,069
でもさ、これ逆に、もう推しのこのししろの良さを自分の友達に推し布教してあげればいいんじゃないの？
But you know, couldn't you just preach the greatness of your oshi, Shishiro, to your own friends?

353
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:03,069
推し布教。確かに。「この子知ってる？」
Oshi-preaching. True. "Do you know this girl?"

354
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:04,569
え、でも待って待って待って！
Uh, but wait wait wait!

355
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:10,569
カッコがついてるよ、これ。「かなりコミュ障でネット界でも話すことができません」って書いてある。
There are parentheses here. It says "I'm quite socially anxious and can't even talk online."

356
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:15,569
これはでもね、あの、あれじゃないかな。やっぱり共通の趣味を持ってる人っていうのは...
But you know, well, maybe it's this. People who have a common hobby...

357
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:22,069
もう一言自分が、え、実は自分、獅白ぼたん推してて、ってなったらもう、そっから盛り上がっちゃうわけよ。
Once you say even one word like "Actually, I support Shishiro Botan", things will just heat up from there.

358
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:27,569
あれじゃない？ハッシュタグつければいいんじゃない？「今日も暇だな #ししろ好きと繋がりたい」
What about this? Why not use a hashtag? "I'm free today #WantToConnectWithShishiroFans"

359
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:30,569
それだ！なるほどね。までもそれも勇気だよね。そこから踏み出す。
That's it! I see. But that takes courage too. To take that step.

360
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:37,569
までも結構ホロライブのさ、このDiscordサーバーとかさ、ファンサーバーみたいな。
But you know, there are Hololive Discord servers and fan servers.

361
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:42,569
それがだからたぶん苦手なんだって。分かってるよ私は。だからありがとよ。
That's probably what they're bad at. I understand. So, thanks.

362
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:46,069
今ホロライブの公式の方でもさ、ホロライブファン向けのアプリ作ってたりしてるから、
Right now, Hololive Official is making an app for Hololive fans,

363
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:53,069
ちょっとそういうのを今後活用していってもらったらいいんじゃないかなって、ちょっと会社のね、よいしょはしておきます。
so I think it would be good if you could use something like that in the future... I'll just give the company a little boost.

364
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:57,069
よいしょよいしょ。ホロプラス活用しとこうぜ。
Heave-ho, heave-ho. Let's use Holoplus.

365
00:24:57,069 --> 00:24:59,069
そうだよ、ホロプラス活用せえ。
That's right, use Holoplus.

366
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:05,181
（賑やかな話し声）
(Lively chatter)

367
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:06,681
解決方法をね、お伝えください。
Please tell us your solution.

368
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:10,081
じゃあ、raraitoさん、えー、ホロライブアプリなど、
Well, raraito-san, you can use the Hololive app

369
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:15,581
色々ね、することができますので、そちらの方、活用してください。
to do various things, so please make use of it.

370
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:18,081
はい、ということで次の悩みはこちら！
Alright, the next concern is this!

371
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,481
デデン！
Ta-da!

372
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:22,581
お、あ、ジサバチさんですね、はい。
Oh, it's Jisabachi-san, yes.

373
00:25:23,581 --> 00:25:26,581
え、レギルス中佐さん、中尉さん。ごめんなさい。
Um, Regulus Lt. Col... Lt. Sorry.

374
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:30,881
めっちゃ崩れまくってますね。はい。えー、ねぽらぼへ。
I'm totally messing it up. Yes. Um, to NePoLaBo.

375
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:34,581
ねぽらぼへ、なーんだと。果たし状みたいなのこれ。
To NePoLaBo... What? Is this a challenge letter?

376
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:38,281
何でしょうか。えー、チケットを当てるために
What is it? Um, 'I want to accumulate good karma'

377
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:43,081
徳を積んでおきたいのですが、何をすればよろしいでしょうか。
'to win a ticket, what should I do?'

378
00:25:46,381 --> 00:25:50,081
おお、なるほど。これは、じゃあ一人ずつ言っていこうか。
Oh, I see. Well then, let's each give an answer.

379
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,581
何やってんの、何やってんの？
What are you doing? What are you doing?

380
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:53,381
積んでるんだよ、徳を。
I'm accumulating karma.

381
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:55,581
賽の河原みたいじゃん。やめなさいよ、縁起悪いじゃない。
It's like the children's limbo. Stop it, that's bad luck.

382
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:58,581
俺が崩しちゃった。やめなさい、やめなさい。
I knocked it down. Stop it, stop it.

383
00:25:58,581 --> 00:26:03,081
ということで、一人ずつ、ねねさんからちょっと言っていただきましょうか。
So, let's have everyone share one by one, starting with Nene-san.

384
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:04,581
はい！
Yes!

385
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:07,581
え、トイレには神様がいるらしいので、
Well, they say there's a god in the toilet,

386
00:26:07,581 --> 00:26:09,581
トイレ掃除をすればいいと思います！
so I think you should clean the toilet!

387
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:13,581
あー、なるほどね。いいと思う。すごい。トイレの、トイレの神様って何してくれるの？
Ah, I see. I think that's good. Amazing. What does the toilet god do for you?

388
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:17,381
やめなさい、あんた。いいじゃない、徳を積むのよ。夢を叶えてくれるのよ。あ、そうなの。
Stop that. It's fine, you're accumulating karma. They'll grant your dreams. Oh, really?

389
00:26:17,381 --> 00:26:19,081
ポルカさん。
Polka-san.

390
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:21,081
親孝行！
Filial piety!

391
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:24,581
あ、いい、とってもいい。いい。いい。トイレ掃除、親孝行。
Ah, nice, very nice. Good. Toilet cleaning and filial piety.

392
00:26:24,581 --> 00:26:27,581
もうこれで十分なのでは？まだまだ足りないよ。分かりました。
Isn't that enough already? It's not enough yet. Understood.

393
00:26:27,581 --> 00:26:29,081
じゃあラミィ言います。
Then Lamy will say one.

394
00:26:29,081 --> 00:26:31,081
自分を大切にする。
Take care of yourself.

395
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:34,581
あ、いい！はい。ということで、締めてください、ぼたんさん。
Ah, nice! Alright, please finish it off, Botan-san.

396
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:38,281
えー、チケットを当てるために徳を積んでおきたいのですが何をすればいいでしょう？
Um, 'I want to accumulate karma to win a ticket, what should I do?'

397
00:26:38,281 --> 00:26:42,581
これはもう、みんなの配信を見守ることです。おー！
This is definitely about watching everyone's streams. Oh!

398
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:48,081
ホロライブに徳を積む。そう、ホロライブに向けて徳を積んでいく。
Accumulate karma for Hololive. Yes, accumulate karma towards Hololive.

399
00:26:48,081 --> 00:26:52,581
ということでね、レギルス中尉さん。えー、トイレ掃除をし、親孝行をし便利
So, Regulus Lt., clean the toilet, be good to your parents,

400
00:26:52,581 --> 00:26:57,581
ホロライブの配信を見、そして自分を大切にすることで、
watch Hololive streams, and take care of yourself,

401
00:26:57,581 --> 00:27:02,581
チケットが当たりますように！当たりまーす！
and you will win a ticket! You'll win!

402
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:07,581
おー。大変だが、やることいっぱいだよ。当てるためにはこれ全部しないとやっぱり。
Oh. It's hard, there's a lot to do. You have to do all this to win.

403
00:27:07,581 --> 00:27:11,581
毎日、今日からみんなしなね。今日からだよ。毎日、毎日トイレ掃除すんのピッカピカや。
Everyone, do it starting today. From today. Clean the toilet every single day until it's sparkling.

404
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:15,581
ラミィさんいなくなっちゃんで。はい。ということで次の悩みはこちら！
Lamy-san's going to disappear. Yes. So, the next concern is this!

405
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:19,481
デデン！
Ta-da!

406
00:27:19,481 --> 00:27:23,581
はい。じゃあこちらは、ポル、誰が読むんだっけかな、じゃあねねさん行きましょうか。
Yes. Well for this one, Pol... who was reading it? Let's go with Nene-san.

407
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:26,581
はい。熱上げシートさん。熱上げるな上げるな。
Yes. Netsuage Sheet-san. Don't raise the heat, don't.

408
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:30,881
ねぽらぼの皆さんへ、はい。えー、初給料を何に使えばいいか迷っています。
To the NePoLaBo members. Yes. Um, 'I'm wondering what to use my first paycheck for.'

409
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:37,081
皆さんの初給料、何を買いましたか？
'What did you guys buy with your first paychecks?'

410
00:27:37,081 --> 00:27:42,581
あ、じゃあこれは、やっぱホロライブに、還元だね。はい。
Ah, so for this, it's about giving back to Hololive. Yes.

411
00:27:42,581 --> 00:27:46,381
初めてお給料もらった時みんな覚えてる？覚えてるよ。
Does everyone remember when you got your first paycheck? I do.

412
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:50,881
あったね。買いたいものあったもんね。私、覚えてる私。お、何買った？
I remember. I had something I wanted to buy. I remember. Oh, what did you buy?

413
00:27:50,881 --> 00:27:55,581
いいマイク買いました。あー！分かり、分かり、分かる！
I bought a good mic. Ah! I get it, I get it, I get it!

414
00:27:55,581 --> 00:28:00,081
声をきれいに伝えたいって。分かるー。機材ね、機材を買いました。
You wanted to convey your voice clearly. I get that. Equipment, I bought equipment.

415
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:04,081
機材だ。機材はね、それはある。じゃあちょっと機材以外でみんな行こうか。
Equipment. Equipment, for sure. Well then, let's go with something other than equipment.

416
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:08,581
じゃあ行く。機材以外？でもね、ラミィは初給料で、
I'll go then. Something other than equipment? Well, for Lamy, with my first paycheck,

417
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:14,581
あの、あ、でも二個あるな。何だろ、何だろ？
um, oh, but I have two things. What are they, what are they?

418
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:19,081
じゃあちょっとみんなが言いそうな方は置いといて、
Well, putting aside the one everyone else would probably say,

419
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:24,081
ラミィね、あの、家族にちょっといい、あの、物を買った。
Lamy, um, bought something nice for my family.

420
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:29,081
おー！これが親孝行。親孝行してますよ、ラミィさん。
Oh! That's filial piety. You're being filial, Lamy-san.

421
00:28:29,081 --> 00:28:34,081
はい。買いましたね、お屋敷に。いいな。はい。お父様に買いました。お父さんに！いいね！
Yes. I bought it for my mansion. That's nice. Yes. I bought it for my father. For your dad! Nice!

422
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:39,081
じゃあ、ポ、ポル、ポルサ行きましょうか。ポルカも機材だったんだよな。
Then, Pol, Pol... let's go with Polka. Polka also bought equipment.

423
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:42,581
あ、でもそうなるよね。そうなる。機材の中でもでも色々あるんじゃない？
Ah, well, that's how it goes. It is. But aren't there different kinds of equipment?

424
00:28:42,581 --> 00:28:47,581
あ、マイクじゃなくてインターフェースを変えました。あー、そっちね、なるほど。
Ah, instead of a mic, I changed the interface. Oh, that one, I see.

425
00:28:47,581 --> 00:28:54,081
やっぱ仕事道具やからな。もっといいの作りたいなって思った。あと「歌ってみた」とかに費やしましたね。
Because it's a tool for work. I wanted to make better things. And I spent it on cover songs too.

426
00:28:54,081 --> 00:29:00,081
おー、ありがとうございます。それはでも、あるね。はい。じゃあ最後ねねさん締めてください。
Oh, thank you. That's definitely something. Yes. Then, Nene-san, please finish it off.

427
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:07,581
え、ねね、買ったものとかママにちょっといいものも買ったし、
Um, Nene bought things, like something nice for my mom,

428
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:12,081
親孝行じゃん。でも印象的に残ってるのは、
That's filial piety. But what stays in my memory is,

429
00:29:12,081 --> 00:29:17,581
あの、ホロライブ入ってお給料もらってから神社に行った時、
when I went to a shrine after joining Hololive and getting paid,

430
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:22,581
五円じゃなくて、500倍ご縁が欲しいと思って500円。500円投げて。500円で。
I wanted 500 times the luck, so I offered 500 yen instead of 5. Throwing 500 yen. With 500 yen.

431
00:29:22,581 --> 00:29:27,581
え、これ、500倍期待されてんのかなー、みたいな。うん、500倍のご縁がありますようにって。
I was like, 'is a 500-fold return expected?'. Yeah, 'may I have 500 times the luck'.

432
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:32,581
ちょっと100倍ちゃう。うん、私もね、皆さんもね、ちょっとね、500倍。
Isn't it 100 times? Yeah, me and all of you, a bit, 500 times.

433
00:29:32,581 --> 00:29:38,081
もうどうすればいいの。神様も戸惑うよ。500倍って言ってるけど500円かー、みたいな。
What should I do? Even the god would be confused. Like, 'she says 500 times, but it's only 500 yen'.

434
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:43,081
ちょっと贅沢。ちょっと、ちょっとおバカさん。
A bit extravagant. A bit, a bit silly.

435
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:47,581
この子どうしよう。ごめんなさいね。でもね、あれだよね。ラミィさ、あれだよね。
What are we going to do with her? Sorry. But, you know. Lamy, you know,

436
00:29:47,581 --> 00:29:52,581
ねねと一緒にちょっとお買い物とか行ったよね。行ったよね、行ったよね。
you went shopping with Nene, didn't you? We did, we did.

437
00:29:52,581 --> 00:30:00,081
そういうのものとか買ったり。ちょっとね、お高いお揃いのバッグとか買って。
Buying things like that. We bought slightly expensive matching bags.

438
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,093
どう？
How was it?

439
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:02,093
何想像した？
What did you imagine?

440
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:04,593
いや、いつも下着の話してるんで、ポルカ。
Well, Polka always talks about underwear.

441
00:30:04,593 --> 00:30:06,093
君たちが下着の話してるんで。
You guys are the ones talking about underwear.

442
00:30:06,593 --> 00:30:08,093
いやいや違います違います。
No, no, that's not right.

443
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:10,593
じゃあ次は高級バッグとか買った？
So next, did you buy a luxury bag?

444
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:11,593
あ、バッグの方に行きますね。
Ah, moving on to bags then.

445
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:12,593
いやだー！
No way!

446
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:15,593
はい、ということで、じゃあねねさんに締めてもらいましょうか。
Alright, with that said, let's have Nene-san wrap this up.

447
00:30:16,093 --> 00:30:19,593
はい。えーっと、熱上げシートさん、
Yes. Um, Netsu-age Sheet-san,

448
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:23,593
初のお給料は、ねぽらぼのライブに、
for your first paycheck, for the Nepolabo concert...

449
00:30:24,093 --> 00:30:27,593
おー、チケット応募したり、あと、
Oh! How about applying for tickets, or...

450
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:30,593
みんなに会いに来て、えーっと、
coming to meet everyone, um...

451
00:30:31,093 --> 00:30:37,093
えーっと、えーっと、メンバーシップに入らないでしょうか！イエーイ！
um, um, how about joining our membership! Yay!

452
00:30:38,093 --> 00:30:39,593
販売促進！いいじゃん！
Sales promotion! Nice!

453
00:30:40,093 --> 00:30:43,093
ありがとうございます。ホロライブシティとかもね、やってますし。
Thank you very much. We've also got Hololive City and such.

454
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:46,593
ありがとうございます。サポートが有能。使えますよ。
Thank you very much. Competent support. We can use that.

455
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:50,593
ありがとうございます。素敵な初給料のね、使い道になりますように。
Thank you very much. I hope it becomes a wonderful use for your first paycheck.

456
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:53,093
熱上げシートさんが後悔しないように頑張るよ。
We'll do our best so Netsu-age Sheet-san won't have any regrets.

457
00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:56,593
はい、ということで、次のお悩みはこちら！
Alright, with that, here's the next concern!

458
00:30:58,593 --> 00:31:00,093
はい、これはじゃあ、ししろ、読みましょうか。
Alright, how about Shishiro reads this one?

459
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:02,593
長いなー。ポルポルでいいんじゃない？
That's long. Maybe Pol-Pol should do it?

460
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:05,093
じゃあ、読むよ。ポルポルで。
Alright, I'll read it. As Pol-Pol.

461
00:31:05,593 --> 00:31:10,593
はい。ファンネーム：雑炊はよいぞ。ガチ目の悩みだと。
Yes. Fan name: Zousui wa Yoizo. A serious concern.

462
00:31:10,593 --> 00:31:16,093
人の前で振舞い続けて、自分が何かわからなくなってしまったことです。
By continuing to behave a certain way in front of others, I've lost track of who I am.

463
00:31:16,593 --> 00:31:21,093
配信を見てる時の自分と日常で、他の人と接してる時の自分が、
The me watching the stream and the me in daily life interacting with others...

464
00:31:21,593 --> 00:31:24,093
違いすぎてなんかよく分かりません。
are so different that I don't really understand it.

465
00:31:24,093 --> 00:31:29,093
上手くはいっているんですが、なんとなくモヤモヤするので、ねぽらぼの皆さん助けてー。
Things are going well, but I feel somewhat uneasy, so everyone in Nepolabo, help me!

466
00:31:29,593 --> 00:31:31,093
これはガチですね。
This is serious.

467
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:36,593
でもね、ラミィは思うんだけど、こうやってみんなと一緒にいる時のラミィもラミィだし、
But you know, Lamy thinks that the Lamy when I'm here with everyone is Lamy,

468
00:31:37,093 --> 00:31:41,593
一人でスンッてなってる時のラミィもラミィだし、どれが本当とかじゃなくないかな？
and the Lamy when I'm all alone is also Lamy, so maybe it's not a matter of which one is 'real'?

469
00:31:42,593 --> 00:31:45,093
全部が自分みたい。全部が自分。
Everything is yourself. It's all you.

470
00:31:45,093 --> 00:31:48,093
全部が自分だと思うから、それはそれでいいのかもよ。
I think everything is yourself, so maybe that's fine as it is.

471
00:31:48,593 --> 00:31:50,093
え、どれか一個に、どれか一個に？
What, pick just one? Just one?

472
00:31:50,593 --> 00:31:53,593
え、でもだって、おまるんがさ、今のこのテンション24時間やってたら...
I mean, if Omaru-n were to maintain this level of energy for 24 hours straight...

473
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:58,093
こわれる！助けて！ねぽらぼのみんな助けてー！
I'd break! Help! Everyone in Nepolabo, help me!

474
00:31:58,093 --> 00:32:01,593
それこそ、おまるんも、この元気なまるもおまるんだし、
Exactly. Omaru-n, this energetic Maru is Omaru-n,

475
00:32:01,593 --> 00:32:04,593
ちょっと落ち着いてる時のおまるんもおまるんなわけじゃない。
and the slightly calmer Omaru-n is also Omaru-n, right?

476
00:32:05,093 --> 00:32:11,093
やっぱり、全部ひっくるめて、雑炊はよいぞさんなのではなかろうかと、ラミィは思うのですが。
After all, Lamy thinks that Zousui wa Yoizo-san is probably all of those versions combined.

477
00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:14,093
深いねー。皆様はどう思いますか？
That's deep. What do you all think?

478
00:32:15,593 --> 00:32:19,593
えー、どうしようかな。でも、なんとなくモヤモヤしてるらしいので、なるほどね。
Hmm, what to do. But since they seem to feel somewhat uneasy, I see.

479
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:24,093
ちょっとじゃあ、ザバッときってもらいましょうか、ししろに。いいよ。
Well, let's have Shishiro give a clean-cut answer. Okay.

480
00:32:24,593 --> 00:32:27,593
じゃあもう、これ。他の人と接してる時の自分が違いすぎて分かりません。
Well then, this: 'The me interacting with others is too different, I don't understand.'

481
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:30,593
ほら、でも無理に分かろうとしなくていいんじゃないでしょうか。
See, but maybe you don't need to force yourself to understand?

482
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:32,093
それっぽい！
That sounds like it!

483
00:32:32,593 --> 00:32:37,093
なので、だから、さっきのラミィちゃんの借りると、全部が自分なので、
So, borrowing from what Lamy-chan just said, since it's all you,

484
00:32:37,093 --> 00:32:41,093
なんか、そんな深く考えなくていいのかな。
maybe you don't have to think so deeply about it.

485
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:45,593
あ、さっきのおまるに近いんだけど、ぶっちゃけ、
Ah, it's close to what Omaru said earlier, but to be blunt,

486
00:32:45,593 --> 00:32:49,093
他の他人の人ってそこまで自分のことあんま深く考えてないから。
other people don't really think that deeply about you anyway.

487
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:53,093
正直なところ！なるほどね。
The honest truth! I see.

488
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:57,093
そこまで他人の人は自分のこと気にしてないから、逆に自分も気にしないっていうのは大事かな。
Since other people aren't that concerned about you, it might be important for you not to worry either.

489
00:32:57,593 --> 00:32:59,593
そうすればいいんじゃない。そう、雑炊。
You should just do that. Yes, Zousui.

490
00:33:00,093 --> 00:33:05,593
いいじゃん、雑炊。そうだよ、雑炊。雑炊食べて、まあ、細かいことはね。
Zousui, it's fine, Zousui. That's right, Zousui. Eat some porridge and, well, as for the small details...

491
00:33:06,093 --> 00:33:08,593
置いときましょう。気にしない。全部自分。
let's set them aside. Don't worry about it. It's all you.

492
00:33:09,593 --> 00:33:12,093
はい、ということで、じゃあ締めてもらいましょう、おまるんに。
Alright, with that, let's have Omaru-n wrap it up.

493
00:33:12,593 --> 00:33:18,093
はい！えー、雑炊はよいぞ。なんとなくモヤモヤすることがなくなるようにするには、
Yes! Um, Zousui wa Yoizo. To stop feeling somewhat uneasy,

494
00:33:18,593 --> 00:33:22,593
ポルカの「ペルソナ」というオリジナル曲を聴いてください。雑炊はよいぞー！
please listen to Polka's original song, 'Persona.' Zousui is great!

495
00:33:25,093 --> 00:33:26,093
雑炊じゃないのか！
It's not about the porridge?!

496
00:33:26,593 --> 00:33:29,093
はい、ということで、次のお悩みはこちら！
Alright, with that, here's the next concern!

497
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:34,593
はい、ペンタン皇帝。ペンタン皇帝さんですね。ペンタンコッテッタ、ちょっと可愛いですね。
Yes, Pentan Koutei. Pentan Koutei-san. Pentan-kottetta, that's a bit cute.

498
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:41,593
え、頑張らないといけないのに、体が動かない、頑張れないって時に頑張る方法が知りたいです。
'I want to know how to push through when I have to work hard, but my body won't move and I just can't.'

499
00:33:42,093 --> 00:33:44,093
頑張るな！頑張るな！
Don't push yourself! Don't push yourself!

500
00:33:44,593 --> 00:33:47,593
いや、頑張るな一択だな、これな。頑張るなよ。
No, 'don't push yourself' is the only choice here. Don't push yourself, okay?

501
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:52,593
そう、体が動かない時点で、もう無理してんだよ。無理だよ。もうSOS出してるよ、体が。
Yeah, if your body won't move, you're already overextending yourself. It's impossible. Your body is already sending out an SOS.

502
00:33:53,093 --> 00:33:56,593
休んで、休んで。休めよ。まあね、これね、頑張る方法が知りたいんだけど。
Rest, rest. Take a break. Well, yeah, they want to know how to push through, but...

503
00:33:58,593 --> 00:34:02,093
いや、でも頑張っちゃダメだと思うよ、その時は。飲み物。何かしらの。
No, but I think you shouldn't push yourself at a time like that. A drink. Some kind of...

504
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:04,593
え、それはエナジー系のやつ？
Oh, you mean like an energy drink?

505
00:34:05,593 --> 00:34:10,593
ただこれ、頑張らないといけないのにの、頑張らないといけない理由に寄る。
However, it depends on the reason why they 'have' to push through.

506
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:17,593
本当に、本当に頑張らないといけない時と、実はそこまで頑張らなくてもよかった時ってあるじゃん。
There are times when you really, truly have to, and then there are times when it turns out you didn't need to try that hard.

507
00:34:18,093 --> 00:34:22,593
真面目な方だとね、何もかも頑張らないとって思っちゃう。あるある。
Serious people tend to think they have to work hard at everything. It happens.

508
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:31,593
だから、まず本当にこれ今頑張らないといけない時なのかなって、まず考えるのが大事かなと、個人的には思うんですよ。
So, personally, I think it's important to first consider if this is truly a time when you must push yourself.

509
00:34:37,093 --> 00:34:42,093
確かに。そうだね。その物事のね、優先順位をつけて、
True. You're right. You have to prioritize things,

510
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:46,593
これが本当に大事なことなのか、今やらなければならないのかっていうのはね、大事だと思う。
and decide if this is truly important, or if it must be done right now. I think that's key.

511
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:51,093
とりあえず、でも、今日うち等からしたら、多分、もう休んでいいと思います。
For now, though, from our perspective, I think you can probably just rest for today.

512
00:34:51,093 --> 00:34:54,093
はい、そうだね。まあ、うち等としては、もう寝ろってことですね。
Yes, that's right. Well, as for us, it's 'just go to sleep.'

513
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,593
確かに。ということで、ペンタン皇帝さんの、お悩みが...
True. So, Pentan Koutei-san's concern is...

514
00:35:00,405 --> 00:35:01,405
ね。
Right?

515
00:35:01,405 --> 00:35:04,205
なんだろう、解決しますように。
I hope... it gets resolved.

516
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:05,205
しますように。
I hope so.

517
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:07,205
常に80%で生きていけ。
Always live your life at 80%.

518
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,605
までも大事よね、それね。
But that is important, isn't it?

519
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:09,605
休みは大事！
Rest is important!

520
00:35:09,605 --> 00:35:10,605
休め！寝ろ！
Rest! Sleep!

521
00:35:10,605 --> 00:35:12,605
休めー！
Rest!

522
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:16,205
元気なんだよなー。
They're so energetic.

523
00:35:16,205 --> 00:35:17,405
ということで。
And with that...

524
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:18,605
はい、次の。
Yes, the next...

525
00:35:18,605 --> 00:35:20,205
お悩みはこちら。
concern is this one.

526
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:21,405
ファンネーム：wadachi(本物)@あくあクルー
Fan Name: wadachi(Real)@AquaCrew

527
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:22,605
はい！
Yes!

528
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:25,205
ということで、じゃあ誰読もうか？ねねさんいきますか？
And so, who should read it? Nene-san, will you go?

529
00:35:25,205 --> 00:35:27,605
えー、ファンネーム、wadachi
Um, fan name, wadachi...

530
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:29,905
あくあクルーの方からいただきました。
...from an Aqua Crew member.

531
00:35:29,905 --> 00:35:31,605
あくあクルー？
Aqua Crew?

532
00:35:31,605 --> 00:35:34,205
あくあクルー？あくあクルー？
Aqua Crew? Aqua Crew?

533
00:35:34,205 --> 00:35:35,805
ねぽらぼのみなさん、こんばんはー！
Everyone in Nepolabo, good evening!

534
00:35:35,805 --> 00:35:38,305
あ、まねしてるー！こんばんは！
Oh, she's imitating her! Good evening!

535
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:40,005
ちゃんとしてる！リスペクトだよ！
I'm doing it properly! It's out of respect!

536
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:42,905
リア友がすごくストレスを抱えて悩んでいるのですが、
My real-life friend is suffering from a lot of stress and is troubled,

537
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:45,405
ねぽらぼのみなさんはどうやってストレスを発散していますか？
how do you members of Nepolabo relieve your stress?

538
00:35:45,405 --> 00:35:48,505
教えていただけると幸いです。
I would appreciate it if you could tell me.

539
00:35:48,505 --> 00:35:49,805
なるほど。
I see.

540
00:35:49,805 --> 00:35:52,405
じゃ、これはストレス発散方法。
Well then, stress relief methods.

541
00:35:52,405 --> 00:35:54,905
一人ずつ言っていこうか。ねね、ストレス。
Let's go around one by one. Nene, stress?

542
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:57,705
ねね、ストレス、え、暴飲暴食！
Nene, stress... uh, binge eating and drinking!

543
00:35:59,705 --> 00:36:01,405
体に良くない。
That's not good for the body.

544
00:36:01,405 --> 00:36:04,605
でも大事！たまに！たまにやるには。
But it's important! Occasionally! Doing it occasionally...

545
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:06,705
いいんじゃない？暴飲暴食。
...is fine, isn't it? Binge eating and drinking.

546
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:08,805
いいと思います。すごいスッキリします。
I think so. It's very refreshing.

547
00:36:08,805 --> 00:36:12,205
ポルカさんがなんか「そうじゃないんだよな」みたいな顔してたけど。
Polka-san had a look like, "That's not quite it."

548
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:14,405
「あ、違うな」みたいな顔があったけど。
She had a face like, "Oh, that's different."

549
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,905
ポルカさんはちなみに何なんですか？
What about you, Polka-san?

550
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:19,505
物欲解放！
Unleashing my material desires!

551
00:36:19,505 --> 00:36:21,305
一緒だよ！結局一緒じゃねえかよ！
That's the same! It's the same thing in the end!

552
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:24,505
なんでちょっと「違うな」みたいな顔してたんだよ。
Why did you make that "It's different" face then?

553
00:36:24,505 --> 00:36:26,205
ラミィは？ラミィは？
What about Lamy? Lamy?

554
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:29,005
ラミィはね、あの、さっきみんなで話してたけど、
For Lamy, well, we were all talking about this earlier, but...

555
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:31,905
あの、バカバカしい話をする。
...talking about ridiculous things.

556
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:34,705
友達いなかったらキツいよ。
That's tough if you don't have friends.

557
00:36:34,705 --> 00:36:38,305
普段から結構真面目なことをいろいろ考えて爆発しがちなので、
I tend to think about serious things all the time and almost explode,

558
00:36:38,305 --> 00:36:41,405
頭空っぽにして。
so emptying my head...

559
00:36:41,405 --> 00:36:43,705
あー、なるほどね。さっきもお友達としゃべってた。
Ah, I see. You were talking with your friends just now.

560
00:36:43,705 --> 00:36:47,405
会話の内容、言うな、言うな！
The content of that conversation... don't say it, don't say it!

561
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:51,905
みたいなのも、ストレス解消になるかなと思います。はい！
That kind of thing is also stress relief, I think. Yes!

562
00:36:51,905 --> 00:36:54,205
私のね、ストレス発散はね、寝る。
For me, my stress relief is sleeping.

563
00:36:54,205 --> 00:36:56,605
あー、大事！
Ah, that's important!

564
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:59,905
次の日になってたら結構忘れてるときあるから。
By the next day, there are times when I've mostly forgotten about it.

565
00:36:59,905 --> 00:37:03,305
忘れる！大事！寝るは大事！時間は大事だと思うよ。
You forget! It's important! Sleeping is important! Time is key, I think.

566
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:08,205
寝不足なときもさ、思考回路がフワフワして、変なこと考えちゃったりとかもするもんね。
When you're sleep-deprived, your thought process gets fuzzy and you think weird things, right?

567
00:37:08,205 --> 00:37:11,905
そうそう。考えすぎちゃうんだよね。ぐっすり寝る。
Exactly. You overthink things. Sleep soundly.

568
00:37:11,905 --> 00:37:15,405
なんか今日「寝る」多い、解決方法。
There's a lot of "sleeping" today as a solution.

569
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:20,405
寝るって大事なんだな。今日、ねぽらぼ解決するよ、寝れば！
Sleeping is important. Today, Nepolabo will solve everything... if you just sleep!

570
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,205
ということで、じゃあ、ねねさんまとめてください。
So, Nene-san, please summarize.

571
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:27,205
えーっと、wadachiさんは今日からストレスが溜まったら、
Um, wadachi-san, from today, if you feel stressed,

572
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:30,905
暴飲暴食をして、物欲をすべて解放して、
binge eat and drink, unleash all your material desires,

573
00:37:30,905 --> 00:37:35,005
寝ながら、内容ゼロの話をしてください。頑張ろうねー！
and while sleeping, talk about absolutely nothing. Do your best!

574
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:38,305
やばい人だよそれ！できますように！
That's a crazy person! Hope you can do it!

575
00:37:38,305 --> 00:37:40,605
はい！ということでね、次のお悩みはこちら！
Yes! And so, the next concern is this one!

576
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:48,505
ちょっとした悩みなのですが、怒りが込み上げてきた際に落ち着かせる方法は何かありますか？
This is just a small concern, but what are some ways to calm down when anger starts welling up?

577
00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:51,605
じゃ、おまるさん読んでください。あ、ししろ推しだ！
Then, Omaru-san, please read it. Oh, it's a Shishiro fan!

578
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:56,205
じゃ、ぼたんが読もう。シキシキ、ししろ大好きなSSRBさん。はい！
Then Botan should read it. Shiki-shiki, Shishiro-loving SSRB-san. Yes!

579
00:37:56,205 --> 00:38:00,705
ちょっとした悩みなのですが、怒りが込み上げてきた際に落ち着かせる方法は何がありますか？
This is just a small concern, but what are some ways to calm down when anger starts welling up?

580
00:38:00,705 --> 00:38:04,205
俺の右手がうずくぜー！動いてる！
My right hand is throbbing! It's moving!

581
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:06,605
はい、ねねさん。
Yes, Nene-san.

582
00:38:06,605 --> 00:38:09,405
え、使い古してボロボロになったタオルを切り刻む！
Uh, shredding up an old, worn-out towel!

583
00:38:09,405 --> 00:38:13,605
ちょっとガチ。闇深い。やめろやめろ。
That's a bit too real. It's dark. Stop it, stop it.

584
00:38:13,605 --> 00:38:18,205
ねね、なんかもう使わない割れかけの食器とかも割りそうじゃない？
Nene seems like she'd break cracked dishes she doesn't use anymore, doesn't she?

585
00:38:18,205 --> 00:38:22,405
あ、でも、あるからね、そういう施設ね。
Ah, but those kinds of facilities do exist.

586
00:38:22,405 --> 00:38:25,905
ゴミになってしまった食器を割る場所があるんですよ。
There are places where you can break dishes that have become trash.

587
00:38:25,905 --> 00:38:29,005
おもしろそうな場所あるじゃん。人気すぎて予約取れないんだって。
That sounds like an interesting place. Apparently, it's so popular you can't get a reservation.

588
00:38:29,005 --> 00:38:33,505
シキシキの子、ねねさんちょっと溜まってますよ！シキシキのことを思い出して！
Shiki-shiki-kun, Nene-san is a bit pent up! Remember Shiki-shiki!

589
00:38:33,505 --> 00:38:37,905
ということで、ねねちゃん、後でお悩み聞くわ。
So, Nene-chan, I'll listen to your troubles later.

590
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:41,305
後で暴飲暴食しようね。バカ話しようね。
Let's binge eat and drink later. Let's talk about stupid things.

591
00:38:41,305 --> 00:38:43,205
で、なんだっけ？怒り！
And, what was it? Anger!

592
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:45,705
え、でも、ラミィがあんまり怒り...
Well, but Lamy doesn't really feel anger...

593
00:38:45,705 --> 00:38:48,205
確かにラミィ怒ってないな。
It's true, Lamy doesn't get angry.

594
00:38:48,205 --> 00:38:51,405
わかんない、ごめん、わかんないかも。
I don't know, sorry, I might not know.

595
00:38:51,405 --> 00:38:53,005
じゃ、怒りが沸かない方法は？逆に。
Then, how about a way to not get angry? On the contrary.

596
00:38:53,005 --> 00:38:55,605
心を広く持つ。
Having a broad mind.

597
00:38:55,605 --> 00:38:57,705
同じ同じ。ポルカも怒んないから、心を広く持つしかないと思う。
Same here. Polka doesn't get angry either, so I think you just have to have a broad mind.

598
00:38:57,705 --> 00:39:02,205
その「広く持つ」って具体的にどうしたらいいんですか？
How exactly do you go about "having a broad mind"?

599
00:39:02,205 --> 00:39:05,205
別に、ちっぽけなことですから。宇宙とか銀河系規模で見たら。
Well, it's just a trivial matter. If you look at it on the scale of the universe or the galaxy...

600
00:39:05,205 --> 00:39:08,605
おまるんっていつも銀河規模で見てたん？宇宙の規模から？
Omarun, were you always looking at things on a galactic scale? From a cosmic perspective?

601
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:12,205
違うよ、自分のことは「ああやっちゃったな」とか...
No, for my own things I just think "Oh, I messed up again"...

602
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:01,317
...と思うけど、人のことはさ、ねえ。
...but when it comes to others, you know...

603
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:03,317
だって何回やってもあなただって、あなたもお母さんのお腹から生まれて...
Because, no matter what you do, you too, you were born from your mother's womb...

604
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,217
この地球上に降り立って、その銀河系の中の一人の生命なん...
and landed on this Earth, you're one life in that galaxy...

605
00:40:05,217 --> 00:40:06,717
あ、ちょっと、はい。
Ah, just a moment, yes.

606
00:40:06,717 --> 00:40:08,317
止めてもらっていいですか。
Could you stop there for a second?

607
00:40:08,317 --> 00:40:10,617
宇宙フェネックだったってことで。
So she was a space Fennec.

608
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,817
まあ、全てのものは原子からできてるって言いますから。
Well, they say everything is made of atoms.

609
00:40:12,817 --> 00:40:15,117
そうなん、なんか、ちょっと広すぎてよく分からんな。
Is that so? It's kind of too broad, I don't really get it.

610
00:40:15,117 --> 00:40:17,417
どうやってまとめろって言うんだ。
How am I supposed to wrap this up?

611
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:19,617
なんか、今日このディベートみたいな場がめっちゃ楽しくてさ。
I'm really enjoying this debate-like atmosphere today.

612
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,517
いや、獅白が、ディベートっていうか自分勝手な内容。
No, Shishiro... it's not a debate, it's just self-centered content.

613
00:40:22,517 --> 00:40:24,517
すべて、すべては原子からできています。なので、
Every... everything is made of atoms. So,

614
00:40:24,517 --> 00:40:28,317
なんか、怒りが込み上げてきた時は「みんな俺たちは原子なんだな」と思ってもらえればいいかなと思ってます。
whenever anger wells up, just think "we're all just atoms," and you'll be fine.

615
00:40:28,317 --> 00:40:29,717
強すぎ。
That's too strong.

616
00:40:29,717 --> 00:40:32,517
はい。ほぼ水分。俺たちほぼ水分。
Yes. Almost water. We're almost all water.

617
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:35,117
えー、ということでね。解決するように、お願いして...
Anyway, please wish for a resolution...

618
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:36,617
お願い。
Wish.

619
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:38,317
解決しますように！
May it be resolved!

620
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:40,917
ありがとうございましたー！
Thank you very much!

621
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:44,317
はい、ということで次が最後のお悩みになります。
Alright, so the next one will be the last concern.

622
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,717
こちら！
This one!

623
00:40:45,717 --> 00:40:47,517
なんだ、なんだ。
What is it, what is it?

624
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:50,217
お、雪民さんだ。雪民さんだ。
Oh, it's a Yukimin. It's a Yukimin.

625
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:54,117
「ただの一杯雪民Kさん。7月7日雨になりそう！！！やだ！！！
From "Just a Glass of Yukimin K-san." "It looks like it's going to rain on July 7th!!! No way!!!

626
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:57,517
晴れにして！！！織姫と彦星会わせてあげて！！！」
Make it sunny!!! Let Orihime and Hikoboshi meet!!!"

627
00:40:57,517 --> 00:40:59,417
マジで？早くね？その天気予報。
Seriously? Isn't that a bit early? That weather forecast.

628
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:02,617
なんでそんな先の天気予報出てるん。
Why is there a weather forecast for that far ahead?

629
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:05,217
でもさ、七夕の日ってかなりの確率で曇りとか雨じゃない？
But, isn't there a high chance of clouds or rain on Tanabata?

630
00:41:05,217 --> 00:41:07,517
確かに。統計学が出てるんじゃね？
True. Maybe it's based on statistics?

631
00:41:07,517 --> 00:41:10,617
ちょっと待って。まず、読み終わってないから読んでいい？
Wait a minute. I haven't finished reading, so can I read?

632
00:41:10,617 --> 00:41:15,417
「ということで、やだ！晴れにして！織姫と彦星様を合わせてあげて」ということで。
So, 'No way! Make it sunny! Let Orihime and Hikoboshi meet' is what it says.

633
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:17,417
やだやだ、俺たちが合わせる。
No way, we'll let them meet.

634
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:20,017
そうだね、うちらがね、このねぽらぼパワーで晴れにします。
That's right, we'll make it sunny with our Nepolabo power.

635
00:41:20,017 --> 00:41:21,917
え、今誰言ったの？俺たちが合わせるって。

00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,517
あいつめちゃ雨女なんだよ。あいつ雨女なんだよ。
She's a huge rain woman. She's a rain woman.

640
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:31,317
え、じゃあ私いないほうがいい？
Eh, then should I not be here?

641
00:41:31,317 --> 00:41:34,117
大丈夫！大丈夫！雨女とかそういうわけじゃないんだよ。
It's okay! It's okay! It's not like you're a rain woman.

ラミィが晴れにするから大丈夫ですよ。

If Orihime is Nepolabo, and Hikoboshi is...

650
00:41:57,117 --> 00:42:00,617
ライブに来る人とか、見てくれる人のことを言ってるんじゃない？
Maybe it's talking about the people coming to the live, or the people watching?

651
00:42:00,617 --> 00:42:04,317
織姫様もおるから。彦星おるし。

00:49:49,729 --> 00:49:54,629
新しいバッグが欲しいなあと思っているそこのあなた！
so for those who want a new bag!

772
00:49:54,729 --> 00:49:56,629
結構、物入りそうだった。大きかったよね、めっちゃね。
It holds a lot. It was really big, wasn't it?

773
00:49:56,729 --> 00:49:59,329
はい、この機会をお見逃しなく！
Yes, don't miss this opportunity!

774
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:01,441
そして...
And...

775
00:50:01,441 --> 00:50:02,271
モチーフチャーム！
the motif charm!

776
00:50:02,271 --> 00:50:03,341
モチーフチャーム！
Motif charm!

777
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:04,241
モチーフチャーム！
Motif charm!

778
00:50:04,241 --> 00:50:05,581
アッ、ちょっとこれ聞いてください！
Ah, wait, listen to this!

779
00:50:05,581 --> 00:50:07,681
リハーサルの時は「モチーフチャーフ」って言ったのに、
During rehearsal, I called it a "motif chaff,"

780
00:50:07,681 --> 00:50:10,191
本番「モチーフチャーム」って言えたからね！はい！
but I managed to say "motif charm" for real! Yes!

781
00:50:10,191 --> 00:50:11,971
言えない...
She couldn't say it...

782
00:50:11,971 --> 00:50:14,501
モチーフチャーム！
Motif charm!

783
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:17,501
はい。えーこの画像だとちょっとわかりづらいと思うんですけど、
Yes. It might be a bit hard to see in this image,

784
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:21,191
ガラス風になっていてすごくおしゃれな感じとなっております。
but it has a glass-like finish and looks very stylish.

785
00:50:21,191 --> 00:50:24,301
透けててね、めちゃめちゃ綺麗だったんですよ。
It's translucent, and it was really beautiful.

786
00:50:24,301 --> 00:50:27,641
これね、1個ずつ外して付けることもできるのでね、
You can also detach them and use them individually.

787
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:31,271
あのさりげなく、こうスマホだったり、このトートバッグだったり、巾着だったりね。
Like, subtly putting it on your phone, tote bag, or drawstring bag.

788
00:50:31,271 --> 00:50:33,341
そう、これ1個1個分けられるからなんか賑やかな感じ、
Yeah, since they can be separated, you can make it lively,

789
00:50:33,341 --> 00:50:35,481
「自分はこの並び順にしたい」みたいな。
or say "I want them in this specific order."

790
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:37,501
ねー、いろいろできる。
Right, you can do all sorts of things.

791
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:41,381
いろいろできるような感じになっておりますので、いろんなとこに付けてみてください！
It's designed to be versatile, so please try attaching it to various things!

792
00:50:41,381 --> 00:50:42,641
はーい！
Okay!

793
00:50:42,641 --> 00:50:44,381
そして、はい、じゃあ私読みまーす！
And, alright, I'll read the next one!

794
00:50:44,381 --> 00:50:47,471
タペストリーとアクリルスタンドです！ドン！
The tapestry and acrylic stands! Boom!

795
00:50:47,471 --> 00:50:51,481
おー！これはね、ライブのイラストを使ったグッズとなっております！
Oh! These items use illustrations from the live performance!

796
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,141
おー！
Ooh!

797
00:50:53,141 --> 00:50:56,581
タペストリーはですね、発色が良くて、もうすごくおすすめです！
The tapestry has great color quality, so I highly recommend it!

798
00:50:56,581 --> 00:50:57,541
すごいきれいだった！
It was so beautiful!

799
00:50:57,541 --> 00:51:03,251
ね。で、アクリルスタンドは全員分集めると大きなジオラマになりますので、
Right. And if you collect all four acrylic stands, they become a large diorama.

800
00:51:03,251 --> 00:51:05,611
ぜひ、あの4つ集めて並べて飾ってください！
So please collect all four and display them together!

801
00:51:05,611 --> 00:51:07,611
これ立体的なんだよね、アクリル。
These acrylics are layered, right?

802
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:10,141
背景とね、スタンドとがね。そう。
With the background and the stand. Yeah.

803
00:51:10,141 --> 00:51:13,251
結構立体的になってるんで、4人で並べるとすご迫力がすごかった。
They're quite 3D, and seeing all four together was really impressive.

804
00:51:13,251 --> 00:51:14,611
よかった。
It was great.

805
00:51:14,611 --> 00:51:16,541
奥行きがあったよねー。
They had real depth.

806
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:19,541
そこにね、ポラボがいるみたいな感じだったね。おるよ！
It felt like NePoLaBo was right there. We are!

807
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:21,641
で、今回ね...
And this time...

808
00:51:21,641 --> 00:51:25,241
この盛りだくさんのライブのグッズの紹介になるんですけども、
this is a lot of merch for the live event we're introducing,

809
00:51:25,241 --> 00:51:27,611
今日の21時から、
starting today at 21:00,

810
00:51:27,611 --> 00:51:32,541
ホロライブオフィシャルショップで販売するので、要チェックしてください！
they'll be on sale at the Hololive Official Shop, so check it out!

811
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:36,241
皆、ここからね、ちょっと注意事項があるから...
Everyone, there are some cautionary points from here on...

812
00:51:36,241 --> 00:51:41,581
ちょっと、難しいからね、よくぼたんちゃんのお話を聞いてください！
It's a bit complicated, so please listen carefully to what Botan has to say!

813
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:43,141
まず1つ目！
First point!

814
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,341
うるさくしないでください。
Please don't be noisy.

815
00:51:44,341 --> 00:51:48,441
えーと、先行発送グッズと受注販売グッズを一緒に紹介したんですけども、
We introduced priority shipping items and made-to-order items together,

816
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:54,141
こちら両方一緒に買うと、受注販売グッズが届く日に届いてしまうため、
but if you buy both together, they'll all arrive when the made-to-order items are ready.

817
00:51:54,141 --> 00:51:58,251
ライブ前に届かないという、ちょっと注意事項です。
Which means they might not arrive before the live. That's the warning.

818
00:51:58,251 --> 00:52:00,441
そうなんです。難しいです。
That's right. It's tricky.

819
00:52:00,441 --> 00:52:06,251
なので、えーと、同一会計で先行発送グッズと受注販売グッズを一緒に買わないように、
So, to avoid that, please don't buy priority items and made-to-order items in the same transaction.

820
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:11,611
先行発送グッズが欲しい方、ライブ前にグッズが欲しいという方は、
Those who want the priority items and want them before the live...

821
00:52:11,611 --> 00:52:14,441
別に買って頂けたら嬉しいです！
We'd appreciate it if you bought them separately!

822
00:52:14,441 --> 00:52:16,281
お会計を別にすれば大丈夫！
It's fine if you do separate transactions!

823
00:52:16,281 --> 00:52:20,641
会計分けて頂ければ大丈夫なんですけども、同時に受注分と先行分を買ってしまうと、
Separate checkouts are fine, but if you buy made-to-order and priority items at once,

824
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:24,611
受注分に合わせて発送されてしまいますので、
they'll all be shipped according to the made-to-order schedule.

825
00:52:24,611 --> 00:52:29,441
どっちも欲しいけど先行が先に欲しい方は、分けてお会計してください！
If you want both but want the priority items first, please check out separately!

826
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:35,481
ま、要はね、ライブに向けて欲しい方は、先行だけまずお買い物して、
Basically, if you want them for the live, just buy the priority items first,

827
00:52:35,481 --> 00:52:39,251
で、その後受注を買えば大丈夫ってことですね！
and then you can buy the made-to-order ones after! That's it!

828
00:52:39,251 --> 00:52:43,341
よくわかります。ここだけちょっと注意して頂けたら嬉しいです。
Understood. Please just be careful about this part.

829
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:47,611
はい。そして2つ目！先行発送グッズなんですけど、残念ながら数に限りがございます。
Okay. And second! Priority items unfortunately have a limited quantity.

830
00:52:47,611 --> 00:52:54,141
在庫がなくなり次第、販売終了になってしまいますのでご注意ください！
Please note that sales will end once stock runs out!

831
00:52:54,141 --> 00:52:58,471
でもね、急ぎすぎて、その受注と先行を一緒にね！
But don't rush so much that you bundle made-to-order and priority items!

832
00:52:58,471 --> 00:53:00,251
そうなんだよねー！
Exactly!

833
00:53:00,251 --> 00:53:03,251
届かなくなるのでね、お気をつけください。
They won't arrive in time, so please be careful.

834
00:53:03,251 --> 00:53:05,611
まずはね、先行を。
Priority items first.

835
00:53:05,611 --> 00:53:11,141
そうだね、先行商品で欲しいものがあれば、それをお先に買うっていうことがおすすめです！
Right, if there's something you want from the priority list, we recommend buying that first!

836
00:53:11,141 --> 00:53:16,281
で、詳しくはですね、この後公開される特設ページで注意事項も、ありますので。
For more details, there are also precautions on the special page to be released after this.

837
00:53:16,281 --> 00:53:19,481
あの、ちょっとしっかり読んでから申し込んで頂ければ嬉しいです！
Please read them carefully before you make your purchase!

838
00:53:19,481 --> 00:53:22,141
要チェック！
Check it out!

839
00:53:22,141 --> 00:53:25,241
獅白さん、分かりやすい説明ありがとう！
Botan, thanks for the clear explanation!

840
00:53:25,241 --> 00:53:29,471
はーい！はい。ライブ7月7日から始まるホロライブシティのツアー企画！
Alright! Now, for the Hololive City tour starting July 7th!

841
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:32,611
なーにー？！
Whaaaaat?!

842
00:53:32,611 --> 00:53:40,141
「Twinkle 4 You」の開催に合わせた、ツアープラン、ねぽらぼプランが提供されることになりました！
To coincide with "Twinkle 4 You," a tour plan, the NePoLaBo plan, will be offered!

843
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:43,141
やったー！
Yay!

844
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:46,471
提供されることになりました。なりましたー！
It will be offered. It will!

845
00:53:46,471 --> 00:53:49,611
対象期間中にこのプランに参加すると、
If you participate in this plan during the period,

846
00:53:49,611 --> 00:53:54,541
ねねたち、ねぽらぼからのメッセージボイスとかが付いてくるらしいので、
it seems it'll come with message voices from NePoLaBo, including me!

847
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:57,251
楽しみにしててください！
So please look forward to it!

848
00:53:57,251 --> 00:54:01,471
ノベルティ付きワンデーパスとかも...
There's also a novelty-included One Day Pass...

849
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:05,251
これワンデーパスがあったら、乗り物乗り放題になるね！
With a One Day Pass, you get unlimited rides!

850
00:54:05,251 --> 00:54:06,681
あ、なるほど。ランドの方のってこと？
Ah, I see. Like at "the Land"?

851
00:54:06,681 --> 00:54:10,141
ランドって... 語弊がある、語弊がある。
"The Land"? That's misleading, that's misleading.

852
00:54:10,141 --> 00:54:15,141
東京ドームシティの乗り物ってことね！
You mean the rides at Tokyo Dome City!

853
00:54:15,141 --> 00:54:18,541
ビッグ・オー乗って欲しい。ビッグ・オー、5回くらい乗って欲しい。
I want you to ride the Big O. Like five times.

854
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:21,341
あのジェットコースターは、結構怖い。
That roller coaster is pretty scary.

855
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,341
ジェットコースターじゃない、観覧車だよ。
It's not a roller coaster, it's a Ferris wheel.

856
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:27,441
ジェットコースターも怖いよね。そう、サンダードルフィンのやつ、めっちゃ怖くて面白い。
The roller coaster is scary too. Yeah, the Thunder Dolphin one is terrifying and fun.

857
00:54:27,441 --> 00:54:31,611
詳細はですね、明日5月1日からホロライブシティの公式サイトで公開になります。
Details will be available on the Hololive City official site starting tomorrow, May 1st.

858
00:54:31,611 --> 00:54:37,501
楽しみー！
Can't wait!

859
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:41,641
いや、今回ライブに向けてね、本当にたくさんの準備、みんなしてる。
Man, everyone's doing so much preparation for this live.

860
00:54:41,641 --> 00:54:45,471
してるしてる！
We are, we are!

861
00:54:45,471 --> 00:54:48,471
レッスンも頑張ってるんで、それ、ここでアピールしとかなかった？
We're working hard on lessons too, shouldn't we mention that here?

862
00:54:48,471 --> 00:54:51,241
急になに？！
So sudden?!

863
00:54:51,241 --> 00:54:55,471
実はずっと今日座ってて、ちょけてないっす。なんかねぽらぼってちょけるもんかなと思って。
Actually, we've just been sitting here today, not goofing off at all. I thought NePoLaBo was all about goofing off.

864
00:54:55,471 --> 00:55:00,141
ちょけたいの？
You want to goof off?

865
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:02,153
うっかり漏れながら、なんか、言っちゃいけない...
Carelessly leaking things you shouldn't say...

866
00:55:02,153 --> 00:55:04,653
...そんなこともみんな、やっぱ言っちゃうことがあるから。
...everyone ends up saying those kinds of things.

867
00:55:04,953 --> 00:55:05,653
どういうこと！？
What do you mean by that!?

868
00:55:05,853 --> 00:55:08,653
ここは台本を読みながら、それでも...
We'll read from the script, but even so...

869
00:55:08,753 --> 00:55:10,653
...全力告知をしましょう！
...let's do our best with these promotions!

870
00:55:10,653 --> 00:55:13,653
こんなコーナーを用意しました！ 題して...
I've prepared a corner! It's called...

871
00:55:13,753 --> 00:55:16,953
「全力告知！ ねぽらぼは前進アピール！」
"Full Force Promotion! NePoLaBo's Full Body Appeal!"

872
00:55:17,153 --> 00:55:20,153
イェーイ！
Yay!

873
00:55:20,653 --> 00:55:23,153
チョゲディイイカン！ チョゲディイイカン！
Feeling good! Feeling good!

874
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:26,653
はい、ということで、こちらはライブに向けて...
Okay, so this is for the live show...

875
00:55:26,753 --> 00:55:29,653
...元気が有り余っていらっしゃるねぽらぼのために...
...for the members of NePoLaBo who have too much energy...

876
00:55:29,653 --> 00:55:31,653
待って待って、元気でしょう！
Wait, wait, we're definitely energetic!

877
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,653
一人10秒でライブのアピールを...
Each person will have 10 seconds to promote the live...

878
00:55:33,753 --> 00:55:36,153
...全身全力でやってもらいます！
...using their whole body and giving it their all!

879
00:55:36,353 --> 00:55:37,653
なるほどー！
I see!

880
00:55:37,953 --> 00:55:39,653
はい、じゃあやりたい人はどうぞ！
Alright, whoever wants to go first, go ahead!

881
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,653
はい！ はい！ じゃあ、ねねからいきましょう！
Me! Me! Okay, let's start with Nene!

882
00:55:41,953 --> 00:55:43,153
はい！ よし！
Okay! Alright!

883
00:55:43,353 --> 00:55:45,153
カウント出るから、10秒以内に...
The countdown will appear, so within 10 seconds...

884
00:55:45,253 --> 00:55:47,653
...アピール頑張ってください！ それでは、どうぞ！
...do your best to promote it! Ready, go!

885
00:55:48,153 --> 00:55:50,653
え、なんと、今回のライブのために...
Wait, for this live show...

886
00:55:50,753 --> 00:55:53,153
...書き下ろされた！
...a newly written!

887
00:55:53,253 --> 00:55:55,653
新曲が！
New song!

888
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:57,653
浴衣が心配！ 映さないようにしてくれてる！
I'm worried about her yukata! They're trying not to show it!

889
00:55:57,753 --> 00:55:59,153
あるかもー！
Might be there!

890
00:55:59,153 --> 00:56:00,653
おーい！ 終了ー！
Hey! Time's up!

891
00:56:00,753 --> 00:56:05,653
さよならー！ はい、お疲れ様でした！
Bye-bye! Okay, good job!

892
00:56:06,153 --> 00:56:08,653
みんな伝わった？ どこ目線やねん。
Did it reach everyone? What's with that perspective?

893
00:56:08,753 --> 00:56:10,653
みんな伝わったかなー？
I wonder if it reached everyone?

894
00:56:10,653 --> 00:56:12,653
伝わったよー。なんか動くのうるさかったけど。
It reached us. Though your movements were a bit noisy.

895
00:56:13,153 --> 00:56:15,653
でも、そういうコーナーでしょ？
But that's what this corner is for, right?

896
00:56:16,153 --> 00:56:18,653
ねぽらぼ新曲、あるのかな？ あるかもー。
Will there be a new NePoLaBo song? Maybe.

897
00:56:19,153 --> 00:56:21,653
「あるかも」だから！ 「あるかも」だから！
She said "maybe"! It's just a "maybe"!

898
00:56:22,153 --> 00:56:24,653
待って、なんでそんな一人の空間みたいに...
Wait, why are you acting like you're in your own world...

899
00:56:26,653 --> 00:56:29,653
次誰？ 次誰？
Who's next? Who's next?

900
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:32,653
じゃあ、次元気に出していこう！ はい、どうぞ！
Okay, let's keep that energy going! Next!

901
00:56:33,653 --> 00:56:36,653
元気なスイッチ入れて、ポチポチポチ...
Turn on the energy switch, click-click-click...

902
00:56:37,153 --> 00:56:40,653
よし、入れてもらいましたので、ポルカがいきます！
Alright, it's on, so Polka is going!

903
00:56:41,153 --> 00:56:44,653
誰か言って。行くよ、せーの、カン！
Someone say it. Here I go, ready, go!

904
00:56:45,653 --> 00:56:48,653
今回のライブのためだけの新しい衣装が...
