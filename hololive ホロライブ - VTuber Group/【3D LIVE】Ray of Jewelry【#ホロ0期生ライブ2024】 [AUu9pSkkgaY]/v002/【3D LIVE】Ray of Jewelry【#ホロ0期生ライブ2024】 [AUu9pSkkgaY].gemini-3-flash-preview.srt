あれから7年たったよ。1人で立っていたステージも 今はたくさんの仲間でいっぱい！
7 years have passed since then. The stage I once stood on alone is now full of so many friends!

5
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,500
諦めずに歩いていてよかったね。 わたしは今幸せだよ。 SORA
I'm glad I didn't give up and kept walking. I'm happy now. SORA

Let's keep updating and go see many different worlds together♡ Roboco

8
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
デッカくなるぞ！！って意気込んで、たくさん頑張ったよね。
"I'll get big!!" With that spirit, you worked so hard.

9
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
今、本当にデッカくなれてるよ！！ 自分の思うまま突き進んでね☆ Suisei
Now, you've really become big!! Keep pushing forward as you see fit☆ Suisei

10
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
自信もないのに夢だけはずっとはなさなかったよね。
Even though you lacked confidence, you never let go of your dreams.

11
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
今たくさんの夢が咲いているよ！ 1人じゃない、みんなといっしょに。 さくらみこ
Now many dreams are blooming! You're not alone, we're all together. Sakura Miko

12
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,500
「ありえない」の向こう側へ！ 終わるはずだった世界から
Beyond the "impossible"! From a world that was supposed to end,

13
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,500
AZKiは今もまだこの世界でたくさんの仲間と一緒にいるよ！ 自分が決めた道を行け！ AZKi
AZKi is still in this world with many friends! Go down the path you've chosen! AZKi

14
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:55,166
行くよ！
Here we go!

15
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Dream Story

16
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:12,788
ふと忘れてしまいたくなる
I feel like I might accidentally forget

17
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:15,908
昨日のあの記憶のピースね
Those pieces of yesterday's memories

18
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,458
失くしたりはできそうもないけど
It doesn't seem like I can lose them

19
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:23,108
うまく繋げばまた続きへ
But if I connect them well, they'll lead to what's next

20
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:26,758
でも今は関係ないんだよ
But that doesn't matter right now

21
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:30,208
そんなことも忘れちゃおよな
Let's just forget about all that

22
00:05:30,558 --> 00:05:33,858
不思議な世界にアクセル全開で
With the accelerator floored into a mysterious world

23
00:05:34,008 --> 00:05:37,158
飛び込もうよ一緒に
Let's dive in together

24
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:41,258
でもでも急ぎっぱなしは禁物で
But but, rushing all the time is a no-no

25
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:44,408
急がば回ってるっていうくらいじゃ
Better safe than sorry, as they say

26
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:47,858
だからたまにはゆっくりひと休み
So let's take a slow break once in a while

27
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:51,358
したらそれじゃそよ風のリズムで
And then go with the rhythm of the breeze

28
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:53,308
止まらねぇぞ！
We won't stop!

29
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,758
飛んでけハイ！大きく息を吸ったら
Fly away, high! Take a deep breath

30
00:05:56,858 --> 00:06:00,158
僕らのストーリーが今溢れ出すよ
And our story starts overflowing now

31
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:01,858
もっともっと大きくね
Bigger and bigger

32
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,658
最初が肝心なんです！
The beginning is crucial!

33
00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:05,808
はじめまして、こんにちは！せーの
Nice to meet you, hello! One, two...

34
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:07,458
ホロライブだよ！
It's Hololive!

35
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:10,958
もう一度ハイ！そら遠くまで届け
Once more, high! Reach out far into the sky

36
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:14,408
ドキドキまで奇想天外に彩っていく Dream☆Story
Unexpectedly, even to the heartbeat, painting our Dream☆Story

37
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:18,158
やっぱ一秒たりとも目を離さないで欲しいな
As expected, I don't want you to look away for even a second

38
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:21,058
まばたきもしてらんない
Can't even blink

39
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,408
ああ ほらね 最高でしょ？ イェイ！
Ah, see? It's the best, right? Yay!

40
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:43,158
一歩進めばまた後ろへ
Step forward, then back again

41
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:46,458
見えない力が邪魔している
An invisible force is getting in the way

42
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:49,958
ジャンプしたりできたらいいけれど
It'd be nice if I could jump over it

43
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:53,508
それも愛嬌　どうぞよろしく
But that's just part of the charm, so please bear with me

44
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:57,108
でも今は関係ないんだよ
But that doesn't matter right now

45
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,658
心響くリズムを辿れば
If we follow the rhythm that resonates in our hearts

46
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:04,208
不思議な世界の続きのページで
On the next page of this mysterious world

47
00:07:04,308 --> 00:07:07,458
また出会えたね Destiny
We've met again, it's destiny

48
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:11,208
もしもし遅めのテンポもいいけど
Hello, a slow tempo is fine too

49
00:07:11,308 --> 00:07:14,658
今はそんな場合じゃないわけじゃない？
But isn't right now not the time for that?

50
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:18,108
だけど大丈夫、一息ついたのならさ
But it's okay, if you've caught your breath

51
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,508
いちにのさんの合図で
On the count of three

52
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:23,708
いちにのさん！
One, two, three!

53
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:27,158
飛んでけハイ！大きな声で叫んだら
Fly away, high! If you shout out loud

54
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:30,558
僕らのストーリーが今紡がれてく
Our story will be woven together now

55
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,258
もっともっと大きくね
Bigger and bigger

56
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,008
ボリュームはMAXで！
With the volume at max!

57
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:36,158
はじめまして、こんにちは！せーの
Nice to meet you, hello! One, two...

58
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:37,858
ホロライブだよ！
It's Hololive!

59
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:41,358
もう一度ハイ！そら遠くまで響け
Once more, high! Resonate far into the sky

60
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,758
はちゃめちゃで摩訶不思議にきらめいたんだ Dream☆Story
Messily and mysteriously, it sparkled, our Dream☆Story

61
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:48,558
やっぱ一秒たりとも体感してたいの
As expected, I want to experience every single second

62
00:07:48,658 --> 00:07:51,458
くらくらしちゃうくらい
So much it makes me dizzy

63
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:54,608
ああ だけど最高じゃない？
Ah, but isn't it the best?

64
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,208
ねえねえテンション 高まってアテンション
Hey, hey, tension, rising, attention!

65
00:07:58,308 --> 00:08:01,858
ワクワク警報は鳴り止まない
The excitement alarm won't stop ringing

66
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:05,358
ねえねえテンション 高まってアテンション
Hey, hey, tension, rising, attention!

67
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,858
誰も止められないわ！
Nobody can stop us!

68
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:26,558
飛んでけハイ！大きく息を吸ったら
Fly away, high! Take a deep breath

69
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:29,958
僕らのストーリーが今溢れ出すよ
And our story starts overflowing now

70
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:31,658
もっともっと大きくね
Bigger and bigger

71
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,458
最初が肝心なんです！
The beginning is crucial!

72
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,958
これからもさ、よろしくね！せーの
From now on too, please treat us well! One, two...

73
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,658
ホロライブだよ！
It's Hololive!

74
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:41,158
最後はハイ！そら遠くまで届け
Last one, high! Reach out far into the sky

75
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:44,608
ドキドキまで奇想天外に彩ったんだ Dream☆Story
Unexpectedly, even to the heartbeat, we've painted our Dream☆Story

76
00:08:44,728 --> 00:08:48,358
やっぱ一秒たりとも目を離さないで欲しいな
As expected, I don't want you to look away for even a second

77
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,258
まばたきもしてらんない
Can't even blink

78
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:54,608
ああ ほらね 最高でしょ？ イェイ！
Ah, see? It's the best, right? Yay!

79
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:26,558
みんなー、集合ー！
Everyone, gather 'round!

80
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,808
0期生ライブ、始まりましたー！
The 0th Gen Live has begun!

81
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:46,008
本日のハッシュタグはこちら！

たくさんポストしてください！
Please post a lot!

83
00:09:57,108 --> 00:09:59,208
そしてステージも見てー！
And look at the stage too!

84
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:07,072
ねー！
Hey!

85
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:07,478
はい！
Yes!

86
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:10,791
宝石をイメージしてステージを作ってもらいました！
They designed this stage with a jewelry theme in mind!

87
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,448
おおー！素敵ー！
Whoa! It's lovely!

88
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:16,061
ま、0期生初ライブなので
Well, since it's the first Gen 0 live...

89
00:10:16,061 --> 00:10:18,687
気合入れてもらっちゃったよね、うちら。
...we really went all out with the production, didn't we?

90
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:21,779
ありがとうございます！
Thank you so much!

91
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:26,021
そして、先ほど歌ったのがドリームストーリーだったんですけど
And we just sang "Dream Story" earlier...

92
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:28,792
はい。後ろに映像が流れてましたよね。
...and there was a video playing in the background, right?

93
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,448
流れてたー！
It was playing!

94
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:32,017
懐かしすぎた。
It was so nostalgic.

95
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:35,907
あちらですね、ファーストフェスの時の映像だったということで
That was actually footage from the First Fes...

96
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:39,448
4年半前でございます。
...which was four and a half years ago.

97
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:43,448
歴史を感じるね。やっぱ見ただけでわかるしね、なんかね。
You can really feel the history. You can tell just by looking at it.

98
00:10:44,017 --> 00:10:46,448
なんか私たちの姿めっちゃ変わってない？
Don't we look totally different?

99
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,907
そうだよね、成長したんだよね。
That's right, we've really grown.

100
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,578
成長したよねー。
We sure have.

101
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,070
みこも成長したよね。
Miko has grown too.

102
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,081
成長したー！
You have!

103
00:10:57,081 --> 00:10:59,092
あづきも。
AZKi too.

104
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:02,448
恥ずかしすぎたな。
That was so embarrassing.

105
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:04,578
エモいな。
It's so moving.

106
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:09,448
そんなね、私たちは今日はね、お互いのいろんな曲を歌っていくので
Anyway, we'll be singing various songs of each other's today...

107
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:12,578
どの曲を歌うか楽しみにしていてください！
...so please look forward to seeing which ones we perform!

108
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,017
はーい！
Okay!

109
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:18,448
では早速ですが、次の曲に行きましょう！
Now, without further ado, let's move on to the next song!

110
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:20,448
準備してきました！
We're ready!

111
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:23,448
お着替え行ってきまーす！
We're going to go change!

112
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:33,579
飛んで来な
Fly on over

113
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:34,579
めちゃ進む
Keep moving forward

114
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:37,057
都市部を抜けて遊び場へ
Through the city to the playground

115
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:39,448
いぇーい！
Yay!

116
00:11:40,536 --> 00:11:46,536
ハジメノイッポ
作詞・作曲・編曲：ナユタン星人
Hajimeno Ippo
Lyrics, Composition, & Arrangement: Nayutalien

117
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:50,907
前人未到のトキメキ知りたい人？
Who wants to know an unprecedented thrill?

118
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:52,578
いっせーの いーんじゃない？
All together now, isn't it fine?

119
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,067
今だっていいんじゃない？
Isn't it fine right now?

120
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:56,077
希望の通り遊びたい人？
Who wants to play just as they hope?

121
00:11:56,578 --> 00:11:58,067
それって君じゃない？
Isn't that you?

122
00:11:58,067 --> 00:11:59,878
今日はいっちゃいいんじゃない？
Isn't it fine to go for it today?

123
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:01,578
タイム・イズ・マネー
Time is money

124
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:02,878
そりゃ何のマネ？
What kind of imitation is that?

125
00:12:02,878 --> 00:12:05,067
寄り道こそ人生の醍醐味です
Detours are the best part of life

126
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,878
行きたい方にダッシュ
Dash in the direction you want to go

127
00:12:06,878 --> 00:12:08,578
そんでハート奪取
And steal some hearts

128
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:11,067
この作戦 もう怪し隠すはない
This plan, there's no more hiding the suspicion

129
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,578
動かなかった足を
My feet that wouldn't move

130
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:16,578
今は踏み出したいと思える
Now I feel like I want to take a step forward

131
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:19,578
一人ではできなかったこと
Things I couldn't do alone

132
00:12:19,878 --> 00:12:21,578
やっちゃうよ？行っちゃうよ？いっせーの！
I'll do it! I'm going! One, two!

133
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:24,578
一層一層さ ぶっ飛んでいくぞ
Higher and higher, we're gonna blast off

134
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,578
ぐんぐんこの調子 霧はまだまだ
Keep up this pace, the mist is still there

135
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,578
でも一歩一歩って 進んでいくぞ
But step by step, we'll keep moving forward

136
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:33,578
これが我らの第一歩
This is our first step

137
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:36,578
しかと見ていてくださいな
Please keep a close watch on us

やっぱパパッパッパ
As expected, pa-pa-pa-pa

181
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:07,409
やっぱりポッポッポッにしたい
I still want to make it pop-pop-pop!

182
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:09,359
やわなポッポッ諸症状で
With soft pop-pop symptoms,

183
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:11,509
私世界バッテ・オーライがって
I'm getting all right with the world's battery.

184
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:14,509
ノンノンなんてなってんだ
What's with all the "non-non"?

185
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:17,759
湿っぽいポイでさ歌っちゃって
Throwing away the dampness and singing along.

186
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,059
どうにかなることと
Things that'll work out,

187
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:22,209
ならないことね　わくわく
and things that won't. So exciting!

188
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:25,459
さくらってモラみこの時代よ
This is the era of Sakura and Mora-Miko!

189
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:29,009
知りたい　嘘つきたい　勝ちたいよ　日向
I want to know, I want to lie, I want to win, Sunbeam!

190
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:32,559
未体験じゃんけんだ　オイ　オイ
It's an unexperienced rock-paper-scissors. Oi! Oi!

191
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,859
ヤバイ　Sugar Rush　アゲチュンチュンにさせて
Oh no! Sugar Rush, make me feel all hyped up!

192
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:39,709
もっと　もっと　おたべ　召しませ
Have some more, more, please eat up!

193
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:43,009
変幻自在のドキドキが
This ever-changing heart-pounding feeling,

194
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:47,159
Because ぱんぱかぱんぱぱらっぱんでもう一回
Because pan-paka-pan-paparappan, one more time!

195
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,309
Sugar Rush　アゲチュンチュンばやしして
Sugar Rush, give me that hyped-up rhythm!

196
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:54,059
もっと　もっと　踊る　求めて
More and more, seeking to dance!

197
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:57,409
全然足んないよ　そんな数じゃ
It's not enough at all, with just that amount!

198
00:15:57,409 --> 00:16:01,259
Because ぱんぱかぱんぱぱらっぱんでもう一回
Because pan-paka-pan-paparappan, one more time!

199
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:05,059
教えて Sugar Beat 触れないと
Tell me, Sugar Beat, if I don't touch it...

200
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:09,409
やっぱポッポッポッにしたい
I still want to make it pop-pop-pop!

201
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:13,809
遊びたい騒ぎたい全部忘れたい泣きたい気持ち　しくしくしくしく
I want to play, party, forget everything, a feeling like crying, sob-sob-sob!

202
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:16,609
頭と体バラバラ　まだまだ行けるわ長距離
Head and body all apart, I can still go the distance!

203
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:20,409
強がり快感　パニックになっちゃえば
Feeling good being tough, just getting into a panic!

204
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:22,209
最初はグッとやる気満々
At first, I'm all full of motivation!

205
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:24,059
だけどちょっと辛いからダンダン
But it's a bit tough, so bit by bit...

206
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:25,909
マイクとパッと切り替えて
Quickly switching with the mic!

207
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:27,709
本気負けで愛顧それも怖キャラ
Losing for real and getting favors, that's a scary character too!

208
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,309
最初はグッとやる気満々
At first, I'm all full of motivation!

209
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:31,009
だけどちょっと辛いからダンダン
But it's a bit tough, so bit by bit...

210
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:32,809
マイクとパッと切り替えなきゃ
I've gotta switch quickly with the mic!

211
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:34,209
ダメダメダメダメ
No, no, no, no!

212
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:37,809
とんでもないことは　望んでいるのだ　わくわく
I'm wishing for something unbelievable. So exciting!

213
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:41,509
しながら死にたくて　笑いたい
I want to die while doing it, and I want to laugh!

214
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:45,209
叶えたい　上がっちゃうの止めないで
I want to make it come true, don't stop me from rising!

215
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:48,609
安い世界なんて　ポイ　ポイ
Toss away this cheap world!

216
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:52,009
ださい情緒まちまえ　エイ　エイ
Mix up those tacky emotions. Hey! Hey!

217
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:55,259
ヤバイ　Sugar Rush　アゲチュンチュンにさせて
Oh no! Sugar Rush, make me feel all hyped up!

化けて出ちゃうよ　死なないよ
I'll come out as a ghost! I won't die!

227
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:36,909
Because ぱんぱかぱんぱぱらっぱん

232
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:24,609
窓に当たる陽を横目で眺めて　そっと陰る木の根に一人で比べてた
Gazing sideways at the sun hitting the window,
I quietly compared myself to the shadows of the tree roots.

233
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:35,909
積もる溜息を吹き払うように　そんな私を君が見つけてくれたんだ
As if blowing away my accumulating sighs,
you were the one who found me like that.

234
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:47,309
そう　それは恋のような温もりを全部　君に笑顔咲かせたら
Yes, if I could make all that warmth, like love,
bloom into a smile for you...

235
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:58,609
サクラカゼに踊る空　君と出会ったこの場所で
The sky dances in the cherry blossom breeze,
in this place where I met you.

236
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:04,609
どれくらいの想い出ぎゅっと　溢れそうになるかな
How many memories will I hold tight
until they're about to overflow?

237
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:10,209
君と流した涙は　明日の笑顔の糧にしよう
The tears I shed with you,
let's make them nourishment for tomorrow's smiles.

238
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:16,209
膝をついてたってほら　何度だっていいよ
Look, even if you fall to your knees,
it's okay, however many times it takes.

239
00:19:16,209 --> 00:19:22,209
意地を張って恥をかいて　いじけたってそれでも
Being stubborn, being embarrassed, even sulking, despite it all...

240
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:28,209
君が傍で見守ってくれたこと
The fact that you watched over me by my side...

241
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:31,059
分かってるから
I understand that now.

242
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:44,309
追い風を受けて止まらない日々も　そっと挫けそうになって心が渦巻いた
Even on days when I couldn't stop, pushed by the tailwind,
my heart would swirl, on the verge of giving up.

243
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:55,709
積もる溜息でまた泣きかけても　温かな手でずっと支えてくれたんだ
Even when I was about to cry again from accumulating sighs,
you were always there to support me with your warm hands.

244
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:08,122
ほら 耳を澄ませば
See, if you listen closely

245
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,592
一人じゃないから
Because you're not alone

246
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:21,492
諦めかけて心が閉じても
Even if you're about to give up and your heart closes

247
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:27,092
君が背中を押してくれたよね
You pushed me forward, didn't you?

248
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:32,842
春の蕾が花開く頃は
When the spring buds begin to bloom

249
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:38,442
隣で笑い合おうね
Let's laugh together side by side

250
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:45,642
桜風に踊る空 君と出会ったこの場所で
The sky dancing in the cherry blossom breeze, here where I met you

251
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:51,342
どれくらいの思い出 ぎゅっと溢れそうになるかな
How many memories will overflow as I hold them tight?

252
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:56,842
君と描く言の葉は 未来もきっと残るから
The words I draw with you will surely remain in the future

253
00:20:57,442 --> 00:21:02,842
汗をかいた後は そうさ 強くなれるんだ
After sweating it out, yes, we can become stronger

254
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:08,442
意地を張って 恥をかいて いじけたって それでも
Being stubborn, being embarrassed, even if we sulk

255
00:21:09,242 --> 00:21:13,442
君がそばで見守ってくれたから
Because you were there by my side watching over me

256
00:21:13,992 --> 00:21:17,042
ありがとうだよ
Thank you so much

257
00:21:25,642 --> 00:21:33,642
君と出会えたこの空 これからもずっと咲かせるよ
This sky where I could meet you, I'll keep it blooming forever

258
00:22:00,342 --> 00:22:05,242
あの涙が今の僕らを繋げて
Those tears connect us now

259
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:11,842
この心に君のカケラがいるから
Because there's a piece of you in this heart

260
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:16,442
一人じゃないから
Because I'm not alone

262
00:22:29,342 --> 00:22:33,442
いつか描いた文字の中
In the letters I once wrote

263
00:22:33,992 --> 00:22:39,992
目を閉じた先に色付く景色が揺れた
A colorful landscape swayed before my closed eyes

264
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:44,992
少し戸惑う風の中
In a slightly confusing wind

265
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:51,142
重なる花びら 私たちの声
Overlapping petals, our voices

266
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:56,992
一瞬一瞬捕まえるみたいに
Like catching moment after moment

267
00:22:57,392 --> 00:23:01,492
もっともっと踏み出せたら
If we could take even more steps forward

268
00:23:02,142 --> 00:23:03,942
(We are one)

269
00:23:05,392 --> 00:23:10,692
あの涙が今の僕らを繋げて
Those tears connect us now

270
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:16,292
この心に君のカケラがいるから
Because there's a piece of you in this heart

271
00:23:16,892 --> 00:23:19,392
強くなくてもいい
It's okay not to be strong

272
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:22,392
今の光を
This light now

273
00:23:22,892 --> 00:23:27,892
僕と君と集う空に放つ
Unleash it into the sky where you and I gather

274
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:33,892
この奇跡を僕らでそっと輝かせるから
Because we will gently make this miracle shine

275
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:39,692
力が湧くから
Because power wells up within

276
00:23:43,892 --> 00:23:47,492
新たな種を握りしめ
Gripping a new seed

277
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:53,892
遠い未来へと強く願い込め蒔いた
I sowed it with a strong wish for the distant future

278
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:58,992
希望の風を吹かせては
Letting the wind of hope blow

279
00:23:59,492 --> 00:24:05,292
理想の花びら 祈る明日の空
Ideal petals, praying to tomorrow's sky

280
00:24:05,992 --> 00:24:10,992
何百億も光る星みたいに
Like tens of billions of shining stars

281
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:15,992
ずっとずっと終わらないから
Because it will never, ever end

282
00:24:16,992 --> 00:24:22,392
この笑顔が過去を強く抱きしめて
This smile strongly embraces the past

283
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:28,192
今未来にこの手伸ばしてゆくから
Because I'm reaching out to the future now

284
00:24:28,692 --> 00:24:31,292
時に転んでも
Even if we stumble sometimes

285
00:24:31,692 --> 00:24:34,292
空を見上げよう
Let's look up at the sky

286
00:24:34,692 --> 00:24:39,692
笑い日々を刻んでゆく
Carving out days of laughter

287
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:45,692
次の夢を掴み取るって約束するから
Because I promise to grasp the next dream

288
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:51,192
踏み出そうここから
Let's step forward from here

289
00:24:59,492 --> 00:25:06,842
(We are with you We are with you)

290
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:09,101
(We are with you We are with you)

291
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:12,601
同じ未来を見ていたい
I want to keep looking at the same future

292
00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:15,601
あの夢手にしてたい
I want to keep holding that dream

293
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:21,101
(We are with you Capture The Moment)

294
00:25:21,301 --> 00:25:25,601
触れた奇跡の中で
Within the miracle we touched

295
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:32,601
その先まで続く空にまぎれたら
If we get lost in the sky that stretches beyond

296
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:38,101
君の場所と今を繋げたくて
Wanting to connect your place and the present

297
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:44,301
あの涙が今の僕らをつなげて
Those tears connect us now

298
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:49,601
この心に君のカケラがいるから
Because a piece of you is in this heart

299
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:52,901
強くなくてもいい
It's okay not to be strong

300
00:25:53,101 --> 00:25:55,601
今の光を
The light of now

301
00:25:55,901 --> 00:26:00,101
僕と君と集う全ての空に放つ
Releasing into the entire sky where you and I gather

302
00:26:00,301 --> 00:26:07,101
この奇跡を僕らでそっと輝かせるから
Because we will gently make this miracle shine

303
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:12,601
咲かせようここから
Let's make it bloom from here

304
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:16,601
一人じゃないから
Because you are not alone

305
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:20,101
(We are one)

306
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:48,601
褪せたハチミドリ
Faded Honeybird

307
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:48,601
作詞・作曲・編曲：宮田'レフィ'リョウ
Lyrics, Composition, Arrangement: Miyata 'Lefty' Ryo

308
00:26:52,601 --> 00:26:56,101
恋に恋してるあの子が
That girl who's in love with love

309
00:26:56,301 --> 00:27:01,601
口ずさんでた流行りの歌
Was humming a popular song

310
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:06,601
反吐が出るくらい 甘い 甘い 言葉を踊って
Dancing to words so sweet they make me sick

311
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:11,101
くるまれてケミカルな菓子みたい
Wrapped up like a chemical candy

312
00:27:11,301 --> 00:27:13,101
Ah Ah もういいよ
Ah ah, enough already

313
00:27:13,301 --> 00:27:16,601
並べたセリフで飾って
Decorated with lined-up lines

314
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:18,601
隙あらば夜伽に誘って
Inviting to a night-watch at every chance

315
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:23,101
求愛行動ってやつさ 痴れ者暴れ獣
It's just a mating ritual, a foolish rampaging beast

316
00:27:23,301 --> 00:27:25,601
気づいて 所詮愛なんて
Notice that, after all, love is just...

317
00:27:25,901 --> 00:27:28,601
...建前どこにもありはしない
...a facade, it doesn't exist anywhere

318
00:27:28,901 --> 00:27:31,601
信じたいけど
I want to believe, but...

319
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:36,101
どうせ叶わぬ約束 綻ぶ愛情
Promises that won't come true anyway, unraveling affection

320
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:42,601
ただ綺麗な言葉はいらない
I just don't need pretty words

321
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:47,601
未来永劫訪れない世界なら
If it's a world that will never come for all eternity

322
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:51,101
その手でいっそ止めて
Then just stop it with those hands

323
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:04,601
枯れた思い出に浮かぶハチミドリ
A honeybird floating in withered memories

324
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:10,301
二人肩並べ歩いた目黒通りの桜
The cherry blossoms of Meguro Street where we walked side-by-side

325
00:28:10,601 --> 00:28:14,601
いつまでもずっとこのままでいようね
Let's stay like this forever...

326
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:19,101
...囁いた声のまやかし
...was the deception of a whispered voice

327
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:23,301
もういいよ 不埒な街を彷徨って
Enough already, wandering through this insolent city

328
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:26,601
着飾った安酒に酔って
Getting drunk on dressed-up cheap liquor

329
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:31,101
身を委ねておこう 私だって寂しいんだもの
I'll just surrender myself, because I'm lonely too

330
00:28:31,301 --> 00:28:33,601
不敵な罪を重ねても
Even if I pile up bold sins

331
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:36,601
貴方は振り返りもしない
You won't even look back

332
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:39,101
分かってるけど
I know, but...

333
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:43,601
どうせ果たせぬ結実 綻ぶ愛情
Fruition that won't be achieved anyway, unraveling affection

334
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:50,301
あんなに好きを重ねていたって
Even though we piled up so much "love"

335
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:54,101
今じゃもう何事もなかったかのように
Now, as if nothing had ever happened...

336
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:57,601
...外れてしまうなんて
...it just comes apart

337
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:24,601
さよなら 純情 もう戻れないや
Goodbye, pure heart, I can't go back anymore

338
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:29,101
そんだけ大きな恋をしたんだ
I was in love that much

339
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:33,301
全てが空ろの嘘に見えても
Even if everything looks like a hollow lie

340
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:37,101
愛を探していく
I'll keep searching for love

341
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:41,601
どうせ叶わぬ約束 綻ぶ愛情
Promises that won't come true anyway, unraveling affection

342
00:29:41,901 --> 00:29:46,601
ただ綺麗な言葉はいらない
I just don't need pretty words

343
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:51,101
未来永劫訪れない世界なら
If it's a world that will never come for all eternity

344
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:55,101
その手でいっそ止めて
Then just stop it with those hands

345
00:30:20,124 --> 00:30:25,124
アザミナ
Azamina

346
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:32,690
ひらり ふらり 彷徨ってく 白い夢は もうやめた
Fluttering and swaying, wandering along, I’m done with that white dream.

347
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:39,857
私ずっと知ってたの 匂いに誘われて落ちてく
I’ve known it all along, lured by the scent and falling.

348
00:30:54,457 --> 00:31:00,724
与えられた役目を尋ねることが怖くて
Afraid to ask about the role I was given.

349
00:31:00,724 --> 00:31:08,124
流れる日々の答えに濁したのは心だけ
In the answers of passing days, only my heart was clouded.

350
00:31:08,124 --> 00:31:14,624
定められた箱の中 味気ない寂しさが
Inside the predestined box, a tasteless loneliness.

351
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:21,624
少しずつ侵食してた 漂う地も知らぬまま
It was eroding me little by little, without me even knowing where I was drifting.

352
00:31:21,624 --> 00:31:28,624
しまい隠したはずだった ただの戯言
It was supposed to be tucked away, just mere nonsense.

353
00:31:28,624 --> 00:31:35,724
分かってる 奥に潜む その目で見たまぎれもない衝動
I know, lurking deep inside, is that unmistakable impulse you saw with those eyes.

354
00:31:35,724 --> 00:31:42,824
ひらり ゆらりとんでいける 迷い惑い 閉じ込めた
Fluttering and swaying, I can fly away, trapping my hesitation and confusion.

355
00:31:42,824 --> 00:31:49,890
あなたはもう 離さないで やがて嘘と知っても
Don’t let go of me anymore, even if you eventually find out it was a lie.

356
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:56,624
ひらり ふらり 彷徨ってく 白い夢は もうやめた
Fluttering and swaying, wandering along, I’m done with that white dream.

357
00:31:56,624 --> 00:32:03,790
私ずっと知ってたの 匂いに誘われて落ちてく
I’ve known it all along, lured by the scent and falling.

358
00:32:17,857 --> 00:32:24,357
まとわりつく言葉だけ 何の意味もないくせに
Only the words that cling to me, even though they have no meaning.

359
00:32:24,357 --> 00:32:31,524
背負わされてる重さに 潰れそうでもがいてた
Struggling as I’m about to be crushed by the weight I’m forced to carry.

360
00:32:31,524 --> 00:32:38,524
気付かないふりしていたの 交わすすべてを
I was pretending not to notice everything we exchanged.

361
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:45,224
囁いた我に染まる 覚悟と甘さの代償 それだけ
That’s all—the price of the determination and sweetness that stains the self I whispered.

362
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:52,324
ひらり ゆらり舞い降りてく 迷い惑い 脱ぎ捨てて
Fluttering and swaying, I dance down, casting off my hesitation and confusion.

363
00:32:52,324 --> 00:32:59,324
あなたはもう 離さないで やがて嘘と知っても
Don’t let go of me anymore, even if you eventually find out it was a lie.

364
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:06,290
ひらり ふらり落とされてく 白い夢は もうやめた
Fluttering and swaying, being dropped down, I’m done with that white dream.

365
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:13,224
私きっと戻らない 匂いに誘われて落ちてく
I surely won’t go back, lured by the scent and falling.

366
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:20,290
ひらり ゆらりとんでいける 迷い惑い 閉じ込めた
Fluttering and swaying, I can fly away, trapping my hesitation and confusion.

367
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:27,257
あなたはもう 離さないで やがて嘘と知っても
Don’t let go of me anymore, even if you eventually find out it was a lie.

368
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:30,624
ひらり ふらり 彷徨ってく
Fluttering and swaying, wandering along.

369
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,824
白い夢は もうやめた
I’m done with that white dream.

370
00:33:33,824 --> 00:33:40,924
私ずっと知ってたの 匂いに誘われて落ちてく
I’ve known it all along, lured by the scent and falling.

371
00:34:21,124 --> 00:34:26,124
いのち(2024 ver.)
Inochi (2024 ver.)

372
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:26,690
息をしている だから生きている
I am breathing, therefore I am alive.

373
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,790
何度もずっと言葉を尽くしてきたんだ
I have used all my words over and over again.

374
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:36,257
息をしているように見えている
It seems as though I am breathing.

375
00:34:36,257 --> 00:34:41,924
綻び出す私にとっての何か
Something that begins to fray within me.

376
00:34:43,524 --> 00:34:48,690
鼓動がドクドクしている
My heart is thumping.

377
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:54,690
ここはいつも変わらずに
This place remains unchanged, as always.

378
00:34:54,690 --> 00:35:01,824
急かし続ける音一つの命
A single life, a sound that keeps on rushing.

379
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:06,124
最後まで私のこと
Until the very end, about me...

380
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:07,948
...見届けてくれるの
...will you watch over me?

381
00:35:07,948 --> 00:35:10,448
消えてしまいそうなの
I feel like I'm about to disappear.

382
00:35:10,448 --> 00:35:13,448
わかってよ わかってよ ねえ
Please understand, please understand.

383
00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:15,948
ホントのことなの
It's the truth.

384
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:18,448
いずれは卒業するんでしょう
Someday I'll graduate, right?

385
00:35:18,448 --> 00:35:21,448
日常に戻ったら
When I return to daily life,

386
00:35:21,448 --> 00:35:24,448
私は いなくなるの
I will be gone.

387
00:35:24,648 --> 00:35:29,648
命のような 夢を見てるよ
I'm having a dream like a life.

388
00:35:29,648 --> 00:35:33,648
またね バイバイ
See you later, bye-bye.

389
00:35:45,348 --> 00:35:47,648
息をしている
I'm breathing.

390
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:50,148
だから生きている
That's why I'm alive.

391
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:55,648
見ためと中身の境界線 跨いで戻って
Crossing the boundary between appearance and essence and returning.

392
00:35:55,648 --> 00:35:58,348
音が止まって
The sound stops,

393
00:35:58,348 --> 00:36:00,948
動かなくなって
and stops moving.

394
00:36:00,948 --> 00:36:05,648
そんな私を君は笑ってくれるかな
Will you smile at me like that?

395
00:36:08,148 --> 00:36:10,948
鼓動がトクトクしている
My heart is beating fast.

396
00:36:13,648 --> 00:36:18,648
ここはいつも変わらずに 巡り続ける
This place keeps on turning, unchanging as ever.

397
00:36:19,648 --> 00:36:24,948
キボウしたいの 命
I want to hope, my life.

398
00:36:27,148 --> 00:36:32,648
最後まで私のこと 見届けてくれるの
Will you watch over me until the end?

399
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,648
縋ってしまいそうなの
I feel like I might cling to you.

400
00:36:35,648 --> 00:36:37,648
わかってよ わかってよ ねえ
Please understand, please understand.

401
00:36:37,648 --> 00:36:42,648
真実を繋いだら もう二度と戻せないのに
Once the truth is connected, it can never be undone.

402
00:36:42,648 --> 00:36:48,648
君が忘れちゃったら 私は いなくなるの
If you forget, I will be gone.

403
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:53,948
命のような 夢を見てるよ
I'm having a dream like a life.

404
00:36:53,948 --> 00:36:57,648
またね バイバイ
See you later, bye-bye.

405
00:36:58,648 --> 00:37:05,648
生き急いだあの日を 軽く弄らないで
Don't lightly mock those days when I lived so fast.

406
00:37:05,648 --> 00:37:08,648
励まして
Encourage me.

407
00:37:09,148 --> 00:37:16,648
それが生きる糧になるから
Because that will become the fuel for living.

408
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:28,148
大丈夫 ずっと私は 歌い続けるから
It's okay, because I will keep on singing forever.

409
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:38,148
最後まで私も 生きているか分からないけど
I don't know if I'll be alive until the end, either,

410
00:37:38,148 --> 00:37:43,648
君がくれた言葉は 確かに残ってる
but the words you gave me certainly remain.

411
00:37:43,648 --> 00:37:49,148
最後まで私のこと 覚えていなくてもいいから
It's okay if you don't remember me until the end.

412
00:37:49,148 --> 00:37:54,148
いつ死んでしまうだろ 分かんない 分かんないよ
I don't know when I might die, I don't know, I don't know.

413
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:59,648
でも今君が笑えたこと それだけで意味があること
But the fact that you could smile now, that alone has meaning.

414
00:37:59,648 --> 00:38:05,148
君が忘れちゃっても 私は 死なないから
Even if you forget, I won't die.

415
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:10,148
命のような 夢を見てるよ
I'm having a dream like a life.

416
00:38:10,148 --> 00:38:14,148
またね バイバイ
See you later, bye-bye.

417
00:39:06,348 --> 00:39:09,348
ここに宣言します
I hereby declare.

418
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:13,648

00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:40,648
すこやかなるときも ずっと
and always in good health.

422
00:39:40,648 --> 00:39:44,648

To keep singing of love,

00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:48,648
堂々と誓います
I solemnly swear.

424
00:39:48,648 --> 00:39:52,648
ふたつ 歌だとか ダンスももっと追求します
Two, I will pursue singing and dancing even more.

425
00:39:55,148 --> 00:39:59,648
みっつ ずっと推してもらえる
Three, to be an idol

426
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:03,648
アイドルになってみせます
that you can keep supporting.

427
00:40:03,648 --> 00:40:05,948
よっつめ 不安な
Four, even when anxious...

428
00:40:06,172 --> 00:40:10,672
…未来も 私が照らすんだ
...I will light up the future too.

429
00:40:10,672 --> 00:40:15,272
それでも 落ち込んじゃう日は
Even so, on days when I'm feeling down,

430
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:21,672
思い出しているよ みんなのその笑顔 その声を
I remember everyone's smiles and voices.

434
00:40:33,672 --> 00:40:37,472
ほらね笑う 門にそら来たる
See, Sora comes to those who smile.

435
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:41,972
Happy Birthday 毎日がほら
Happy Birthday, see, every day is...

436
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:45,772

437
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:50,372
生まれ変わっても 迷わずに
Even if I'm reborn, without hesitation,

438
00:40:50,372 --> 00:40:55,372
君だけの アイドルになるよ
I'll become your one and only idol.

いつ アイドルとは
When they say an idol

442
00:41:19,772 --> 00:41:23,572
時にあざとくが お決まりと
must be "azatoi" as a rule...

443
00:41:23,572 --> 00:41:27,372
誰かが言ってたけど
someone said that, but

444
00:41:27,372 --> 00:41:31,172
上手く 出来ないのです
I can't do it very well.

445
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:35,572
ねぇ もっと詰めて
Hey, get closer,

446
00:41:35,572 --> 00:41:38,572

永遠に愛します セブンスホイッスル
I'll love you forever, Seventh Whistle.

458
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:26,672
そらちゃーん！ / いぇーい！
Sora-chan! / Yay!

459
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:32,572
新曲めっちゃ良かった！ / 良かったー！ / すごーい！
The new song was so good! / It was great! / Amazing!

460
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:35,672
初披露！ / 初披露！
First performance! / First performance!

461
00:43:35,772 --> 00:43:38,372
おめでたいですね。 / おめでとー！
How wonderful. / Congratulations!

462
00:43:38,472 --> 00:43:43,972
7周年おめでとう！ / ありがとうー！
Congratulations on your 7th anniversary! / Thank you!

463
00:43:44,072 --> 00:43:48,272
でもちょっと複雑なんだけど、0期生全員の周年ではないんですよね。
It's a bit complicated, but it's not the anniversary for all of Gen 0.

464
00:43:48,372 --> 00:43:52,572
そうなんだよね、みんなデビュー日が違ったりからね。
That's true, everyone has different debut dates.

465
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:57,372
それがね、こうやって集まったということで。はぁ〜…
But here we are, gathered like this. Phew...

466
00:43:57,672 --> 00:44:00,772
セトリとかもめちゃくちゃ考えたじゃないですか。
We really thought a lot about the setlist, didn't we?

467
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:04,972
そうだね、組み合わせどうしようとか。
Yeah, like what combinations to do.

468
00:44:05,072 --> 00:44:09,372
めちゃくちゃ悩んだ、大会議したよね。
We agonized over it, had a big meeting.

469
00:44:09,572 --> 00:44:14,672
でもみこがすごいびっくりしたのは、0期生でこうやって集まっていろいろ考えると…
But what really surprised Miko was, when Gen 0 gathers like this and thinks about things...

470
00:44:14,772 --> 00:44:18,572
もう誰かがメモを取って、誰かがまとめて、みたいな。
someone takes notes, someone summarizes...

471
00:44:18,672 --> 00:44:21,672
すごく役割分担もしてたりとか。
We even had roles assigned.

472
00:44:21,772 --> 00:44:26,572
みんななんか「任せるよ」っていうのがなく、こだわりがちゃんとあるから。
No one just says "I'll leave it to you," everyone has their own preferences.

473
00:44:26,672 --> 00:44:30,572
すごい素敵だったなって。
I thought it was really wonderful.

474
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:36,172
チャンスだった、すごかったよ。 / 流石だったよ本当。 / 素敵だったよ。
It was our chance, it was great. / You were amazing, really. / It was lovely.

475
00:44:36,672 --> 00:44:40,572
せっかくだから、スクショ撮りたい！
Since we're all here, I want to take a screenshot!

476
00:44:40,672 --> 00:44:42,672
撮りたい！スクショ撮ろう！
I want to! Let's take a screenshot!

477
00:44:43,672 --> 00:44:45,572
撮るぞ！ / どうやって撮る？
Let's do it! / How should we pose?

478
00:44:45,672 --> 00:44:49,572
まずそらちゃんちょっと真ん中にいていただいて。
First, Sora-chan, please stay in the middle.

479
00:44:50,372 --> 00:44:53,572
え、なんか上下とかになる？
Should we do like high and low positions?

480
00:44:53,672 --> 00:44:57,372
え、待って、戦隊？ / どういう上下？
Wait, like Super Sentai? / What kind of high and low?

481
00:44:57,472 --> 00:45:00,372
すぐにこういう時戦隊になるんだから。
We always turn into a Sentai team at times like this.

482
00:45:00,472 --> 00:45:02,672
かん？ / はい、何のポーズ？
Ready? / Okay, what pose?

483
00:45:02,772 --> 00:45:06,172
分かんない！何ですかこれ？
I don't know! What even is this?

484
00:45:06,196 --> 00:45:09,696
いいじゃない！いいじゃない！
It's nice! It's nice!

485
00:45:09,696 --> 00:45:13,196
周りにいない？パシャパシャ！いいじゃない！
Are there any others around? Click click! It's nice!

486
00:45:13,596 --> 00:45:17,196
一番プリンセスみたい。えーと、他には？
She looks the most like a princess. Um, what else?

487
00:45:17,396 --> 00:45:20,696
あ、客席側……あ、確かに。客席に行ってもらう。
Ah, the audience side... Ah, certainly. Let's have them go to the seats.

488
00:45:21,696 --> 00:45:25,196
客席さーん！おいでー！
Audience members! Come here!

489
00:45:28,196 --> 00:45:32,196
よくさ、座ってやるやつ撮りたい。
I want to take that photo where we sit down.

490
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:37,196
待って、これさ、この流れ知ってる。そらちゃんと客席と撮っていた時も毎回これ……
Wait, I know this flow. It was like this every time we took photos with the audience during Sora-chan's section too...

491
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:40,696
やったよ！同じことやったよ！自然とこうなっちゃうね。
We did it! We did the same thing! It just naturally ends up like this.

492
00:45:41,596 --> 00:45:46,196
やっぱりやりたいじゃん！2024年も変わっていません！
We still want to do it! Nothing has changed in 2024!

493
00:45:51,196 --> 00:45:54,696
エモだね。エモだね。エモだよねー！
It's emotional. It's emotional. It really is emotional!

494
00:45:56,196 --> 00:45:59,196
あれもやるんじゃない？0期生列車。
Aren't we doing that too? The Gen 0 Train.

495
00:45:59,696 --> 00:46:03,196
0期生列車！0期生列車！はい！いいよ、後で……
Gen 0 Train! Gen 0 Train! Yes! Okay, later...

496
00:46:04,696 --> 00:46:09,196
行くよ！出発！0期生列車！
Here we go! Departure! Gen 0 Train!

497
00:46:20,696 --> 00:46:24,696
待って、もしかして0期生天然多いのかな？やばいやばい、後で気付いた。
Wait, are there a lot of airheads in Gen 0? Oh no, I just realized.

498
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:29,196
楽しかった、楽しかった。進もう、次に。
That was fun, that was fun. Let's move on to the next one.

499
00:46:32,196 --> 00:46:36,196
はい、というわけでね、楽しいMCもありましたが……
Yes, so, we had a fun MC section, but...

500
00:46:36,196 --> 00:46:39,696
みんなさ、みんなのそらも見たいよね！
Everyone, you want to see everyone's Sora too, right!

501
00:46:40,196 --> 00:46:44,196
見たいよねー！どうかな？
You want to see her, right! How about it?

502
00:46:46,196 --> 00:46:52,196
ということで、ライブも中盤戦！まだまだ盛り上がっていくので、楽しんでください！
So, the live is in its middle stage! We're going to keep the excitement going, so please enjoy!

503
00:46:56,196 --> 00:47:00,196

Where is my assembly wind-up heart?

509
00:47:38,596 --> 00:47:41,496
おかしいね おかしいね くだらないね イヤイヤ
It's strange, it's strange, it's trivial, no no

510
00:47:41,496 --> 00:47:44,996
わけないね わけないね ハイスペックなんて
It's easy, it's easy, something like high-spec

511
00:47:44,996 --> 00:47:48,196
最先端の坊 やらわか滑走
Cutting-edge boy, soft gliding

512
00:47:48,496 --> 00:47:52,696
ドキドキが止まりそう ネジ巻いて
My heart feels like it's going to stop, wind the spring

513
00:47:52,696 --> 00:47:56,296
りるびなってゆくの覚えて ネジ巻いてネジ巻いてよ
Remember becoming Lilybe, wind the spring, wind the spring for me

514
00:47:56,296 --> 00:47:59,496
ちょっとだけね ちょちょちょっとだけね
Just a little bit, just a little bit

515
00:47:59,496 --> 00:48:03,196
ピッポッパポ鳴らして夢を作る
Beep boop, making dreams

ちょっとだけね ちょっとだけね
Just a little bit, just a little bit

517
00:48:06,296 --> 00:48:10,696
でもちょっとだけじゃそのうち足りなくなるかも
But if it's just a little bit, soon it might not be enough

518
00:48:11,196 --> 00:48:14,696
りるび りるび…… もっと

画面の中の君が好き
作詞・作曲・編曲：瀬名航
I Like the You Inside the Screen
Lyrics, Composition, Arrangement: Wataru Sena

534
00:49:44,196 --> 00:49:48,696
君を初めて見つけた時
When I first found you

535
00:49:49,196 --> 00:49:53,796
なぜか心揺さぶられたんだ
For some reason, my heart was shaken

536
00:49:54,196 --> 00:49:58,696
すぐにものに命を宿す
Immediately breathing life into things

537
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:03,996
君の輝きは本物だった
Your radiance was the real thing

538
00:50:06,521 --> 00:50:08,721
君は素敵だった
You were wonderful

539
00:50:10,121 --> 00:50:12,021
画面の中の君が好き
I love the you inside the screen

540
00:50:12,321 --> 00:50:14,221
画面の中の君が好き
I love the you inside the screen

541
00:50:14,521 --> 00:50:16,721
画面の中の君が好き
I love the you inside the screen

542
00:50:16,821 --> 00:50:19,621
その希少な君の顔が
That rare face of yours...

543
00:50:19,721 --> 00:50:23,721
ただ君が笑えたらいい
I just want you to be able to laugh

544
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:28,721
本当の君とは実は違うとしても
Even if it's actually different from the real you

545
00:50:29,021 --> 00:50:34,221
新しい扉を開けて息をしようよ
Let's open a new door and breathe

546
00:50:35,621 --> 00:50:39,221
嘘も本当も関係ないから
Because lies and truth don't matter

547
00:50:39,421 --> 00:50:44,021
息をしてる瞬間を僕らに届けていたいんだ
I want to deliver to us the moments you are breathing

548
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:47,721
君が好きだから
Because I love you

549
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:53,721
次は あずちゃん！
Next is, Azu-chan!

見逃すな ソワレ
Don't miss it, Soirée

552
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:02,721
僕ら目撃者だ
We are witnesses

553
00:51:02,821 --> 00:51:04,721
早急に手を伸ばした
I reached out quickly

554
00:51:04,821 --> 00:51:09,221
水平線が誰か照らしたって
Even if the horizon shines on someone...

555
00:51:09,421 --> 00:51:14,421
止めることなく君を繋ぐ架け橋渡ったら
If I cross the bridge that connects to you without stopping...

556
00:51:14,721 --> 00:51:17,221
いつの日か ソワレ
One day, Soirée

557
00:51:17,321 --> 00:51:19,421
君に届くまでさ
Until it reaches you

558
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:21,721
何度でも 呼び声を
Time and time again, the call

559
00:51:25,021 --> 00:51:29,221
消えない軌跡 辿って
Following the indelible trajectory

560
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:34,221
幾星霜の果て どこまでも
To the end of countless years, everywhere

561
00:51:46,721 --> 00:51:48,721
また抱いた ソワレ
I embraced it again, Soirée

562
00:51:48,821 --> 00:51:51,221
今だ寝息を立て
Still breathing softly in sleep

563
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:53,421
太陽の瞳を盗んで
Stealing the sun's eyes

564
00:51:53,521 --> 00:51:56,221
大胆さ さあ 逃げ出そうぜ
With boldness, come on, let's escape

565
00:51:56,721 --> 00:51:59,021
朝まで響け 空を
Resonate until morning through the sky

566
00:51:59,121 --> 00:52:03,021
跨ぐ栞を挟んだら
If I insert a bookmark that straddles...

567
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:05,221
約束だ ソワレ
It's a promise, Soirée

568
00:52:05,321 --> 00:52:07,521
僕が眠るまでは
Until I fall asleep

569
00:52:07,621 --> 00:52:09,721
何度でも また明日
Time and time again, see you tomorrow

570
00:52:16,021 --> 00:52:18,021
拝啓 ソワレ
Dear Soirée

571
00:52:18,121 --> 00:52:24,721
君へ読み継がれる僕たちの物語
Our story that will be read through to you

572
00:52:25,721 --> 00:52:27,221
次は すいちゃん！
Next is, Sui-chan!

573
00:52:29,221 --> 00:52:33,221
Step and Go!!

574
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,721
Step and Go!!

575
00:52:32,021 --> 00:52:34,221
Step and Go!!

576
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:38,221
Step and Go!!

577
00:52:45,021 --> 00:52:48,721
昨日から止まったような時計
A clock that seems to have stopped since yesterday

578
00:52:49,021 --> 00:52:53,221
幼い頃をふっと思い出した
I suddenly remembered my childhood

579
00:52:59,821 --> 00:53:03,721
もう心配しなくてもいいよ
You don't have to worry anymore

580
00:53:04,021 --> 00:53:08,721
あの優しい声がそばにあったから
Because that kind voice was by my side

581
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:19,221
恋に傷ついて道にも迷った日もあったけれど
There were days when I was hurt by love and lost my way

582
00:53:23,021 --> 00:53:28,721
いつだって探してたのは輝けるはずのBetter Day
What I was always looking for was a Better Day that should shine

583
00:53:29,021 --> 00:53:31,221
Everyday 解き放て
Everyday, set it free

584
00:53:32,721 --> 00:53:37,021
ためらわずそのエモーション
Without hesitation, that emotion

585
00:53:37,221 --> 00:53:42,221
時代のせいにしたってつまらないよ
It's boring to blame the times

586
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:47,721
Everyday 君であれ
Everyday, be yourself

587
00:53:48,021 --> 00:53:52,421
立ち止まる日もあるけれど
There are days when you stop in your tracks, but...

588
00:53:52,721 --> 00:53:55,421
ねえきっと君は大丈夫
Hey, I'm sure you'll be fine

589
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:58,721
Step and Go!!

590
00:53:59,721 --> 00:54:02,021
Step and Go!!

592
00:55:56,396 --> 00:56:02,786
お別れしたのはもっと前の事だったような
It feels like it's been even longer since we said goodbye

593
00:56:03,566 --> 00:56:10,206
哀しい光は封じ込めて 踵すり減らしたんだ
I sealed away that sad light and wore down my heels

594
00:56:11,366 --> 00:56:17,426
君といた時は見えた 今は見えなくなった
I could see it when I was with you, but now it's gone from my sight

595
00:56:18,396 --> 00:56:21,786
透明な彗星をぼんやりと
I was vacantly watching a transparent comet

596
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:24,826
でもそれだけ探している
But that's the only thing I'm looking for

597
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:28,386
しょっちゅう唄を歌ったよ
I sang songs all the time

598
00:56:28,786 --> 00:56:32,206
その時だけのメロディーを
Using the melody that existed only then

599
00:56:32,766 --> 00:56:36,226
寂しくなんかなかったよ
I wasn't lonely at all

600
00:56:36,366 --> 00:56:39,696
ちゃんと寂しくなれたから
Because I was able to properly feel lonely

601
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:43,586
いつまでどこまでなんて
How long, how far

602
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:47,096
正常か異常かなんて
Is it normal or abnormal?

603
00:56:47,496 --> 00:56:50,486
考える暇も無い程
So much that I don't even have time to think about it

604
00:56:50,566 --> 00:56:54,096
歩くのは大変だ
It's hard to keep walking

605
00:56:55,066 --> 00:56:58,296
楽しい方がずっといいよ
It's much better to have fun

606
00:56:58,366 --> 00:57:01,886
ごまかして笑っていくよ
I'll keep laughing and faking it

607
00:57:02,266 --> 00:57:05,496
大丈夫だ あの痛みは
It's okay, that pain...

608
00:57:05,566 --> 00:57:09,196
忘れたって消えやしない
won't disappear even if I forget it

609
00:57:09,696 --> 00:57:12,886
理想で作った道を
The path I made with ideals

610
00:57:12,966 --> 00:57:15,896
現実が塗り替えてゆくよ
Reality is painting over it

611
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:19,486
思い出はその軌跡の上で
Memories are on those tracks

612
00:57:19,566 --> 00:57:23,096
輝きになって残っている
Remaining as a sparkle

613
00:57:23,766 --> 00:57:27,186
お別れしたのは何で
Why did we say goodbye?

614
00:57:27,266 --> 00:57:30,696
何のためだったんだろうな
I wonder what it was all for

615
00:57:31,266 --> 00:57:34,196
哀しい光が僕の影を
The sad light casts my shadow...

616
00:57:34,266 --> 00:57:37,496
前に長く伸ばしている
long and ahead of me

617
00:57:38,266 --> 00:57:41,196
時々熱が出るよ
Sometimes I get a fever

618
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:44,496
時間がある時眠るよ
I sleep when I have time

619
00:57:45,266 --> 00:57:48,386
夢だと解るその中で
Inside a dream I know is a dream

620
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:52,596
君と会ってからまた行こう
After I meet you, I'll go again

621
00:57:53,196 --> 00:57:56,286
晴天とはほど遠い
It's far from a clear sky

622
00:57:56,366 --> 00:57:59,896
終わらない暗闇にも
Even in the endless darkness

623
00:58:00,266 --> 00:58:03,496
星を思い浮かべたなら
If I imagine the stars

624
00:58:03,566 --> 00:58:07,096
すぐ銀河の中だ
I'm immediately inside the galaxy

625
00:58:07,596 --> 00:58:10,886
あまり泣かなくなっても
Even if I don't cry as much

626
00:58:10,966 --> 00:58:14,296
靴を新しくしても
Even if I get new shoes

627
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:17,896
大丈夫だ あの痛みは
It's okay, that pain...

628
00:58:17,966 --> 00:58:21,396
忘れたって消えやしない
won't disappear even if I forget it

629
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:25,096
伝えたかった事が
The things I wanted to tell you...

630
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:28,296
きっとあったんだろうな
I'm sure there were some

631
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:32,396
恐らくありきたりなんだろうけど
They're probably commonplace

632
00:58:32,466 --> 00:58:35,896
こんなにも
But even so...

633
00:58:50,896 --> 00:58:53,586
お別れした事は
That we said goodbye

634
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:57,296
出会った事と繋がっている
Is connected to the fact that we met

635
00:58:57,896 --> 00:59:01,386
あの透明な彗星は
That transparent comet...

636
00:59:01,466 --> 00:59:05,096
透明だから無くならない
is transparent, so it never disappears

637
00:59:05,596 --> 00:59:08,786
〇✕△どれかなんて
Circles, crosses, triangles, which one?

638
00:59:08,866 --> 00:59:12,396
皆と比べてどうかだなんて
How does it compare to everyone else?

639
00:59:12,796 --> 00:59:15,786
確かめる間も無い程
So much that there's no time to check

640
00:59:15,866 --> 00:59:19,396
生きるのは最高だ
Being alive is the best

641
00:59:20,296 --> 00:59:23,386
あまり泣かなくなっても
Even if I don't cry as much

642
00:59:23,466 --> 00:59:26,896
ごまかして笑っていくよ
I'll keep laughing and faking it

643
00:59:27,296 --> 00:59:30,386
大丈夫だ あの痛みは
It's okay, that pain...

644
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:34,096
忘れたって消えやしない
won't disappear even if I forget it

645
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,886
大丈夫だ この光の
It's okay, at the beginning...

646
00:59:37,966 --> 00:59:41,596
始まりには
of this light...

647
00:59:41,696 --> 00:59:46,246
君がいる
you are there

648
01:00:32,771 --> 01:00:37,271
