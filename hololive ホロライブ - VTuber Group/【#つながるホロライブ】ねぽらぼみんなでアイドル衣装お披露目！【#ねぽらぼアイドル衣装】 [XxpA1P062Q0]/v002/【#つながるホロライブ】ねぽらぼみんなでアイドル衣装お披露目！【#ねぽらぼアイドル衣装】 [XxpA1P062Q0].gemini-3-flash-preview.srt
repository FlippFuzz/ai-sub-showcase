00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,400
おめでとうございました！凄かったね！
Congratulations! That was amazing!

23
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,600
どうでした？
How was it?

24
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,500
みんな、どうだった？
Everyone, what did you think?

25
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,500
あ、ね、コメント見る？コメント見る？
Ah, hey, should we check the comments? Check the comments?

26
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,800
全部で『良かった』って言ってるよ、絶対！
Everyone's definitely saying 'it was great'!

27
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
本当？
Really?

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,400
拍手だね、みんなね。拍手ばっかり！
It's all applause, everyone. Just applause!

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,000
拍手が多い！
Lots of clapping!

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
コメントが遅れてるのかな？拍手が多い…
Is the chat lagging? So many claps...

31
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,200
あ、良かったよ！最高だった！可愛かったって！
Ah, it's there! 'It was great!', 'The best!', 'So cute!'

32
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,800
本当？ありがとう！
Really? Thank you!

33
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,000
どう？なんかやっぱりリスナーの皆さん…
So? I wonder, for the listeners...

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
…どのアイドルタイプの服を着るかとか…
...what kind of idol outfit we'd wear...

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,500
そうそう、予想してたと思う。どうだった？予想とは。
Yeah, they were probably guessing. How was it compared to your guesses?

36
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,400
イメージとどう？当たったかな？
How's the image? Did anyone get it right?

37
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,700
当たってた？
Did you guess right?

38
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,200
ちなみに、ほら、色も同じなんじゃない？
By the way, look, aren't the colors the same?

39
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,500
あ、そうだよね！
Ah, you're right!

40
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,000
そう、この二人！この二人！
Yes, these two! These two!

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,400
ねっ、ねっこるじゃん！
See, it's 'Ne-Ko' (Nene-Polka)!

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,600
そうなの！
That's right!

43
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,500
しかも二人一緒に！
And the two of them together!

44
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,600
いや、抱きつくとか言うな！
Hey, don't say 'hugging'!

45
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,800
紐でしばらないで！
Don't tie us with a rope!

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,300
縛り付けて、無理やり連れてきてやったわ！
I tied her up and dragged her here by force!

47
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,000
すげえ。すげえな。
Amazing. That's something.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,600
ちなみにこれは先輩で言うとどの先輩と同じタイプなの、これは？
By the way, which senior's outfit is this the same type as?

49
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,800
自分は、まずは、そら先輩とお揃い！
For me, first of all, it matches Sora-senpai!

50
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,500
あー！ちょっとね、恐れ多いな、なんか。
Ah! It's a bit intimidating, somehow.

51
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,300
ポルカね！私は何だろう。あ、4期生で言うと…
Polka, right! For me, what is it? Ah, in the 4th Gen...

52
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,500
…かなたんとかが出てくるし…
...it's like Kanata-chan...

53
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,000
そうそう、このパンツのイメージすごい強いって言われない？
Yeah, don't people say this pants image is really strong?

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,400
はいはい、確かに！
Yes, true!

55
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,800
あと、AZKi先輩とかも、色違いで一緒だよね！
Also, AZKi-senpai has the same one but in a different color!

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
あー、なるほどね！
Ah, I see!

57
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,500
ししろんは？ししろんはどの先輩と同じタイプなのかな？
What about Shishiron? What senior type is Shishiron?

58
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,800
私は、ノエル先輩、マリン先輩…
I'm Noel-senpai, Marine-senpai...

59
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,500
…あとわためとスバル先輩！
...also Watame and Subaru-senpai!

60
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,200
あ、ししわたじゃん！
Ah, it's Shishi-Wata!

61
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,000
そう、ししわたこれよね！え、凄い凄い。ちょっと両手上げて欲しいな。
Yeah, this is Shishi-Wata! Hey, amazing. I want you to lift both arms.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,400
何で？
Why?

63
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,400
最高だよ！あとね、チョコ先生ともお揃いだけな、これ凄い！
It's the best! Also, it matches Choco-sensei! This is great!

64
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,100
何でそれ両手上げさせた？
Why did you make me lift both arms?

65
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,500
あれなんだよね、比較的、お胸の大きい先輩たちが着てるタイプの…
It's that type that, relatively, seniors with large chests wear...

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,700
…衣装の形なんだよね！
...that costume shape!

67
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,800
ワッショイしてるだけ！いやいいぞ！おへそと脇を同時に鑑賞できるな、素晴らしい！
It's a celebration! No, this is good! We can admire the navel and armpits at the same time, wonderful!

68
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,400
ししろん今日テンション高いね！
Shishiron, you're so energetic today!

69
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,800
いや、嬉しいじゃん！
I mean, I'm happy!

70
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,000
なんかね、ねぽらぼで揃ってアイドル衣装はやっぱ嬉しいじゃん！
Having matching idol outfits with NePoLaBo is really happy, after all!

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
乗り遅れに感動してたのに、今ししろ見て、俺全然違うわ！はーい！
I was moved by her getting on board, but now looking at Shishiro, it's totally different! Hi!

72
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
じゃあ、ラミィちゃんは？
So, how about Lamy-chan?

73
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,300
ラミィはね、みこ先輩とかはあちゃまとか、ころね先輩とかぺこら先輩とか…
Lamy is Miko-senpai, Haachama, Korone-senpai, Pekora-senpai...

74
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,000
…と同じタイプのかたちになってます！
...the same type of shape as them!

75
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,300
いいぞ！飛び跳ねて欲しい！飛び跳ねて欲しい！
Nice! I want you to jump! I want you to jump!

76
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,400
何で？さっきもやってたじゃん、そのくだり！
Why? We just did that whole routine!

77
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,000
マリン先輩と同じこと言ってんじゃん！
You're saying the same thing as Marine-senpai!

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,500
いや、何回見てもいい！もっともっと飛んで欲しい！
No, it's good no matter how many times I see it! I want you to jump more and more!

79
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
何で？自分が見たいだけだろ！ちょっと！
Why? You just want to see it yourself! Hey!

80
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,500
飛ぶね、飛ぶね、飛ぶ！
She's jumping, she's jumping, jump!

81
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,000
ねえ！やめて！
Hey! Stop it!

82
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,333
ししろ先輩！ねぇねぇ！
Shishiro-senpai! Hey, hey!

83
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:06,533
ほら！君あんなに「アイドル衣装が～」とかって昨日配信してたのに、これでもう...
Look! You were streaming yesterday like "Idol outfits are...", and now already...

84
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:09,933
もうはやだよ！あ、でもね、本当にね、あのほら...
It's already over! Ah, but really, you know, like...

85
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:12,833
お披露目の、あのサイン書くやつ！
The reveal, that part where we wrote our signatures!

86
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,833
え、すごかったよね！画面に書いてたんでしょ？
Eh, it was amazing, wasn't it! You were writing on the screen, right?

87
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,433
とってもね、ねねがね、自分に...
Very much, Nene, for herself...

88
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:21,833
あの都合のいい向きで書いてたからね、みんなには...
She wrote it in a direction convenient for her, so for everyone...

89
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,833
逆向きで見えてたっていうハプニングね！
it appeared backwards - what a mishap!

90
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:28,433
結構さ、今日何やるかってさ、お互い言わなかったじゃん？
Actually, we didn't tell each other what we were doing today, did we?

91
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:29,433
あ、そうだね！
Ah, that's right!

92
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:31,933
だから、さっき、えっ！
So, just now, I was like "Eh!"

93
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:33,933
え、でもいっぱい出しちゃったけど...
Eh, but we put out so much...

94
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,433
え、でもそれはそれで、なんか味があるっていうか...
Eh, but that has its own charm, or rather...

95
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:41,433
私たちらしくて良かった！あ、すごい良かった！
It was very "us", which was good! Ah, it was great!

96
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:45,333
まあ良かった。いいなと思った。なんかすごい演出が斬新だった。そうだね。
Well, it was good. I liked it. The production was really novel. True.

97
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:47,333
ね、初めてのことながら。
Yeah, for a first time.

98
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:49,433
いや～、揃ったね！揃った！
Wow, we're all together! Together!

99
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:52,433
ね、あとおまるんのね、ねねを最初に...
Yeah, and Omarun, Nene at the start...

100
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:54,933
あの、倒して... あ、そうだわ！
um, taking her down... Ah, that's right!

101
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:59,933
あの、ファンタジーゲームね！そう、ファンタジーゲーム始まりました。
That fantasy game! Yeah, the fantasy game began.

102
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:02,433
ポルカ先輩っていうのが良かったね。
That "Polka-senpai" bit was good.

103
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:05,933
でもファンタジーゲームのナレーションやってる人かと思ったわ、私。
But I thought it was someone doing narration for a fantasy game.

104
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,433
ゲーム始まっちゃうよ！
The game's starting!

105
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:10,433
今回もご協力いただきありがとうございます。
Thank you for your cooperation this time as well.

106
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:14,933
目覚めたらアイドルだったね、ね。そう、目覚めたら、ここはステージっていうのがね。
When I woke up, I was an idol, right? Yeah, "When I woke up, this was the stage."

107
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:17,933
アイドルだから毒リンゴ効かんかったわ、っていうやつでしょ？
Since I'm an idol, the poison apple didn't work - that's the one, right?

108
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,933
そうそう。でも、VTuberだから毒リンゴは効かないですよね（笑）みたいな。
Right, right. But like, "Since I'm a VTuber, poison apples don't work, right? (laughs)".

109
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:23,933
確かに効かないね。
True, they don't work.

110
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,933
へ～。そっか。
Heh~. I see.

111
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:31,933
何？「へ～」じゃないんだわ。何これ。
What? Don't just say "Heh~". What is this?

112
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:38,433
ラミィがさ、なんか、あの着替えたのめちゃくちゃさ、綺麗だったね、ターン。ね、ターン！
Lamy, that part where she changed, her turn was incredibly beautiful. Yeah, the turn!

113
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,433
ひゅん！って. これこれこれこれ！
Hyun! This, this, this, this!

114
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:43,433
また謎技術が使われてたわ。
Yet another mysterious technology was used.

115
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:47,933
いや、後ろのリボン本当可愛い！可愛い！見て、後ろ見て！
The ribbon on the back is truly cute! Cute! Look, look at the back!

116
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,933
あ、後ろ見てもらおう。
Ah, let's show the back.

117
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,933
ほら、みんな、みんな後ろ向いてほら！
Look, everyone, everyone turn around!

118
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:56,933
じゃ～ん！ポルカとラミィのが逆になってんの。
Ta-da! Polka and Lamy's are reversed.

119
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:58,933
そう、色反転してんの。
Yeah, the colors are inverted.

120
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:00,433
そうでよ。
That's right.

121
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:03,933
ちょ、もうちょっと引きで、引きで撮ってください。引きで！
Wait, please take a wider shot. Wide shot!

122
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:06,433
イエーイ！自分でそれを言うのめちゃくちゃ面白い。
Yay! It's so funny saying that ourselves.

123
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:10,933
さあ、今日みんなテンション高いな。高い。いや、そりゃそうでしょ！
Boy, everyone's energy is high today. High. Well, of course it is!

124
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:12,933
そうだよ。高いです。
Exactly. It is high.

125
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,433
まずいな。でね、あと最後のししろんだよ。ありがとな。
Uh oh. And then, there's Shishiron at the end. Thanks.

126
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:20,933
最高だったよね！もう、うん、もうちょっとなんかね... 羽ばたいちゃった。
It was the best! Like, yeah, a little bit... I kind of took flight.

127
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:22,933
羽ばたいちゃった。でも空気！あれ空気だよね？
Took flight. But the air! That was air, right?

128
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:25,433
空気！すごかった！
Air! It was amazing!

129
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,933
マシュマロが中に入った空気、ちゃんと...
Air that had marshmallows inside, properly...

130
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:30,933
ちゃんと作りました！ふわふわ、ちゃんと自分で作りました。
I made it properly! It's fluffy, I made it myself.

131
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,933
いや本当にすごかった！めっちゃ可愛かった。
No, it was really incredible! So cute.

132
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:36,933
SSRBまさか焼かれると思わなかった。
I never thought SSRB would get burned.

133
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:39,933
思わなかった。でもいつも投げられたり、投げられたり...
Me neither. But they're always being thrown, thrown...

134
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:43,433
爆発してんのに、さらに焼かれるんだ、っていう。
They're already exploding, and now they're getting burned too.

135
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:48,433
あ、俺が焼かれ続けて。それでさ、100万人記念おめでとうございます！おめでとう！
Ah, I'll just keep being burned. Also, congratulations on 1 million subscribers! Congratulations!

136
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:51,433
あれ、全然知らなかったから、そうなんですよ。
That, I didn't know about it at all, so yeah.

137
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:55,933
え、超良いじゃん！と思って。まあ良かった。ぜひ後でチェックしてください。はーい！そっちも大チェック！
Eh, I thought it was super cool. Well, it was good. Please check it out later. Okay! Check that out too!

138
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:58,933
じゃあ、どうする？え、何がどうするの？
So, what should we do? Eh, what do you mean what should we do?

139
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:03,933
あとね、見て見て、ねねさ、オレンジかと思いきやピンクなの、ちょっと。あ、アピール入りました。
And look, look, Nene's... I thought it was orange but it's actually pink. Ah, she's showing off.

140
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:06,433
ねねのこの色って何色になるの？
What color would you call this of Nene's?

141
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,933
結構、ほら見て、足！足！そういえばみんな足も...
Quite... look, look, legs! Legs! Come to think of it, everyone's legs too...

142
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:14,433
足もほら！私の足ほら！いつもの。ほら良いよね、それ。
Legs too, look! Look at my legs! The usual. Look, that's good.

143
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,433
私はトランプの柄。
I have a playing card pattern.

144
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,433
ねねはね、桃の花と桃。
Nene has peach blossoms and peaches.

145
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:21,933
いいね、みんな結構、ほら、みんならしい感じで。違うんだよ。
Nice, everyone's got their own style. They're all different.

146
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:25,433
あ、で、服によって、こっちにさ、ついてるのも違うよね、確か。
Ah, and depending on the outfit, the side this is on is different too, I think.

147
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,933
私こっち。ラミィちゃんと一緒？
Mine's here. Same as Lamy-chan?

148
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:29,433
そうそうそう。ラミィと一緒。
Yes, yes, yes. Same as Lamy.

149
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:33,433
へ～、そうなんだ。おお、本当だ。ね、うちらこっちだもんね。一緒、一緒。
Heh~, I see. Oh, you're right. Yeah, ours is on this side. Same, same.

150
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:37,933
え、そこの太もものそこだけついてるの、ヤバいな。ちょ。
Eh, it's crazy how it's only attached to that part of the thigh. Wait.

151
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:42,433
いいじゃん、いいじゃん！特別に、ちょっと見ていいよ、ほら。ラミィ、ラミィ、ラミィ！
It's fine, it's fine! I'll let you take a special look, here. Lamy, Lamy, Lamy!

152
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:43,933
え、ちょっと何、何？
Eh, wait, what, what?

153
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:46,933
ねねも、ねね！ちょ、違うんだよな、それ。
Nene too, Nene! Wait, that's not right.

154
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:48,933
何それ、ロデオしてんの、な。
What is that, are you doing a rodeo?

155
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,933
これ絶対違うだろ、それは。
That's definitely wrong.

156
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,433
あ、腕についてるのもいいな、ししろん。
Ah, the one on the arm is nice too, Shishiron.

157
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:58,933
腕は先輩みんなついてるんじゃないかな。
I think all the senpais have it on their arms.

158
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,933
あ、お揃いじゃないか、これ。
Ah, isn't this matching?

159
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:06,433
でね、耳がね、あれなんだよね。リボン！リボン！めっちゃ可愛い！そう、耳。
And the ears, you know. Ribbon! Ribbon! So cute! Yeah, the ears.

160
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:09,433
え、耳、ぴこぴこ。ぴこぴこもだけどさ、このリボンがええやんな。
Eh, ears, twitching. The twitching is one thing, but this ribbon is great, isn't it.

161
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:14,433
そうなの。ね、ネックレスにもお揃いで。いいな。
That's right. And there's a matching one on the necklace. Nice.

162
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:21,933
あ、ていうかさ、なんか、そうやって見るとししろ本当にロリだな、やっぱり。嘘やん。
Ah, come to think of it, seeing you like that, Shishiro really is a loli after all. No way.

163
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:26,433
結構、Twitterとか見てても、ロリっていう... いつもほら、かっこいいからさ、衣装が。
Quite a lot on Twitter, the "loli" thing... Because usually, you see, her outfits are cool.

164
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:31,933
だから、今日このアイドル衣装を着た感じ、どんな感じになるのかすごい楽しみにしてるリスナーさんいっぱいいたけど。
So, there were lots of listeners really looking forward to seeing how she'd look in this idol outfit today.

165
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:40,933
みんな、どうだったかな。ね、どうですか。感想またちょっとね、#ねぽらぼアイドル衣装 で、呟いてほしい。どうしたの？
Everyone, how was it? Well, what do you think? I want you to tweet your impressions with #NepolaboIdolOutfit. What happened?

166
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:44,933
どうしたの？もうなんか、集中切れちゃった？
What's wrong? Did you lose your concentration already?

167
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:48,933
集中切れちゃったのかな。さ、みんな、ちょっと、みんな今日ちょっと落ち着きない。
Maybe she lost her concentration. Now, everyone, a bit... everyone's a bit restless today.

168
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:53,933
だって嬉しいんだもん。着れてさ。イエーイ！
But we're happy. To be able to wear this. Yay!

169
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:59,933
フラメンコ！やめなさい、やめなさい。はあ、あっち。
Flamenco! Stop it, stop it. Phew, look over there.

170
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,420
ねえ、撮影とかしよっか。
Hey, shall we take some photos?

171
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,220
撮影会する！
Let's have a photo session!

172
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,545
誰か撮りたい人とかおる？
Is there anyone who wants to take them?

173
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:04,470
え、ねね持ちたい！
Oh, Nene wants to hold it!

174
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,220
持ちたい！
I want to hold it!

175
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,220
本当、おたまりやな。
You're really eager, aren't you?

176
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,970
じゃ、ねねがカメラ持って、みんなのこと撮ってみましょうか。
Then Nene will take the camera and try taking photos of everyone.

177
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:10,595
任せた！
We're counting on you!

178
00:10:10,595 --> 00:10:11,495
いいよ。
Sure.

179
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:12,495
どんなふうに撮ってくれるの？
How are you going to take them?

180
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:14,420
ねね、なんかコメントも拾ってみようかな、なんかあったら。
Nene, I think I'll try picking up some comments too, if there are any.

181
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,270
あ、そう。
Ah, okay.

182
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,170
なんかあったら。
If there's anything.

183
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:16,970
どんなのがいい？
What kind would be good?

184
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,470
でもみんな可愛いしか言わない。
But everyone will only say "cute".

185
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,470
お、獅白のおへそ！
Oh, Shishiro's belly button!

186
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,720
うわ！ちょっと待って！やめて、そういうの！
Whoa! Wait a minute! Stop that kind of thing!

187
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,920
おいおいおい！
Hey, hey, hey!

188
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,820
欲望に忠実かよ！
You're so true to your desires!

189
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,120
獅白ガール！
Shishiro Girl!

190
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,420

あ、いいね、この横。
Ah, nice, this side view.

195
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,470

A little more... Miss Lamy, a little more this way.

196
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,170
もうちょっと、お尻ぷりっと突き出して。
Stick your butt out a little more.

197
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,370
え、ちょっと！
Wait, what?!

198
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,120
お前、ちょっとカメラもうちょっと頑張れよ。
Hey, you, try a bit harder with the camera.

199
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,020
ダメ出しされてんじゃねえかよ。
You're being criticized, aren't you?

200
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,020
ちょっとねね！
Wait, Nene!

201
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,920
どうですか？
How's this?

202
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,120
画角、そうそうそう！そう！
The angle, yes, yes, yes! Like that!

203
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,270
もっと下からでもいいよ！
Even from lower down is fine!

204
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,470
あ、いいねいいね、撮っぴー！
Ah, nice, nice. Click!

205
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,320

Yo, you're like a troublesome fan!

206
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,370
違う違う違う！
No, no, no!

207
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,470
それ以上アイドルラインを超えないでっていう話！
I'm saying don't cross the idol line any further!

208
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,720
あ、そうだね。
Ah, that's right.

209
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,870
アイドルラインがあったか、一応。
There was an idol line, technically.

210
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,220
え、これすごい楽しいな、何これ！
Eh, this is so much fun, what's this!

ポルカサンドする？
A Polka sandwich?

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,170
おまる、おまる、厚みが。

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,170
厚みが。
The thickness.

219
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,170

There isn't any?

220
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,970
厚みがあんまりない！
There isn't much thickness!

221
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,420
何の厚みなんだよ！
Thickness of what?!

What happened? Are you okay?

234
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,120

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,670
あ、背中合わせとかどう？
Ah, how about back-to-back?

250
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,920
背中合わせ、いいな。
Back-to-back, that's good.

251
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,970

Ah, ah, ah, nice, nice!

257
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,720
これ横にしたらめちゃくちゃいい画角になる。
If you turn this horizontally, it'll be a great angle.

258
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,370
ちょっとちょっと、ふいふいさせない！
Wait, wait, don't let it sway!

259
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,970
ふいふいふい。
Sway, sway, sway.

260
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,220

Isn't it good!

264
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,170
いいね！
Nice!

265
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,470

Taking photos is fun.

266
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,420
え、すごい可愛い。
Wow, so cute.

267
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,670
どうする、他に誰か持つ？
What should we do? Will anyone else hold it?

268
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,470
持ちたい人いる？
Is there anyone who wants to hold it?

269
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,020
え、なんか怖い。
Oh, I'm kind of nervous.

270
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,170
ドキドキしちゃう。
My heart is pounding.

271
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,020
じゃ、ラミも持ちたいよ。
Then, Lamy wants to hold it too.

272
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,920
え、何撮る？
Eh, what will you take?

273
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
ラミちゃん持つ？
Will Lamy-chan hold it?

274
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,620
あ、いいよ。
Ah, sure.

275
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,920
ラミちゃん持つ？
Will Lamy-chan hold it?

276
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,920
え、次は...
Eh, next is...

277
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,120
次はそうだね。
Next is, that's right.

278
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,270
次はお持ちや。
Next is holding it.

279
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,420
おっしゃ、じゃあちょっと3人並んでもらって。
Alright, then could you three line up for a bit?

280
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,420
はーい。
Oka~y.

281
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,420
あ、いいね、可愛い！
Ah, nice, cute!

282
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,920
あ、ちょっと逆がいいわ、逆。
Ah, wait, the opposite side would be better.

283
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
逆？
Opposite?

284
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
こっち、こっち、こっち。
This way, this way, this way.

285
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
あ、客席側！
Ah, the audience side!

286
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,120
なるほどね。
I see.

287
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,270
ヤッホー！
Yahoo!

288
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,420
はい、もっとギュッとしてギュッとして集まって！
Okay, get closer together, closer together!

289
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,420
イエーイ！
Yay!

290
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,120
あ、いいね、可愛い！
Ah, nice, cute!

291
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,520
あ、あ、あ、あ！
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

292
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,220
イエーイ！
Yay!

293
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,120
あ、イエーイ、いいね！
Ah, yay, nice!

294
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,270
あ、いいね、いいね。
Ah, nice, nice.

295
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,720
ちょっとね。
Just a bit.

296
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,220
イエーイ、お願いします。
Yay, please.

297
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,020
なんかソーシャルディスタンス。
Kind of like social distance.

298
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,520
ソーシャルディスタンスしてみて。
Try doing social distance.

299
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
中継に映ってきた人みたいになってる。
You look like people appearing in a live broadcast.

300
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,020
天気予報とかの後ろにいる人のやつだ。
It's like the people standing behind a weather report.

301
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,970
オッケーです。
Okay, that's good.

302
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,520
はい、可愛いですね。
Yes, you're cute.

303
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,870
さ、最後、ほらポルカも。
Now, lastly, look, Polka too.

304
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,020
ていうかさ、こんなんコメントするほうもさ。
By the way, for people commenting on this...

305
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,470
可愛いしか言えなくない？
Can they really say anything besides "cute"?

306
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,520
確かに思った。
I thought so too.

307
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,120
可愛いんだもん。
Because you're cute.

308
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,520
邪気ん、ポルカカメラ！
Shing! Polka camera!

309
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,420
ラミだ。
It's Lamy.

310
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,620
あれ、ラミだ。
Oh, it's Lamy.

311
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,620
あ、ししらみを撮る際は、ですね。
Ah, when taking photos of Shishi-Lami...

312
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,520
あ、いいね、ししらみを撮る際は。
Ah, nice, when taking photos of Shishi-Lami...

313
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,320
やっぱりさっきの斜め角度がマストなんですけど。
...that diagonal angle from earlier is a must.

314
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,420
ねえちゃんもおいで。
Nene-chan, you come too.

315
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,420
おいで。
Come here.

316
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,470
あれ、なんかいる。
Oh, someone's here.

317
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,470
ねえちゃんもおいで。
Nene-chan, you come too.

318
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,020
こういう感じっすね。
It's like this.

319
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,470
で、目線こっちください。
And please look this way.

320
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,420
はーい。
Oka~y.

321
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,970
で、あ、ね、ねねのポーズ、ちょっと何か何、しとやか。
And... oh, Nene's pose is a bit... what, graceful?

322
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,420
いつもと違う。
It's different from usual.

323
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,470
どういうこと？
What do you mean?

324
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,120
俺が多分斜めに撮るっていう確信して可愛い感じ。
You're probably confident that I'll take it diagonally and look cute.

325
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,420
あ、いいね、いいやん！
Ah, nice, that's good!

326
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,520
可愛いよ、いただきました、ありがとうございます。
You're cute. Got the shot, thank you.

327
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,020
ワーオ！
Wow!

328
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,520
すごいワーオ！
So wow!

329
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,620
プロだなあ。
Such a pro.

330
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,720
ローアングラーになっちゃった。
I've become a low-angle photographer.

331
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,920
やば。
Whoa.

332
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,520
腹筋ハンパな。
Your abs are incredible.

333
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,120
ねね、ほら、一番可愛いポーズ。
Nene, come on, your cutest pose.

334
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,520
はい！
Yes!

335
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,620
え、え、え？
Eh, eh, eh?

336
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,620
ファンサービスポーズ。
Fan service pose.

337
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,920
はい、イエーイ！
Yes, yay!

338
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
やめなさい。
Stop that.

339
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,020
なんかさ、ポルカさ。
You know, Polka...

340
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,520
ポルカさ、アイドルポーズができなかったから、ねねに教わろうと思ったけど、やめたわ。
Polka couldn't do an idol pose, so I thought I'd learn from Nene, but I changed my mind.

341
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,020
あ、ほんと。
Oh, really.

342
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,620
ラミ、アイドルポーズ。
Lamy, idol pose.

343
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,120
ほー！
Whoa!

344
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,520
美し獅白も並んで、ちょっとアイドルポーズのお手本見せて。
Beautiful Shishiro, line up too, and show us a model idol pose.

345
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,120
いいよ。
Sure.

346
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,620
今ねねが真ん中で謎のポーズしてる。
Now Nene is in the middle doing a mysterious pose.

347
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,920
え、え？
Eh, eh?

348
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,120
何だ、ねね。
What is it, Nene?

349
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,520
ねね教えて。
Tell us, Nene.

350
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
なに、そのねねのポーズは。
What's with that pose, Nene?

351
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,020
え、これっぽいでしょ、これっぽい。
Eh, it's like this, right? Like this.

352
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,520
こういうやつ。
This kind of thing.

353
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,120
あ、すごい、すごい！
Ah, amazing, amazing!

354
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,520
あ、いい、可愛い、これ！
Ah, nice, this is cute!

355
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,420
いいもみしだぽあ。
Nice Momishida-poa.

356
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,920
いただきました、はい、可愛い。
Got it, yes, cute.

357
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,520
ありがとう！
Thank you!

358
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,120
ありがとう。
Thank you.

359
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,520
わかった。
Got it.

360
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,920
ラミの何、何だっけ。
Lamy's... what was it?

361
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,120
ちょっと4人でさ、やりたいな、ちょっと。
I want to do something with the four of us, just for a bit.

362
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,020
ラミの何、今のアイドルポーズ、せっかくだから。
Lamy's... since we're here, that idol pose from just now.

363
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,520
いいよ。
Sure.

364
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,120
こっちから行くの？
Are we going from this way?

365
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,920
ポルカ、ポルカ、ほらこっち、真ん中おいで、こっち。
Polka, Polka, look, this way, come to the middle, this way.

366
00:15:01,457 --> 00:15:03,257
はい、なんか、ほら、ちょっとアイドルポーズしな、ほら。
Okay, come on, do some idol poses!

367
00:15:03,557 --> 00:15:05,557
えっと、真ん中ら辺の人ってないですよね。
Um, the people in the middle don't have one, do they?

368
00:15:06,857 --> 00:15:09,657
何してんの、お前らも、なんか、こういう原始的な感じがいいんじゃない？
What are you doing? Wouldn't something primitive like this be good?

369
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:10,857
原始的？
Primitive?

370
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:12,557
グー？いいわね、いいわね。あ、いいわね。
A fist? Nice, nice! Oh, that's good.

371
00:15:12,857 --> 00:15:14,557
あ、でもさ、よくお前らこうやってやってんじゃん。
But you guys usually do this, don't you?

372
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:16,557
うん、でも真ん中だからさ。
Yeah, but since we're in the middle...

373
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:18,057
え、じゃあ端っこ行こうか。
Then let's go to the ends.

374
00:15:18,257 --> 00:15:19,457
あ、やったー！
Oh, yay!

375
00:15:20,057 --> 00:15:22,057
そっちのけでしてる、今。めっちゃ背伸びしてる。
They're totally ignoring us. They're really stretching.

376
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:23,557
こういう感じ？
Like this?

377
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,057
はっ！はっ！
Hah! Hah!

378
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:30,057
おいしょ！おいしょ！よしよしよし！よしよし！よしよし！
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Good, good, good! Nice, nice!

379
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,257
ポルカ、大丈夫？
Polka, are you okay?

380
00:15:33,857 --> 00:15:35,557
何でそんな苦しそうなの？
Why do you look like you're in pain?

381
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:37,057
いや、分からん。
I don't even know.

382
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:39,057
ちょっと、何やってんだよ！
Hey, what are you doing!

383
00:15:39,557 --> 00:15:41,057
え、なんだかんだで、でも、もうあれじゃね？
Wait, after all that, isn't it time?

384
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:42,557
え？あ、というわけで、ほら。
Eh? Oh, speaking of which, look.

385
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:45,557
もうそろそろね、私たちが集まった理由もあるでしょうに。
It's about time, there's a reason we all gathered here.

386
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:46,857
あ、そうですねー！
Ah, that's right!

387
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:49,057
この時間は一旦終わりです。
This segment is over for now.

388
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:52,057
えー！寂しいー！寂しい！

00:16:00,557 --> 00:16:01,857
