00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:03,356
かさぶたに変わって 剥がれ落ちるだろうか
turn into scabs and peel away?

110
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:08,556
いつまでも相変わらず つまらない話を
Always the same as ever, looking for happiness

In the end, no one will tell me

118
00:12:50,856 --> 00:12:54,656
教えてはくれないんだ 進むべき道なんて
the path I should take

119
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:59,556

煌めきを探せよ
Search for the sparkle

124
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:20,656

00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:22,556
大事なものは貴方だって
never realizing that you

126
00:13:22,556 --> 00:13:24,556
ことに気づけないままで
are what's most important

127
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:29,356
一体未来はどうなるのかなんてことより
Rather than what the future will hold,

128
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:31,556
毒めく今の煌めきに
I hope I can notice the toxic

129
00:13:31,556 --> 00:13:33,556
気づけたらいいんだ
sparkle of the present

142
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:02,471
何着りゃいいんだろ
What should I wear?

143
00:15:02,471 --> 00:15:03,571
春と秋
Spring and autumn

144
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:04,771
どこいっちゃったんだよ
Where did they go?

145
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,571
息も出来ない　情報の圧力
Can't even breathe, the pressure of information

146
00:15:07,571 --> 00:15:10,171
めまいの螺旋だ　わたしはどこにいる
A spiral of dizziness, where am I?

147
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:15,771
こんなに　こんなに　息の音がするのに
Even though I can hear my own breathing so clearly

148
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:20,571
変だね　世界の音がしない
It's strange, I can't hear the sounds of the world

149
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:23,771
足りない　足りない　誰にも気づかれない
Not enough, not enough, no one notices me

150
00:15:23,771 --> 00:15:28,471
殴り書きみたいな音　出せない状態で叫んだよ
Screaming in a state where I can't make a sound like a scribble

151
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:34,071
「ありのまま」なんて誰に見せるんだ
Who would I show "my true self" to?

152
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:38,671
馬鹿なわたしは歌うだけ
Stupid me, I just sing

153
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,471
ぶちまけちゃおうか　星に
Shall I pour it all out to the stars?

154
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:03,471
エリクサーに張り替える作業も　なんとなくなんだ
The task of changing to Elixir strings is just kind of whatever

155
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:07,871
欠けた爪を少し触る
I touch my chipped fingernail a bit

156
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:12,871
半径300mmの体で必死に鳴いてる
Desperately crying out with a body of 300mm radius

157
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:17,871
音楽にとってココが地球だな
For music, this is Earth

158
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:21,271
空気を握って　空を殴るよ
I grip the air and punch the sky

159
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,871
何にも起きない　わたしは無力さ
Nothing happens, I'm powerless

160
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:28,671
だけどさ　その手で　この鉄を弾いたら
But if I pluck these steel strings with those hands

161
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:33,871
何かが変わって見えたような
It felt like something changed

162
00:16:33,871 --> 00:16:38,471
眩しい　眩しい　そんなに光るなよ
Dazzling, dazzling, don't shine so brightly

163
00:16:38,471 --> 00:16:43,471
わたしのダサい影がより色濃くなってしまうだろ
My uncool shadow will only become more distinct

164
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:48,471
なんでこんなに熱くなっちゃって止まんない
Why did it get so hot and won't stop?

165
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:53,471
馬鹿なわたしは歌うだけ
Stupid me, I just sing

166
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,271
うるさいんだって心臓
My heart is so loud

167
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:17,071
蒼い惑星　ひとりぼっち　いっぱいの音を聞いてきた
Blue planet, all alone, I've heard so many sounds

168
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:22,271
回り続けて幾億年　一瞬でもいいから...
Revolving for billions of years, even for a moment...

169
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:26,671
ああ　聴いて　聴けよ
Ah, listen, listen to me!

170
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:32,671
わたし　わたし　わたしはここにいる
I, I, I am right here

171
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:37,671
殴り書きみたいな音　出せない状態で叫んだよ
Screaming in a state where I can't make a sound like a scribble

172
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:42,671
なりたい　なりたい　何者かでいい
I want to be, I want to be, someone, anyone

173
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:47,671
馬鹿なわたしは歌うだけ
Stupid me, I just sing

174
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:51,471
ぶちまけちゃおうか　星に
Shall I pour it all out to the stars?

175
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:49,271
とおい　とおい　むかしばなし
A long, long time ago story

176
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:54,671
それはきっと　あすのはなし
That is surely a story of tomorrow

177
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:05,071
片羽 / 歌：天音かなた
One Wing / Vocals: Amane Kanata

178
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:04,671
“もう　飛べやしないさ”
"I can't fly anymore"

179
00:19:04,671 --> 00:19:09,671
落ち続ける夜から醒めた
I woke up from the night of continuous falling

180
00:19:09,671 --> 00:19:15,671
白い部屋の片隅で
In a corner of a white room

181
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:20,671
彷徨ってる　自由をなくして
Wandering around, having lost my freedom

182
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:26,471
塞ぐ　倒れ込んだまま
Shutting myself in, having collapsed

183
00:19:26,471 --> 00:19:30,471
ああ　細い片翼が
Ah, a thin single wing...

184
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:33,471
ああ　ないんだ
Ah, ...is gone

185
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:37,871
叫んだ　心が止まらなくて
I screamed, my heart wouldn't stop

186
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:42,871
機械みたいに　きしむ僕を　現実が嗤った
Reality sneered at me as I creaked like a machine

187
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:49,271
その時　誰かが囁いたんだ
At that moment, someone whispered

188
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:59,071
「あなたに　あげた　つばさ」
"The wings I gave you"

189
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:01,529
「あなたに　あげた　つばさ」
“The wings I gave to you”

190
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:04,465
「わたしの　ゆめみた　せかい」
“The world that I dreamed of”

191
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:06,700
羽ばたきたい
I want to spread my wings

192
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,305
大空へ
Into the vast sky

193
00:20:11,305 --> 00:20:16,944
嗚呼 風鳴く
Ah, the wind wails

194
00:20:16,944 --> 00:20:22,149
止まらないで 高く高く
Don't stop, higher and higher

195
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:27,854
幾度夢みた 祈った 雲の果て
How many times I've dreamed and prayed, beyond the clouds

196
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:33,493
終わりを越えて 高く高く
Beyond the end, higher and higher

197
00:20:33,493 --> 00:20:40,567
かけがえのない ガラクタの羽で
With these irreplaceable, junk-like wings

198
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:48,441
“星を見失った”
“I've lost sight of the stars”

199
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:53,480
紛れ住む 人間のセカイ
Living hidden in the human world

200
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,718
一つの羽じゃ飛べない
I can't fly with just one wing

201
00:20:57,718 --> 00:21:00,087
もう飛びたくない
I don't want to fly anymore

202
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:05,192
色彩の 半分だけで
With only half of the colors

203
00:21:05,192 --> 00:21:10,630
底を這うこともできなかった
I couldn't even crawl along the bottom

204
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:16,269
「わたしには もう いらないの」
“I don't need it anymore”

205
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:21,908
かわりに ひかりは きみがみてよ
Instead, you look at the light

206
00:21:21,908 --> 00:21:27,547
苛立つほどに 青かった エデンで泣いてた
Crying in Eden, which was so blue it was irritating

207
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:33,753
その時 掴んでくれた 誰かの手
That's when someone's hand grabbed mine

208
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:39,092
嗚呼
Ah

209
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:44,331
あなたがくれた 希望で
With the hope you gave me

210
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:49,169
約束の羽で今
With the promised wings, now

211
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:51,105
飛ぶなくちゃ
I have to fly

212
00:21:51,105 --> 00:21:56,677
共に往く
Let's go together

213
00:21:56,677 --> 00:22:01,415
地平の先へ
Beyond the horizon

214
00:22:01,415 --> 00:22:06,420
壊れるまで 高く高く
Until I break, higher and higher

215
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:11,926
今の僕は 片羽でいい
I'm fine with being single-winged for now

216
00:22:11,926 --> 00:22:14,528
飛べるよ 信じて
I can fly, believe me

217
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,830
飛べるよ その先へ
I can fly, towards the future

218
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,433
飛べるよ 楽園
I can fly, to paradise

219
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:24,638
永遠の彼方まで
To the far reaches of eternity

220
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:37,585
嗚呼
Ah

221
00:22:37,585 --> 00:22:46,087
遥か 彼方まで
Far, far away

222
00:23:05,205 --> 00:23:08,609
君をのせて
Carrying You

223
00:23:15,616 --> 00:23:20,287
あの地平線
That horizon

224
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:24,791
輝くのは
Shining

225
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:32,499
どこかに君を かくしているから
Is because you're hidden somewhere

226
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:37,304
たくさんの灯が
The many lights

227
00:23:37,304 --> 00:23:41,108
なつかしいのは
Make me feel nostalgic

228
00:23:41,108 --> 00:23:48,915
あのどれかひとつに 君がいるから
Because you are in one of them

229
00:23:48,915 --> 00:23:53,020
さあ でかけよう
Now, let's set out

230
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,224
ひときれのパン
A piece of bread

231
00:23:57,224 --> 00:24:06,500
ナイフ、ランプ、かばんに つめこんで
Knife, lamp, packed in a bag

232
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:15,609
父さんが残した 熱い想い
The burning passion Father left behind

233
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:23,217
母さんがくれた あのまなざし
The gaze Mother gave me

234
00:24:23,217 --> 00:24:27,521
地球はまわる
The Earth turns

235
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:31,325
君をかくして
Hiding you

236
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:35,429
輝く瞳
Shining eyes

237
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:39,433
きらめく灯
Sparkling lights

238
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:43,437
地球はまわる
The Earth turns

239
00:24:43,437 --> 00:24:47,941
君をのせて
Carrying you

240
00:24:47,941 --> 00:24:52,446
いつかきっと出会う
One day we'll surely meet

241
00:24:52,446 --> 00:25:00,087
ぼくらをのせて
Carrying us

242
00:25:12,503 --> 00:25:20,603
父さんが残した 熱い想い
Father's burning desire he left behind

243
00:25:21,803 --> 00:25:28,103
母さんがくれた あのまなざし
Mother's look she gave me

244
00:25:29,103 --> 00:25:35,903
地球はまわる 君をかくして
The Earth rotates, hiding you

245
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:44,303
輝く瞳 きらめく灯火
Shining eyes, sparkling lights

246
00:25:44,903 --> 00:25:52,603
地球はまわる 君をのせて
The Earth rotates, carrying you

247
00:25:53,403 --> 00:26:01,103
いつかきっと出会う ぼくらをのせて
Someday we will surely meet, carrying us

248
00:26:21,603 --> 00:26:23,603
どうざんなのあ〜！
How was that, nanora!

249
00:26:24,103 --> 00:26:29,903
ルーナの歌、めちゃめちゃ聞き入っちゃったよ！
Luna, I was totally captivated by your singing!

250
00:26:30,103 --> 00:26:33,303
いや、かなたんの歌もかっこよかったのらよ。
No, Kanatan's singing was cool too, nanora.

251
00:26:33,603 --> 00:26:37,103
本当？ あ、じゃあそんな社交辞令も終わったところで。
Really? Well, now that the social niceties are over...

252
00:26:37,603 --> 00:26:38,103
お〜？
Oh?

253
00:26:38,303 --> 00:26:41,103
というわけで、4期生ライブ皆さん楽しんでますかー？
So, is everyone enjoying the 4th generation live?

254
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:42,603
イエーイ！
Yay!

255
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:44,303

つぶやいてのら！
Please tweet about it!

259
00:26:48,603 --> 00:26:52,303
はい、そしてこのステージ見てください。めちゃめちゃ綺麗だよね。
Yes, and look at this stage. It's so beautiful, isn't it?

260
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:53,403
綺麗！
Beautiful!

261
00:26:53,603 --> 00:26:56,903
これね、時間が進むと景色も変わっていくステージでございます。
This is a stage where the scenery changes as time passes.

262
00:26:57,103 --> 00:26:58,303
しゅごいのら〜。
That's amazing, nanora~.

ぜひチェックしてください。
Please check it out.

264
00:26:59,603 --> 00:27:01,403
さてさて、お次の曲なんですが、ルーナさん。
Now then, for the next song... Luna-san.

265
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:03,303
ご準備の方はいかがでしょうか？
How are your preparations coming along?

266
00:27:03,603 --> 00:27:05,903
まあ、任せのら。
Well, leave it to me, nanora.

267
00:27:06,103 --> 00:27:06,503
おお。
Oh.

268
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:11,103
では、次の曲は擦り散らかした「Get Wild」。
Well then, the next song is the well-worn "Get Wild".

269
00:27:11,303 --> 00:27:13,603
Get Wild.

270
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,903
アスファルトタイヤを切りつけながら
Tearing up the asphalt tires

271
00:27:55,103 --> 00:27:58,303
暗闇走り抜ける
Running through the darkness

272
00:27:58,603 --> 00:28:01,903
チープなスリルに身をまかせても
Even if I give myself up to cheap thrills

273
00:28:02,103 --> 00:28:05,903
明日に怯えていたよ
I was afraid of tomorrow

274
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:09,303
It's your pain or my pain or somebody's pain

275
00:28:09,603 --> 00:28:13,103
誰かのために生きられるなら
If I can live for someone else

276
00:28:13,403 --> 00:28:16,603
It's your dream or my dream or somebody's dream

277
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:22,103
何も怖くはない
I'm not afraid of anything

278
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,303
Get wild and tough

279
00:28:26,603 --> 00:28:31,303
ひとりでは解けない愛のパズルを抱いて
Holding the puzzle of love that cannot be solved alone

280
00:28:31,603 --> 00:28:33,303
Get wild and tough

281
00:28:33,403 --> 00:28:38,303
この街でやさしさに甘えていたくはない
I don't want to rely on the kindness in this city

282
00:28:38,603 --> 00:28:40,303
Get chance and luck

283
00:28:40,603 --> 00:28:45,603
君だけが守れるものがどこかにあるさ
There is something that only you can protect somewhere

284
00:28:46,103 --> 00:28:47,903
Get chance and luck

285
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:53,103
ひとりでも傷ついた夢をとりもどすよ
Even alone, I'll take back my wounded dream

286
00:29:07,903 --> 00:29:11,303
クルマのライトにキスを投げては
Throwing a kiss at the car's headlights

287
00:29:11,603 --> 00:29:14,903
シャドウで踊るあの娘
That girl dancing in the shadow

288
00:29:15,103 --> 00:29:18,603
冷たい夜空をステージにして
Making the cold night sky the stage

289
00:29:18,903 --> 00:29:22,303
哀しくおどけていたね
You were joking around sadly

290
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:25,603
It's your pain or my pain or somebody's pain

291
00:29:25,903 --> 00:29:29,403
誰かのために愛せるのなら
If I can love for someone else

292
00:29:29,703 --> 00:29:32,903
It's your dream or my dream or somebody's dream

293
00:29:33,303 --> 00:29:38,303
きっと強くなれる
I can surely become stronger

294
00:29:40,903 --> 00:29:42,603
Get wild and tough

295
00:29:42,903 --> 00:29:47,603
ひとりでは消せない痛み心に抱いて
Holding the pain in my heart that cannot be erased alone

296
00:29:48,103 --> 00:29:49,903
Get wild and tough

297
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:55,103
この街で自由をもてあましだくはない
I don't want to have more freedom than I can handle in this city

298
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:56,903
Get chance and luck

299
00:29:57,103 --> 00:30:00,103
君だけが守れるものがどこかにあるさ
There is something that only you can protect somewhere

300
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:02,219
見つけだしたなら
If I find it...

301
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:04,119
Get wild and tough

302
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,819
一人でも
Even alone

303
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,219
傷ついた夢を取りもどすよ
I'll take back the wounded dream

304
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:26,219
Get wild and tough

305
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:27,819
一人でも
Even alone

306
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:31,319
解けない愛のパズルを抱いて
Holding the unsolvable puzzle of love

307
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:33,219
Get wild and tough

308
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:35,019
この街で
In this city

309
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,619
やさしさに甘えていたくはない
I don't want to rely on kindness

310
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:40,419
Get chance and luck

311
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,219
君だけが
Only you

312
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,919
守れるものがどこかにあるさ
There is something only you can protect somewhere

313
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:47,719
Get wild and tough

314
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:49,319
一人でも
Even alone

315
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:52,919
傷ついた夢を取りもどすよ
I'll take back the wounded dream

316
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,919
Get wild and tough

317
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:58,119
Our step

318
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,419
いつだってそう「僕なんて」さって
Always like that, saying things like "someone like me"

319
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,919
うつむいてばかりのMAYDAY
A MAYDAY where I'm always looking down

320
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:12,819
つまずいて泣いて「どうせ」って口癖が
Stumbling, crying, the habit of saying "anyway"

321
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:14,719
染みついてさ
Is stained into me

322
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,719
いつからかまた積もる焦り
The impatience that has piled up again since when

323
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,319
でも胸の奥にある光
But the light deep in my chest

324
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:25,619
繋ぐ点と線の先へ
Beyond the points and lines connected

325
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:30,419
踏み出すイメージの先へ
Beyond the image of stepping forward

326
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:34,319
遠くたっていい
It's okay if it's far

327
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,219
ほら虹をまたいで
Look, cross the rainbow

328
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:41,919
さあ心のままに音を奏でる
Now, play the sound as your heart desires

329
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,519
逸る鼓動は今を刻む証だ
The rushes of heartbeat are proof of carving the present

330
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:51,519
響け僕らの想いを乗せて
Resonate, carrying our feelings

331
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:55,819
高く遠く歌を紡いで
Spinning a song high and far

332
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:07,719
Lalala...

333
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,919
季節巡って駆け抜けて
Seasons go around, running through

334
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:12,319
気づけば大人になって
Before I knew it, I've become an adult

335
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,919
幼い日の心は胸の奥くすぶってた
The heart of my childhood was smoldering deep in my chest

336
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:20,719
怖いことも増えたけど
Fearful things have increased too

337
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,519
でも今だから見える世界
But the world I can see because it's now

338
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:27,319
今だから信じてる世界
The world I believe in because it's now

339
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:31,919
儚さの中に確かに灯る光
The light that certainly lights up in the fleetingness

340
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:36,719
繋いでいこう
Let's connect it

341
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:41,519
さあ新しいステージへ
Now, to a new stage

342
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:45,419
心の中の音を聴かせて
Let me hear the sound in your heart

343
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:49,219
大袈裟だっていいありのままの自分で
It's okay even if it's an exaggeration, as your true self

344
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:55,519
咲き誇れもっといつまでもずっと
Blooming more, forever and always

345
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:00,719
歌いながら日々を紡いで
Spinning the days while singing

346
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,319
うつむいて泣いた日もあったけど
There were days when I looked down and cried, but

347
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:06,719
涙も力になる
Tears also become strength

348
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:07,919
刻めHEART
Carve the HEART

349
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:08,919
鳴らせBEAT
Sound the BEAT

350
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:12,719
響け僕らのメロディ
Resonate, our melody

351
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,519
ねえあの日の夢も
Hey, the dream of that day

352
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:34,719
今の自分も
and my current self

353
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,519
描く未来も全て抱きしめるよ
The future I draw, I'll embrace it all

354
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,619
さあ旅を続けよう
Now, let's continue the journey

355
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:45,219
どこまでもずっと
wherever and forever

356
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,519
手を繋いで
Holding hands

357
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:52,519
ほら僕らの一歩だ
look, it's our step

358
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:56,119
心のままに音を奏でる
Play the sound as your heart desires

359
00:34:57,219 --> 00:35:00,119
逸る鼓動は...
The rushing heartbeat...

360
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:02,485
今を刻む証が
The proof of living this moment

361
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,260
響け僕らの想いも乗せて
Resonate, carrying our feelings too

362
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,485
高く遠く歌を紡いで
Spinning a song high and far

363
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,435
Lalala

364
00:35:14,435 --> 00:35:15,235
Lalala

365
00:35:15,235 --> 00:35:16,035
Lalala

366
00:35:16,035 --> 00:35:17,460
Lalala

367
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,235
Lalala

368
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:19,035
Lalala

369
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:19,835
Lalala

370
00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:21,560
Lalala

371
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,335
Lalala

372
00:35:22,335 --> 00:35:23,135
Lalala

373
00:35:23,135 --> 00:35:23,960
Lalala

374
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,335
Lalala

375
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:26,260
Lalala

376
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,360
Lalala

377
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,035
Lalala

378
00:35:48,135 --> 00:35:52,135
Overdose

379
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,460
本当は分かっていた いけないことだったって
I actually knew it, that it was something I shouldn't do

380
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,410
分かっていたのに この手をすり抜ける全部が愛に見えたの
I knew it, but everything slipping through these hands
looked like love

381
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:20,260
確かめていた言葉が形になって揺れるだけ yeah
The words I was confirming
just take shape and sway, yeah

382
00:36:20,585 --> 00:36:24,485
弾いて帰ってきたそれだけ つまらないな
It just bounced back and came back, how boring

383
00:36:24,485 --> 00:36:28,585
世界の闇合わせ あとちょっとで分かりかけてたのに
The world's darkness aligning,
I was just about to understand

384
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:32,610
飲んで吐いて 全部忘れちゃえ 水をまとった脳神経
Drink, vomit, forget it all
Cranial nerves covered in water

385
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:36,710
鏡合わせ 見つめ合えたら
Mirror image, if only we could look at each other

386
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:40,610
Overdose 君とふたり やるせない日々
Overdose, just the two of us, these helpless days

387
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:44,710
解像度の悪い夢を見たい
I want to see a low-resolution dream

388
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:48,710
Overdose 君とふたり 甘いハッタリ
Overdose, just the two of us, a sweet bluff

389
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:53,210
Don't stop the music, darling

390
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,285
本当に分かっていた いけないことだったって
I really knew it, that it was something I shouldn't do

391
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:09,260
分かってる 多分 時間だけが過ぎていく 問答で満ちていく
I know. Probably just time passing,
filling up with questions and answers

392
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:17,285
言い訳する間もなく 裸になってしまうだけ yeah
Without even a moment to make excuses,
I just end up naked, yeah

393
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,460
きっと溜まっていくんだずっと 終わってしまえばいいと ふと
It'll surely keep piling up forever,
suddenly thinking it should just end

394
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,710
傷んで腐っていくあの生果実のように僕ら壊れていく
Like that raw fruit that spoils and rots,
we're breaking down

395
00:37:25,985 --> 00:37:29,810
踊って狂って全部忘れちゃえ
Dance, go crazy, forget it all

396
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:33,610
嘘を被った仲良しと隣り合わせ 見つめ合えたら
Side by side with friends wearing lies,
if only we could look at each other

397
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,610
Overdose 君とふたり 分かり合いたいのにお互い
Overdose, just the two of us,
even though we want to understand each other

398
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,710
分が悪い嘘が嫌い
I hate the disadvantageous lies

399
00:37:41,985 --> 00:37:45,660
Overdose 君とふたり 分かり合いたいのにお互い
Overdose, just the two of us,
even though we want to understand each other

400
00:37:45,985 --> 00:37:50,185

Overdose 君とふたり やるせない日々

00:38:24,985 --> 00:38:28,610
Overdose 君とふたり 分からないけどお互い
Overdose, just the two of us,
I don't know but we both...

406
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:32,560
分が悪い嘘でもいい
Even if it's a disadvantageous lie, it's fine

407
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:36,610
Overdose 君とふたり 甘いハッタリ
Overdose, just the two of us, a sweet bluff

408
00:38:36,985 --> 00:38:41,185

Let's start the MC!

412
00:39:10,785 --> 00:39:12,660
じゃあ1人じゃ寂しいので、
Well, since it's lonely alone...

413
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,660
ほい！
Hoi!

414
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,485

Pekotto! I'm going to do the MC with Watame again.

418
00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:22,660
はい、かっこよかったねー！
Yes, that was cool!

419
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,185
ありがとう！
Thank you!

420
00:39:24,285 --> 00:39:27,660
ということで、じゃあお互いのね、あの、歌った曲について触れていきましょうか。
So, let's talk about the songs we both sang.

421
00:39:27,985 --> 00:39:29,685
はい！何歌ったんですか？
Yes! What did you sing?

422
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:36,660
はい、トワは『ギターと孤独と蒼い惑星』と、『Overdose』を歌わせていただきました！
Yes, Towa sang "Guitar, Loneliness and Blue Planet"
and "Overdose"!

423
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,660
歌ったたったたったた！
Sang-sang-sang-sang-sang!

424
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,685
やめて、ねえ。
Stop it, hey.

425
00:39:40,785 --> 00:39:42,260
かっこよかった！
That was cool!

426
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,985
かっこよかったよ、でも、その「歌ったたったた」感が。
It was cool, but that "sang-sang-sang" feel...

427
00:39:46,185 --> 00:39:50,685
はい、でね、その『Overdose』は流行りの曲、たたた、ちょっと歌ってみて、
Yes, and "Overdose" is a popular song,
I tried singing it,

428
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:55,360
あと一曲悩んだんですけど、それはなんかマネちゃんが、トワさんに合うよって言って選んでくれた曲が『ギターと孤独と蒼い惑星』で、今回歌わせていただきました！
and I was undecided about the other song,
but my manager chose "Guitar, Loneliness and Blue Planet"
saying it would suit Towa, so I sang it this time!

429
00:39:55,485 --> 00:39:56,685
そうなんだ。
I see.

430
00:40:00,152 --> 00:40:01,185
何てったの？ ありがとう。
What did you say? Thank you.

431
00:40:01,185 --> 00:40:02,952
確かに。トワも歌いやすかった。
Indeed. It was easy for Towa to sing too.

432
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:03,852
ああー、イエーイ。
Oh, yeah!

433
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,552
迷彩ハイ！
Meisai Hai!

434
00:40:05,552 --> 00:40:07,552
ありがとう。んで、わためが…
Thank you. And, Watame...

435
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:11,852
わためは「イネンジャForever」と「あわすてっぷ」を歌わせていただきました。
Watame performed "Inenja Forever" and "Awasu Step".

436
00:40:11,852 --> 00:40:14,452
おおー！「あわすてっぷ」めっちゃよかった！
Oh! "Awasu Step" was so good!

437
00:40:14,452 --> 00:40:16,952
嬉しい。これが新曲なんだけど…
I'm glad. This is a new song, but...

438
00:40:16,952 --> 00:40:20,352
今までの、私が出した楽曲の歌詞が入ってたり…
...it contains lyrics from songs I've released so far...

439
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:23,252
曲名が入ってたり…
...or song titles...

440
00:40:23,252 --> 00:40:27,652
する、この周年にぴったりの曲になってるんですよ。
...making it a perfect song for this anniversary.

441
00:40:27,652 --> 00:40:32,052
いや、そうなんだよ。トワもリハーサルで聴いてて、「すごいエモい曲、いい曲だね」って言ったら…
Yeah, that's right. Towa heard it in rehearsal and said, "It's a very emotional and good song," and then...

442
00:40:32,052 --> 00:40:36,852
歌詞とかね、曲名が入ってるっていうのを教えてもらったんで、先にちょっと味わっちゃいました。
...I was told that lyrics and song titles were in it, so I already enjoyed it a bit beforehand.

443
00:40:39,652 --> 00:40:40,952
でも！
But!

444
00:40:40,952 --> 00:40:41,952
でも！
But!

445
00:40:41,952 --> 00:40:43,852
皆、待ってるんですよ、これ。
Everyone is waiting for this.

446
00:40:43,852 --> 00:40:45,052
え？何ですか？
Eh? What is it?

ライブ衣装！
Live outfits!

460
00:41:05,652 --> 00:41:08,652
お互い並ぶの初めてだよね。初めてだね。
It's the first time we line up like this. First time, right?

461
00:41:08,652 --> 00:41:11,952
ちょっとシナジーがあったり、このヒラヒラとか。
There's some synergy, like these frills.

462
00:41:11,952 --> 00:41:13,952
確かにね。
True.

463
00:41:13,952 --> 00:41:15,652
ちょっとスクショタイムするか。
Let's do some screenshot time.

464
00:41:15,652 --> 00:41:16,852
しようよ。あ、ここにいてね。
Let's. Ah, stay here.

465
00:41:19,152 --> 00:41:21,152
イエーイ。
Yay.

466
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,152
羊ピース？
Hitsuji Peace?

467
00:41:23,152 --> 00:41:24,152
イエーイ。
Yay.

468
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:25,952
羊ピース！ハート？
Hitsuji Peace! Heart?

469
00:41:25,952 --> 00:41:27,652
あ、もうやってるし。
Oh, you're already doing it.

470
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:30,952
イエーイ。
Yay.

471
00:41:32,152 --> 00:41:34,652
まぁ, 撮れたところで。
Well, now that we've taken them.

472
00:41:34,652 --> 00:41:36,652
えー、そうですよ。我々、なんと今日で…
Yes, so. As of today, we...

473
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:39,052
5周年！
5th anniversary!

474
00:41:39,052 --> 00:41:41,352
5周年か、早いなぁ。
5th anniversary... it's fast.

475
00:41:41,352 --> 00:41:45,452
いや、もう5周年なんて言ったら我々もね、お局さんですから。
Well, 5 years means we are already senior ladies.

476
00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:46,452
お局？
Senior ladies?

477
00:41:46,452 --> 00:41:47,552
お局さんです。
Senior ladies.

478
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:48,452
5年で？
In 5 years?

479
00:41:48,452 --> 00:41:49,352
お姉さん？
Older sisters?

480
00:41:49,352 --> 00:41:50,152
5年ですよ。
5 years.

481
00:41:50,152 --> 00:41:51,752
後輩いっぱい入ってきたでしょ。
Many juniors have come in, right?

482
00:41:51,752 --> 00:41:54,352
確かにね。もう中堅ぐらいになっちゃったよ。
True. We've become like middle management.

483
00:41:54,352 --> 00:41:56,052
ちょっと、もうおばさんです。
We're already old ladies.

484
00:41:56,052 --> 00:41:57,552
おいおいおい！
Hey, hey, hey!

485
00:41:57,552 --> 00:41:58,852
まだまだですよ。
Not yet.

486
00:41:58,852 --> 00:41:59,952
まだ？
Still?

487
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:01,552
まだまだ。じゃあ、ちなみに。
Not yet. By the way...

488
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,652
6年目に入るわけですよ。
...we're entering our 6th year.

489
00:42:03,652 --> 00:42:06,152
6年目の目標、聞いていいですか？
Can I ask your goal for the 6th year?

490
00:42:06,152 --> 00:42:08,752
まだまだね、ピッチピチに。
Well, staying perfectly fresh.

491
00:42:08,752 --> 00:42:12,052
若い子には負けんぞっていう気持ちで頑張っていきたいと思っとります。
I want to keep working hard with a feeling of not losing to the young ones.

492
00:42:12,052 --> 00:42:14,452
おばさんやないか！
You're an old lady!

493
00:42:14,452 --> 00:42:16,752
もう負けてるやないか。「ピッチピチ」って言ってる時点で。
You're already losing! Just by saying "fresh".

494
00:42:16,752 --> 00:42:19,552
自分がピッチピチじゃないって言ってるやないか。
You're admitting you're not fresh yourself.

495
00:42:19,552 --> 00:42:22,152
ピッチピチだよ！
I'm fresh!

496
00:42:22,152 --> 00:42:23,652
まぁ、そうだね。そんなトワっちは何かあるの？
Well, true. What about you, Towa-chi?

497
00:42:23,652 --> 00:42:25,652
そうですね、6年目は…
Well, for the 6th year...

498
00:42:25,652 --> 00:42:27,852
健康に暮らしたいですね。
...I want to live healthily.

499
00:42:27,852 --> 00:42:29,752
ババアやないか！
You're a grandma!

500
00:42:29,752 --> 00:42:32,552
苦しいー！苦しいー！
That hurts! That hurts!

501
00:42:32,552 --> 00:42:34,652
ババアは言い過ぎた、ごめん。
Grandma was too much, sorry.

502
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:37,152
いや、まぁ、大丈夫ですよ。全然傷ついてないですから。
No, it's fine. I'm not hurt at all.

503
00:42:37,152 --> 00:42:39,152
そうだね。言い慣れてるから。
Right. Because I'm used to it.

504
00:42:39,152 --> 00:42:41,452
おい！
Hey!

505
00:42:41,452 --> 00:42:43,152
捲（まく）ってるぞ、お前。
You're hitting back!

506
00:42:43,152 --> 00:42:45,452
すみません、ループしてますよ、皆さん。ループしてますよ。
Sorry, everyone, we're in a loop. We're looping.

507
00:42:45,452 --> 00:42:47,452
お祝いの場だよ。
It's a celebration!

508
00:42:47,452 --> 00:42:50,152
もうこんな、もう次の曲行けなくなっちゃうじゃん。
We can't move to the next song like this.

509
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:52,652
一緒に歌うんだよ。まだ終わってないよ。
We're singing together. It's not over yet.

510
00:42:52,652 --> 00:42:54,752
そうだよね。
True.

511
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:58,352
じゃあ、ちょっと次の曲。落ち着かせて、行きたいと思います。
Well, let's calm down and go to the next song.

512
00:42:58,352 --> 00:43:00,152
落ち着かせて。はい。
Calm down. Yes.

513
00:43:00,152 --> 00:43:03,152
じゃあ、一緒にタイトルコールしてね。
Then, do the title call with me.

514
00:43:03,152 --> 00:43:04,752
はい。
Yes.

515
00:43:04,752 --> 00:43:08,652
では、聴いてください。「メリーゴーランド」。
Well then, please listen to "Merry-Go-Round".

516
00:43:22,652 --> 00:43:26,652
メリーゴーランド 作詞・作曲：優里
Merry-Go-Round Lyrics/Composition: Yuuri

517
00:43:30,352 --> 00:43:34,452
好きになるってどんなこと
What does it mean to fall in love?

518
00:43:34,452 --> 00:43:38,352
新しい自分に会うこと
It's meeting a new version of yourself

519
00:43:38,352 --> 00:43:45,952
好きと口にできなかったこと
The things I couldn't say I liked

520
00:43:45,952 --> 00:43:50,152
あなたの幸せの中
In the midst of your happiness

521
00:43:50,152 --> 00:43:54,152
私がいなかったこと
The fact that I wasn't there

522
00:43:54,152 --> 00:44:01,952
それを受け入れてしまったこと
The fact that I accepted that

523
00:44:01,952 --> 00:44:09,752
一人泣いてたバスタブの中
In the bathtub where I cried alone

524
00:44:09,752 --> 00:44:17,552
顔が痛くて あなたに会いたくて
My face hurt, I wanted to see you

525
00:44:17,552 --> 00:44:21,552
愛してるって何回
How many times did I say "I love you"?

526
00:44:21,552 --> 00:44:25,552
私口にしたのだろう
How many times did I utter those words?

527
00:44:25,552 --> 00:44:29,552
なのにどうして 今そばに
Yet why, right now, by my side...

528
00:44:29,552 --> 00:44:33,552
誰もいないの
...is there no one there?

529
00:44:33,552 --> 00:44:37,552
愛してるって何回
How many times did I hear "I love you"?

530
00:44:37,552 --> 00:44:41,552
私耳にしたのなら
If I had only heard those words

531
00:44:41,552 --> 00:44:45,552
寂しさだけが この胸に
Only loneliness, in this chest...

532
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:49,952
残っているのです
...is what remains

533
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:58,452
好きになるってどんなこと
What does it mean to fall in love?

534
00:45:00,169 --> 00:45:01,469
...一人泣いていたら
...if I were crying alone,

535
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:07,969
そばにいないといけないと思うこと
I'd think that I have to be by your side.

536
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:15,669
一人泣いた　ベッドの中
Crying alone in bed.

537
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:25,169
声も顔も　心も愛せない
I can't love your voice, your face, or your heart.

538
00:45:25,283 --> 00:45:30,169
違う場所に生まれてたのなら
If I had been born in a different place...

539
00:45:30,416 --> 00:45:34,169
違う私だったのかな
...would I have been a different person?

540
00:45:34,383 --> 00:45:37,669
生まれ変われるのなら
If I could be reborn,

541
00:45:37,669 --> 00:45:41,369
一人じゃなくなるかな
would I not be alone anymore?

542
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:44,369
会いに行くってもう何度
How many times have I said,

543
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:49,169
私口にしたのだろう
'I'll go to see you'?

544
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:53,169
なのにどうして今そばに
Then why is there no one

545
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:56,669
誰もいないの
by my side right now?

546
00:45:57,549 --> 00:46:00,669
会いに来てってもう何度
How many times have I heard you say,

547
00:46:00,669 --> 00:46:05,269
私耳にしたのだろう
'Come and see me'?

548
00:46:05,283 --> 00:46:09,669
後悔だけがこの胸に
Only regret remains

549
00:46:09,669 --> 00:46:13,669
残ってるのです
in my heart.

550
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:17,469
もしもあの日あの瞬間に
If at that moment on that day,

551
00:46:17,469 --> 00:46:21,969
わがままを口にできたら
I could have spoken my selfish wish...

552
00:46:22,016 --> 00:46:26,669
思い切り泣いて　その胸に
Crying my eyes out, in your arms,

553
00:46:26,716 --> 00:46:29,469
また会える
we could meet again.

554
00:46:29,783 --> 00:46:35,169
また会える
We can meet again...

555
00:46:36,316 --> 00:46:39,169
どんなに追いかけても
No matter how much I chase it,

556
00:46:39,169 --> 00:46:43,169
追いつかないメリーゴーランド
this merry-go-round I can't catch up to.

557
00:46:43,316 --> 00:46:46,569
愛するってほら
Look, loving someone

558
00:46:46,569 --> 00:46:51,469
こんなに苦しいのです
is so painful.

559
00:46:51,516 --> 00:46:54,769
それすらも愛して
Loving even that,

560
00:46:54,769 --> 00:46:59,769
生きていくと思えるほど
to the point where I think I can live on...

561
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:04,369
あなたのことを心から
...I'm thinking of you

562
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:08,669
思っているのです
from the bottom of my heart.

563
00:47:08,683 --> 00:47:24,169
ルルルルル...
Lu lu lu lu lu...

Well, steady progress, day and night reversal, Vocaloid 30 watts.

566
00:48:24,983 --> 00:48:31,669
テレキャスター背負ったサブカルボーイがバンド仲間にゃハッタリを
A subculture boy with a Telecaster on his back, bluffing to his bandmates.

567
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:37,469
湯冷めしちゃって　お嬢ちゃん
You've got a chill, little girl.

568
00:48:37,549 --> 00:48:41,469
お金も才能もなまじあるだけ厄介です
Having money and talent half-heartedly just makes things troublesome.

569
00:48:41,483 --> 00:48:43,169
Boys be ambitious　(はいはい)
Boys be ambitious (Yeah, yeah)

570
00:48:43,249 --> 00:48:44,569
Like this old man

571
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:47,969
長い前髪　君誰の信者
Long bangs, whose follower are you?

572
00:48:48,049 --> 00:48:51,169
信者...
Follower...

573
00:48:51,669 --> 00:48:53,169
信者...
Follower...

574
00:48:53,669 --> 00:48:55,169
信者...
Follower...

575
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:03,369
勘違いすんな　教祖はお前だ
Don't get it twisted, the cult leader is you.

576
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:06,669
ロキロキのロックンロックンロール
Roki, Roki, rock 'n' rock 'n' roll!

577
00:49:06,749 --> 00:49:10,269
かき鳴らすエレクトリックギターは
Strumming that electric guitar...

578
00:49:10,316 --> 00:49:13,669
Don't Stop! Don't Stop!

579
00:49:13,683 --> 00:49:15,269
さあ　君のすべてを
Now, show me

580
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:17,469

Well, steady progress, writing a song,

583
00:49:22,483 --> 00:49:24,169
フォロワー増えてる
followers are increasing.

584
00:49:24,249 --> 00:49:27,369
でもあの頃の人気はそんなにないから
But your popularity isn't what it used to be,

585
00:49:27,416 --> 00:49:30,669
色々大変ですね
so it's pretty tough, isn't it?

586
00:49:30,883 --> 00:49:34,169
はっきり言うな　匿名愛好
Don't say it so bluntly, lover of anonymity.

587
00:49:34,249 --> 00:49:37,569
はっきり見せない　実写のアイコン
Refusing to show your real-life face in your icon.

588
00:49:37,616 --> 00:49:41,669
愛おしいほど　自意識過剰ボーイ
So endearing, you self-conscious boy.

589
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:44,669
ぶっちゃけ　どんだけ　賢く
To be honest, no matter how clever

590
00:49:44,683 --> 00:49:46,269
あざとく　やったって
or calculating you are,

591
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:49,769
10年後にメイクは落ちてんだよ
in 10 years, the makeup will have worn off.

592
00:49:49,783 --> 00:49:51,469
Boys be ambitious　(はいはい)
Boys be ambitious (Yeah, yeah)

593
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:52,769
Like this old man

594
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:56,269
生き抜くためだ　決めろ Selfy
It's to survive, strike a pose for the selfie.

595
00:49:56,316 --> 00:49:59,169
Selfy...
Selfie...

596
00:49:59,669 --> 00:50:01,169
Selfy...
Selfie...

597
00:50:01,669 --> 00:50:03,169
Selfy...
Selfie...

598
00:50:08,683 --> 00:50:12,269
死ぬんじゃねえぞ　お互いにな
