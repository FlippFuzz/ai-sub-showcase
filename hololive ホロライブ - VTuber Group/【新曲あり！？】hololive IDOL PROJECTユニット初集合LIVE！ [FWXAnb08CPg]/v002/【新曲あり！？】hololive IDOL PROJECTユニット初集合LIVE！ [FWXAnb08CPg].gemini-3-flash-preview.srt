4
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,000
今日が初ライブ！
Today is our first live!

5
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,000
その目にしっかり焼き付けてねー！
Make sure to burn this into your eyes!

6
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,500
些細な事　逆らって
Resisting even the trivial things

7
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,500
いつの間にか　痛みだしていた
Before I knew it, it started to hurt

8
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,500
一人じゃないって　分かってるけど
I know I'm not alone, but

9
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,800
どうしても孤独に呑まれそう
I feel like I'm being swallowed by loneliness anyway

10
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,500
同じ場所で躓いても
Even if I stumble in the same place

11
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
少しずつ進んでいければいいから
It's okay as long as I can move forward little by little

12
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,500
触れられなくてもここには
Even if I can't touch it, right here

13
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,000
確かな光あるんだ
There is a certain light

14
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
ボクらは　散るまでずっとサバイバー
We are survivors until the very end

15
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,200
道なき道を往く
Going down a pathless road

16
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,500
誰もが　迷える子羊なんだ
Everyone is a lost lamb

17
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,200
聞かせて　小さなことも
Tell me, even the little things

18
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,200
ah　完璧じゃなくても
Ah, even if it's not perfect

19
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,500
前を向いたのならきっと繋がっていく
If you look forward, it will surely connect

20
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,500
終わりのない闇の中で
In the endless darkness

21
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,000
俯いては溢れ出す溜息
A sigh that overflows when I look down

22
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,500
出口のないことばかりを
With nothing but things with no exit

23
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,500
考えてまた繰り返して
I think about them again and again

24
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,800
うまく伝えられなくても
Even if I can't convey it well

25
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,500
言葉を重ねてみたいんだよ
I want to try layering words

26
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,200
踏み出す一歩怖くても
Even if taking the first step is scary

27
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,800
その先の景色見たいんだ
I want to see the scenery beyond that

28
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
天使と悪魔がついてるから
Because an angel and a devil are with you

29
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,333
いつでも
Anytime,

30
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,433
すぐそばに
Right by your side.

31
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,533
荒波だらけの
A battlefield full of rough waves

32
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:10,033
戦場がなんだ
Is no problem for us.

33
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:15,533
ボクらはきっと大丈夫
We'll surely be alright.

34
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,433
ah 痛みの分だけ
Ah, just as much as the pain,

35
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:23,033
強くなれてるんだ、ってさ
We're growing stronger, they say,

36
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:27,033
信じてる
And I believe it.

37
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,833
知らずに「普通」の檻に
Without knowing, in the cage of 'normality',

38
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,833
囚われていた無意識を
The unconsciousness that was imprisoned...

39
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:46,033
そっと解放してみよう さぁ
Let's gently release it, come on.

40
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:52,033
ボクらは散るまでずっと
We are survivors

41
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:57,033
サバイバー
Until the moment we fall.

42
00:05:57,033 --> 00:06:00,333
道なき道を往く
Treading on a pathless path,

43
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:05,333
誰もが迷える子羊なんだ
Everyone is just a lost lamb.

44
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:13,333
聞かせて 小さなことも
Let me hear it, even the smallest things.

45
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:17,033
ah 完璧じゃなくても
Ah, even if it's not perfect,

46
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:21,033
前を向けたのならきっと
If you can look forward, surely,

47
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:25,033
繋がっていく
We'll stay connected.

48
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:59,333
諦めない そう決めたの
I won't give up, that's what I decided.

49
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:04,333
赤き心を燃やして
Burning my crimson heart.

50
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:17,333
正解か 不正解かは
Whether it's right or wrong,

51
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:21,633
どうだっていいんだってさ
They say it doesn't matter.

52
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:26,333
走り抜けた足跡 そのまま
The footprints of our sprint, just as they are,

53
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:30,533
物語になっていく
Will become a story.

54
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:36,533
擦りむいた 瘡蓋なぞって
Tracing the scabs of our grazes,

55
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:40,733
痛みをチカラに変えていくんだ
We'll turn the pain into strength.

56
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:46,533
何度も 翼広げて
Spreading our wings again and again,

57
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:55,733
ここに刻む この鼓動が真実のsign
This heartbeat etched here is a sign of truth.

58
00:07:55,733 --> 00:08:00,033
限界だって
Blowing away even our limits,

59
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:04,533
吹き飛ばして
We'll keep going.

60
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:09,133
燃えて燃えて燃え尽きても また甦る
Even if we burn and burn out, we'll revive again.

61
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:13,533
決して諦めたくはないから
Because I never want to give up.

62
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:18,033
Like a Phoenix

63
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:27,533
揺れて 躓いても
Even if we waver and stumble,

64
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:32,333
消えない 燈火
The light will not go out.

65
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:36,133
心駆り立てるから
It stirs my heart,

66
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:41,233
幾度も 灰になっても構わない
I don't mind turning to ash many times.

67
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:47,333
見上げれば 高すぎる空
Looking up, the sky is so high,

68
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:52,033
眩暈がしても 止められないんだ
Even if I feel dizzy, I can't be stopped.

69
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:56,533
感情を 滾らせながら
Letting my emotions boil over,

70
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,733
光求め もがいている 本能のscream
Seeking light, struggling, an instinctive scream.

71
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:10,033
停滞なんて
Smashing through any stagnation,

72
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:14,533
ぶち壊して
We'll keep going.

73
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:19,133
息を切らし 不器用でも たどり着くから
Out of breath, clumsy as we are, we'll reach it.

74
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:23,533
最短距離で駆け抜けたいんだ
I want to sprint through the shortest distance.

75
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:28,033
Like a Phoenix

76
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:46,433
声を枯らしてもまだ
Even if my voice goes hoarse, still,

77
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:51,333
届けたい熱が冷めなくて
The heat I want to deliver won't cool down.

78
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:56,533
溢れてく 思いの分だけ
Overflowing, as much as our feelings,

79
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:59,733
決意を速度に変えて
Turning our determination into speed.

80
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:01,395
決意を速度に変えて
Change your determination into speed

81
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:02,145
higher!

82
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:04,145
higher!

83
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:07,445
何度も翼広げて
Spreading my wings many times

84
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,845
ここに刻む鼓動だけが真実のsign
Only the heartbeat carved here is the sign of truth

85
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:19,945
限界だって
Even if it's the limit

86
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:25,845
吹き飛ばしてく
I'll blow it away

87
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:29,445
燃えて 燃えて 燃え尽きてもまた蘇る
Burning, burning, even if I burn out, I will rise again

88
00:10:30,345 --> 00:10:34,645
決して諦めたくはないから
Because I never want to give up

89
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:39,145
Like a Phoenix

90
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:07,545
Speak up about your unspoken prayer

91
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:13,045
We are the one that rescues you right now

92
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:15,845

Speak up about your unspoken prayer

95

We are the one that rescues you all

96
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:28,445
禁じ手だらけの人生
A life full of forbidden moves

97
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:31,245
演じてたはずの理想像
The ideal image I was supposed to be performing

98
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:36,445
今日だけは全て解き放って
Just for today, release everything

99
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:39,545
見て 信じてみるのもいいね
Look, it's okay to try believing

100
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:44,245
決して忘れることのない
That I will never forget

101
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:48,045
音を聞かせるから
Because I'll let you hear the sound

102
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:49,845
Here we are to save you

If you're going to obey, I'm gonna give you chances

109

To the hell or to the heaven

Like flowers falling elegantly

183
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:10,707

A little bit painful, but...

224
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:21,057
わーー！はい、はい、はい、はい！
Waaa! Yes, yes, yes, yes!

225
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:24,907
一曲目からちょっと激しい曲やっちゃいましたね。
We just did a bit of a high-energy song right from the start.

226
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:26,557
やっちゃいましたね。
We did.

227
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:28,057
やっちゃいましたね、ドキドキしておりますけれども。
We did, I'm nervous but excited.

228
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:31,057
皆さん見てくれてありがとうございます！
Everyone, thank you for watching!

229
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:33,407
ありがとーー！ありがとうございます！
Thank you! Thank you very much!

230
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:37,907
ってことで改めてね、自己紹介をしていきましょー！
So, once again, let's do our self-introductions!

231
00:19:37,907 --> 00:19:41,057
いぇーい！フーフー！
Yeeey! Hoo hoo!

232
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:46,907
はい！いろはにほへと あやふぶみ、フブ担当なのかな？白上フブキです！
Hi! Irohanihoheto AyaFubuMi's Fubu-representative, I guess? I'm Shirakami Fubuki!

233
00:19:47,057 --> 00:19:49,057
いぇーい！フブ担当だよ！
Yeeey! You're the Fubu-representative!

234
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:50,907
フブフブフブ！そしてそしてそして！
Fubu fubu fubu! And, and, and!

235
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:56,907
はい！あやふぶみのあや担当の百鬼あやめです！
Hi! I'm AyaFubuMi's Aya-representative, Nakiri Ayame!

236
00:19:57,057 --> 00:19:59,557
よよよよ～！
Yo yo yo yo!

237
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:02,200
おはー！
Oha!

238
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:08,637
おはよーみの、みたとの、大神ミオでーす！
Good morning everyone! It's Ookami Mio!

239
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:11,599
おはどこへやってしまったのか...
Where did the "Oha" go?

240
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,179
いなくなった、いなくなりました。
It's gone, it disappeared.

241
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:22,587
ってことでね、1曲目はね、皆さん大好き、鬼灯ダンス、踊らせていただきましたけども。
So, the first song was "Onikemo Dance," which everyone loves.

242
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:23,587
鬼灯ダンスー！
Onikemo Dance!

243
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:25,089
いや、疲れたね。
Wow, that was tiring.

244
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:26,089
しんどいです。
I'm exhausted.

245
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:30,069
あやふびみの中でこれがマックス...これが限界マックスの曲だぞ！
This is the max for AyaFubiMio... this song is our absolute limit!

246
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:37,069
いや、この後も曲が控えてるということでね。
Well, we have more songs coming up.

247
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,069
恐ろしいですよ、恐ろしいですよ、はい。
That's scary, that's scary.

248
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:43,069
ちなみにさっきのおにけも間違えた人ー？
By the way, who messed up the Onikemo Dance just now?

249
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:44,069
はーい！
Me!

250
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:48,069
みんな、細かいところちょくちょく間違えました。
Everyone, we all messed up small parts here and there.

251
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:51,069
ちょいちょいね、間違えてると思いますけどもね。
A little bit here and there, I think we made mistakes.

252
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:55,069
いや、足とかこれね、むちゃくちゃだったけど。
Yeah, the legwork was a mess.

253
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:57,069
ワンチャン、カメラで見えてない可能性もある。
There's a chance the camera didn't catch it.

254
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:59,069
カットされてるかもしれないのでね。
It might have been cut out.

255
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:05,069
見ないふりしてください、お願いします！
Please pretend you didn't see anything!

256
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:12,069
ね、でもしかしこうやってね、おにけもね、ホロライブの公式放送で踊ったっけ？
But anyway, have we ever danced Onikemo on an official Hololive broadcast?

257
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:21,069
踊ったことはない、初めて。踊ったことはないよね？初めてだよね？
We haven't. It's the first time. Right? First time?

258
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:25,069
初めてだったよね、初お披露目みたいな。
It was the first time, like a debut performance.

259
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:28,069
MVではね、踊ってましたけどもね。
We did dance in the MV, though.

260
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:34,069
ね、皆様これTikTokとかにも上がってて、いろいろな方が踊ってくださいましたけど。
It's on TikTok too, and many people have danced to it.

261
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:38,069
皆様、ちゃんと踊ってくれました？これ、テュッテュッテュッテュッ...
Did you all dance to it properly? This part...

262
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:41,069
カラオケとかでガチ恋口上とかね。
Like doing the Gachikoi call at karaoke.

263
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:45,069
ね、皆様ちゃんと言ってくれましたか？言えるかな？
Did everyone do the call? Can you say it?

264
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:52,069
やっぱりおにけもみみ可愛いよー！うー！そーれー！はーっ！
As expected, Onikemo ears are cute! Woo! There! Ha!

265
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:57,069
よー！よー！よー！よー！よー！よー！
Yo! Yo! Yo!

266
00:21:57,069 --> 00:22:00,069
あれ？あれ？あれ？ラップみたいになってますけど。
Wait, it's turning into a rap.

267
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,069
そうやね。でもこの曲やっぱり勢いがあっていいね。
That's true. But this song has great energy.

268
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:08,069
またなんかおにけもダンスみたいな曲も3人で踊れたらいいな、チラッ、チラッ。
I hope the three of us can dance to a song like Onikemo Dance again. *Glance, glance*

269
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:11,569
チラッ、チラッ。
*Glance, glance*

270
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:15,069
まあ、もうちょっと速さ的には、もうちょっと落としてもいい。あ、逆？
Well, maybe a bit slower... oh, the other way?

271
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:18,069
わかんない、もっと速くなってくるかも、今度は。
I don't know, it might get even faster next time.

272
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:22,069
さらに上がってく？さらにもしすると...さらに上を行く？
Even faster? Maybe... even higher?

273
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:30,069
痙攣しちゃうよ、もう！ダンスやってたら、もしかするとね、ちょっと痙攣しながらやることになるかも。
I'll have a seizure! If we keep dancing like that, I might end up doing it while twitching!

274
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:32,069
それはまずい、それはまずい。
That's not good, that's not good.

275
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:36,069
はい、もうちょっとBPM落とした感じの曲とかね、歌いたいね。
Yeah, I'd like to sing a song with a lower BPM.

276
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:37,069
ゆったりで、ゆったりでお願いします。
Slowly, please. Keep it slow.

277
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:48,069
そしてそして、次の曲は、お、何を歌うんですか、ミオさん？
And now, for the next song... Oh, what are we singing, Mio-san?

278
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:53,069
あ、あ、あ、次の曲いっちゃいますか？いいですか？
Ah, ah, ah, should we move to the next song? Is it okay?

279
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:58,069
ま、実はね、我々発表させていただいた曲で、まだダンスをお披露目してない曲ありますよ。
Actually, there's a song we've released but haven't performed the dance for yet.

280
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:05,069
曲はみんな聞いたことあると思いますけども。
I think everyone has heard the song.

281
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:08,569
その曲をやっちゃおうかなって。
I'm thinking of doing that song.

282
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:13,069
え！いいんですか？やっちゃいますか？
Eh! Is it okay? Are we doing it?

283
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:16,069
そんなに動いて大丈夫ですか？この後のダンス、体力やばい...
Is it okay to move that much? The dance after this... my stamina is low.

284
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:22,069
はい、ちょっとね、準備しましょうかね。
Right, let's get ready.

285
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,569
この状態で言うの？それでは聴いてください、って。
Saying it in this pose? "Now, please listen"?

286
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:33,069
それでは聴いてください、鬼灯日和！
Now, please listen: Hozuki Biyori!

288
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,169
沈む朱音日 染まる坂道
The setting crimson sun dyes the slope

289
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:05,869
伝う雫に 嬉しさ滲む
Tears flow down, blurring with joy

290

292
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:27,769

Meeting in front of the Inari shrine, passing through the row of torii gates

293
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:36,069
鬼灯の甘い風 胸をすり抜けていく
The sweet wind of ground cherries slips through my chest

294

踊ろうよ
Let's dance

295
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:40,869
廻れ 廻れ 手を叩いてほら
Spin, spin, clap your hands, look

296
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:44,269
見様見真似で輪になって
Form a circle, following what you see

297
00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:50,469
ぎこちない振付に舞う 袂はひらひら
Dancing with awkward steps, sleeves fluttering

298

踊れ 踊れ 手をとりあって
Dance, dance, taking each other's hands

上気した頬 牡丹色
Flushed cheeks, the color of peonies

鳴り響く 太鼓の音に
To the resounding beat of the drums

301

紅く、飛沫弾けた
Red, droplets burst forth

302
00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:05,781
キミに気づかれたかな？
I wonder if you noticed me?

303
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:21,481
響くざわめき
Resonant murmurs,

304
00:25:21,581 --> 00:25:24,481

揺らぐ気持ちに
Let your feelings

306
00:25:27,881 --> 00:25:30,281

00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:54,081
玉響に揺らめいて
Wavering for a moment,

314
00:25:54,181 --> 00:25:57,081
胸をすり抜けたら
if it slips through my chest,

315
00:25:58,781 --> 00:26:00,181
目を閉じて
close your eyes.

316
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:03,581
