33
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:58,508
You should take a look at my Chattino!

My tail!

38
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,508

40
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:19,008

You come here! Oh, now!

46
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:40,508
How dare you! How dare you knock me off like this!

47
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:42,508
Huh? Hey!

48
00:07:43,008 --> 00:07:45,508
You can... you can talk?

49
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,808
Oh, that's impressive.

50
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:51,008
Well, I'm guessing you need me for something?

51
00:07:51,108 --> 00:07:52,008
What do you need?

52
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:57,408
Yeah. There's this thing we want, but... The only way you can get it is by clearing all the Mini-Games here in Chattini Land!

53
00:07:57,508 --> 00:07:59,508
Eh? Mini-Games?

54
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:04,008
Something you can only get here by clearing mini-games?

55
00:08:04,508 --> 00:08:06,508
Eh, I think I know what it is!

56
00:08:06,808 --> 00:08:08,508
It's... that thing over there!

57
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,508
Eh? Eh? Eh? Whoa!

58
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:16,508
Ah! I knew it! It's a jetpack!

59
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:22,008
Oh, the Chattini want one so badly, right?

60
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:26,508
We can't get it on our own, though, so help us out Raora! Please!

61
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:30,008
Ah, are you begging me? Hmm...

62
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:34,508
Well, you know, little one...

63
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:42,508
No! I told you I'm not giving you the jetpack! So, I'm leaving! Bye-bye! Ciao!

64
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:46,508
Please! Please! Pleeeease!

65
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:51,508
Eh? Are you following me? Oh...

66
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:58,508
Well, I guess it's a special day after all. Hmm...

67
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:02,508
You know what? I'll give it a shot!

Yaaaaaay!

69
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:07,008
Ha! Okay! So then, what should I do here?

70
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:10,008
The game's in this area of the land, so good luck!

71
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:14,508
Okay then, you know what? I'm gonna do my very best!

72
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:22,508
Well, I should go then! Ganba-Raora! Raooooooo~!

00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:32,016
もっとこの穴を愛してよ、だっせ！
Love this hole more, so uncool!

149
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:44,016
Chattini Land Flower Garden Area

150
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:49,016
Whoa! Look at this place!

151
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:53,016
I was not expecting to play a game in such a pretty place.

152
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:58,016
And I wonder what kind of game it's gonna be... Hmm.

153
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:00,016
Raora!

154
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:01,316
Eh?

155
00:13:01,316 --> 00:13:02,816
This is your conscience.

156
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:05,016
Eh? My conscience? Do I have one?

157
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:06,016
Oh, Mori!

158
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:07,516
Yo, what's up? Your turn!

159
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:10,016
Eh? Is that...? Say something, say something!

160
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:13,516
Ra-ora-ora-ora-ora!

161
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:17,016
Eh? Is that...? Is that a ghost? What is that? Where is...?

162
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:20,516
I can't see anyone!

163
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:23,016
Ra-ora-ora-ora-ora!

164
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:25,516
Eh? Is that a dog?

165
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:27,516
Hey! It's your senpai!

166
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:34,016
Congrats Raora on your 3D debut!

167
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:36,516
Thank you! We're so happy for you!

168
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:40,016
Oh, thank you so much! I'm so happy to be here with you!

169
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:43,016
Congratulations! Yay! Yay!

170
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:46,016
Cute! Cute! Thank you!

171
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:48,016
No, you're cute!

172
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:51,016
No, you! No, you! No, you!

173
00:13:51,016 --> 00:13:53,016
Kawaii! No way!
Cute! No way!

174
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:55,016
Thank you!

175
00:13:55,016 --> 00:13:58,516
Well, as you may have assumed by our grand entrance over here...

176
00:13:58,516 --> 00:14:02,016
...your opponents for this mini-game are, as you see...

177
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:05,016
Meena-san, Mori Calliope from hololive English first generation Myth!
Everyone, Mori Calliope from hololive English first generation Myth!

178
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:08,516
If you don't know me, now you do! Who's over here?

179
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:12,516
Kronichiwa babe! This is Ouro Kronii from hololive English Promise!

180
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:15,516
And um, who could this beautiful woman be?

181
00:14:15,516 --> 00:14:17,516
誰ですか？
Who is it?

182
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:19,016
ですか？ あ...
Is it? Ah...

183
00:14:19,016 --> 00:14:20,516
どっちこっち？
This way, that way?

184
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:22,016
あ、こっち！
Ah, this way!

185
00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:24,016
どっちこっちこっち？ ゆびゆび！
This way, that way, this way? Yubi yubi!

186
00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:28,016
ホロライブから来ました戌神ころね、よろしくね！
I'm Inugami Korone from Hololive, nice to meet you!

187
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:31,016
Whoo! よろしく！
Whoo! Nice to meet you!

188
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:33,516
Yay! 先輩！ 先輩！
Yay! Senpai! Senpai!

189
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:35,516
はじめまして！
Nice to meet you!

190
00:14:35,516 --> 00:14:37,516
はじめまして！
Nice to meet you!

191
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:41,016
今日は来てくれてありがとうございます！
Thank you for coming today!

192
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:43,016
お、日本語上手！
Oh, your Japanese is good!

193
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,016
はじめまして！ イェイェイェー！
Nice to meet you! Yay-yay-yay!

194
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:46,516
イェイェイェー！
Yay-yay-yay!

195
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:48,016
Oh very good! Thank you so much Mori!

196
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:51,016
What kind of game are we gonna play today?

197
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:53,016
Well, get ready...

198
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:56,516
...because it's time for...

199
00:14:56,516 --> 00:15:00,016
One, two, three, Say Cheese!

200
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:07,424
All right.

201
00:15:07,424 --> 00:15:09,124
Now then,

202
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:10,524
here are the rules.

203
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:16,124
Chattini jump out of the bush holding a camera!

204
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:22,524
And when they do so, you gotta enter the frame and then strike a specific pose for them!

205
00:15:23,024 --> 00:15:25,524
Oh, okay, okay. Sounds easy.

206
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,524
Like that, like that! Just move into the camera frame

207
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:31,524
and strike the pose once the Chattini jump out.

208
00:15:33,524 --> 00:15:36,024
And... oh! This is a good example! Yeah, exactly!

209
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:41,824
She's a little too hyped for that.

210
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:42,824
I know.

211
00:15:42,824 --> 00:15:44,224
Bani-hop!

212
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:46,524
No, no, no, you have to be competitive. You have to be competitive in this game. Yes.

213
00:15:47,024 --> 00:15:54,024
To clear the stage, Raora must strike 5 poses at the marked spots within the time limit!

214
00:15:54,024 --> 00:15:56,524
Oh, sounds easy, right?

215
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:57,624
I got it!

216
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,024
It sounds so much fun! Let's go!

217
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:01,824
Yeah, but it's not going to be easy.

218
00:16:01,824 --> 00:16:07,224
Yeah, it's not going to be easy because we're going to be taking part as well and I'm going to get in your way.

219
00:16:07,224 --> 00:16:13,024
No! All up in your business! All up in your... I'm gonna get in your way!

220
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:21,024
I'm gonna get the ticket, I'm gonna win!

221
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:22,524
No!

222
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,024
I guess that means we're all going to get into it super close.

223
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,524
Loser! Raora loser!

224
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:29,524
No, I'm not a loser! You loser!

225
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:31,024
No, no, no!

226
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:33,524
Well, I feel like everyone's confident! No you aren't! Hurry up!

227
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:35,524
A little too confident. No, don't worry, no, it's okay, it's all good, it's all good.

228
00:16:35,524 --> 00:16:40,024
What is it? I'm striking a pose, it's a pose game! It's a pose game!

229
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:44,824
Got it, got it! Yeah! Oh! Okay!

230
00:16:44,824 --> 00:16:47,024
Are you guys excited?

231
00:16:47,024 --> 00:16:48,024
I'm excited!

232
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:50,524
Okay, if everybody's ready then...

233
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:52,024
Let's do this!

234
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:56,024
Whoo! Let's do it!

235
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:04,224
Hope you're all ready, troops! Are you guys excited?

236
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,524
Yeah!!

237
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:09,024
Get ready to start voguing!

238
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:13,024
Since it would be a shame to go straight into the real thing, let us do some practice first, okay?

239
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:15,524
Mmm, okay, okay! Let's do it!

240
00:17:15,524 --> 00:17:17,524
All righty, so here we go.

241
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:19,524
Three, two, one, start!

242
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:25,024
Okay, let's see. First camera... Here, here! Hey, hey, hey!

243
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:33,524
I'm sorry! I shouldn't have stepped back! No, no, no!

244
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:35,024
Okay, what is it?

245
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:37,024
Yeah! Yeah!

246
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:44,524
Okay, uh... Okay, let's see.

247
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:48,024
Next one... Yes, yes! This is Calliope's time to shine!

248
00:17:51,524 --> 00:17:53,024
Okay, uh, where?

249
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:54,524
Hey! One more!

250
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:04,524
Whoa! Oh! Where? Where? Where? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

251
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:06,524
Aha!

252
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,524
Dang it! Time's up!

253
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:20,024
You doing okay there, buddy?

254
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:21,024
That was so good!

255
00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:24,024
I will touch you and I will hurt you.

256
00:18:24,024 --> 00:18:27,024
Just so we're all on the same page, I will hurt you if I have to.

257
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,024
Hurt me!

258
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,524
I love it!

259
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:31,024
That's not the response I expected.

260
00:18:31,024 --> 00:18:33,024
Well, I'm fine with it!

261
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:35,524
Shall we move on to the main event, ladies?

262
00:18:35,524 --> 00:18:37,024
Okay! Yes!

263
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:42,524
Okay. The time limit for the main event is two minutes. Whoever strikes the right pose in the required spots most is the winner.

264
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:44,524
Now then,

265
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:47,024
let's get this show on the road. Three,

266
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:48,524
two,

267
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:50,524
one,

268
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:52,024
Ikuzo!
Let's go!

269
00:18:52,024 --> 00:18:54,024
Start! Let's go!

270
00:18:56,524 --> 00:18:58,024
Where is it?

271
00:18:58,024 --> 00:19:01,024
Whoa!

272
00:19:01,024 --> 00:19:04,024
That was kind of nutty! Let's go!

273
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:07,024
Let's go! What is it?

274
00:19:07,024 --> 00:19:12,024
No, no, no, no, no! No! Yeah!

275
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:14,024
You guys are too good at this! Let's go!

276
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:18,524
Oh man, I'm going to get injured!

277
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:22,524
No! Away! You hurt me! Dang it!

278
00:19:22,524 --> 00:19:24,524
Next one is mine!

279
00:19:24,524 --> 00:19:27,524
What do you think? As I said, I will hurt you.

280
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:31,024
No! Raora! No!

281
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:39,024
Man, everyone's so good.

282
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:41,024
I know! At, you know, hurting each other.

283
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:43,024
Dang it!

284
00:19:48,024 --> 00:19:49,524
Oh my god! Oh my god!

285
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:51,524
What is it?

286
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:56,524
No, no, no, no, no! Stop! No!

287
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:59,024
大丈夫先輩？大丈夫ですか？
Are you okay, senpai? Are you okay?

288
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,832
It's okay, it's okay!

289
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:06,532
Points!

290
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,832
Why is she so strong?

291
00:20:10,132 --> 00:20:12,332
She's rejecting all of my pushes!

292
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:17,432
MISSED!

293
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:21,032
Okay. Oh man. Really blocking...

294
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:25,532
Man, I'm not even gonna try on this one.

295
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,532
Points!

296
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:32,432
Wow, they're all squabbling.

297
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,232
Calliope takes the lead.

298
00:20:35,832 --> 00:20:37,432
Points!

299
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:37,832
That's so tiring!

300
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:41,232
No, not every time.

301
00:20:41,232 --> 00:20:43,032
You can't get it every time, Kronii.

302
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:45,332
Points!

303
00:20:45,432 --> 00:20:46,832
Come on!

304
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:50,832
Let me have this one!

305
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:52,332
MISSED!

306
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:54,332
TIME'S UP!

307
00:20:55,932 --> 00:20:58,232
おいおいおい。めっちゃ疲れた。
Oi oi oi. That's so tiring.

308
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:00,632
Yo, why are y'all so strong?

309
00:21:00,832 --> 00:21:02,132
I don't get it.

310
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:12,632
We are good. We are good. Oh, okay, so good.

311
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:18,532
Man, I feel like we just came out of a battle.

312
00:21:21,832 --> 00:21:23,232
Raora!

313
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:24,832
I'm good.

314
00:21:25,432 --> 00:21:29,532
いい勝負。That's what I call a good match.
A good match. That's what I call a good match.

315
00:21:29,732 --> 00:21:31,232
Okay, okay. How was it?

316
00:21:31,732 --> 00:21:33,132
Yo, how do you guys think that you did?

317
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:34,432
I think I won.

318
00:21:34,932 --> 00:21:36,532
I think I won. Me too.

319
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:38,932
Oh, no, no, no. We won.

320
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,532
I think Kronii won. With the sheer force of
her muscles pushing people out of the way.

321
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:45,332
I'm so sorry! But it wasn't even that.

322
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:46,432
She could not be pushed.

323
00:21:46,432 --> 00:21:49,832
I mean, hey, you know what, competitive spirit.
I can't even argue with that.

324
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:53,632
Well then. Well done everyone. Well done.

325
00:21:54,332 --> 00:21:57,232
Well, let's see how that weighs up
against the results, shall we?

326
00:21:57,432 --> 00:21:58,732
Yay!

327
00:21:59,032 --> 00:22:01,032
I bet I am the winner.

328
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:04,232
No, no, no, Raora, no, Raora, no, Raora...

329
00:22:04,232 --> 00:22:05,832
Yes, Raora, yes, Raora, I'm the winner.

330
00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:07,432
Me me me win.

331
00:22:07,432 --> 00:22:10,032
Yes, Kronii, yes, let me win, me me me win.

332
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:13,232
All right, all right, let's see how we all did then.
Here we go.

333
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:15,332
Okay, drumroll please. Drumroll.

334
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:23,032
Kronii! No! Raora!

335
00:22:25,532 --> 00:22:29,232
That's crazy close. She's too strong. Man.

336
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,632
Congrats, congrats!

337
00:22:31,732 --> 00:22:34,532
I knew it anyway. Thank you, thank you.

338
00:22:34,532 --> 00:22:37,832
There was no defeating the... the clock of steel.

339
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,832
This is rigged! It's rigged!

340
00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:43,932
She's too good, Raora. She can't be beaten.

341
00:22:43,932 --> 00:22:47,032
I tried to pick her up and move her and
she just can't be... she can't be moved.

342
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,032
She's immovable. Man, it's really too bad though.

343
00:22:50,132 --> 00:22:54,032
I was gonna give you the ticket if you managed
to win, but oh well, this round's a bust.

344
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:56,532
All boo, so sad. Oh, I cry.

345
00:22:56,532 --> 00:22:58,532
Oh no... Wait, wait, Mori, wait a second.

346
00:22:58,532 --> 00:23:02,532
There must be a way, right? I need the ticket.
I need to clear all the games.

347
00:23:02,532 --> 00:23:04,532
I mean... Please, please.

348
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:08,532
It's not... it's not up to me, but you know what,
what to do? I feel kind of bad, you're my cute kouhai.

349
00:23:08,532 --> 00:23:12,532
Please! ころね先輩、ころね先輩どうすればいい？
Please! Korone-senpai, Korone-senpai, what should I do?

350
00:23:12,532 --> 00:23:15,532
や、そうね。Do you like Japanese TV show?
Yeah, let's see. Do you like Japanese TV shows?

351
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:17,532
Yes, I love Japanese TV shows, yes.

352
00:23:18,032 --> 00:23:20,532
あ、ぷりーずキュートおねだり。
Ah, please do a 'cute plea'.

353
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:24,532
へ？おねだり？可愛くおねだり？
You want me to beg?
Huh? A plea? A cute plea?
You want me to beg?

354
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:27,532
や。おねだり。あ、このカメラ、おっけー？
このカメラ。
Yeah. A plea. Ah, this camera, okay?
This camera.

355
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,532
ちょっと低い、ちょっと低く。
A bit low, a bit lower.

356
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:34,532
Get kind of low, like you're about to make it...
Okay, up eyes, up eyes, okay?

357
00:23:34,532 --> 00:23:41,532
がんばれ！Do your best. Cute face, cute face, okay?
Cute face. I can't wait. おねだり。キュートおねだり。
Do your best! Do your best. Cute face, cute face, okay?
Cute face. I can't wait. A plea. A cute plea.

358
00:23:42,532 --> 00:23:45,532
Raora's Cute Plea

359
00:23:46,532 --> 00:23:49,532
All right, three, two, one, action!

360
00:23:50,032 --> 00:23:55,032
Please... Please, Korone-senpai.
Please... onedari.
Please... Please, Korone-senpai.
Please... my plea.

361
00:23:56,032 --> 00:24:02,032
Please give me the ticket. Please, I need the ticket.
Please, please Korone-senpai, お願いします。
Please give me the ticket. Please, I need the ticket.
Please, please Korone-senpai, I beg you.

362
00:24:03,032 --> 00:24:10,032
Please, please give me the ticket.
Oh man, I feel so bad now. I need the ticket.

363
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:17,832
そこまでやるとは…。All right, all right, since
she's done enough, you've done enough...
To go as far as this... All right, all right, since
she's done enough, you've done enough...

364
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:21,832
そんなに欲しいのね。All right, all right, all right
Raora, you've done it! Look, the ticket!
You want it that much, huh. All right, all right, all right
Raora, you've done it! Look, the ticket!

365
00:24:21,832 --> 00:24:24,832
Look at your hand, look at your hand!
The ticket! I got the ticket! Great job!

366
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:28,032
Got the Ticket!!

367
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:29,032
Excellent! やった！Cute onedari.
Excellent! I did it! A cute plea.

368
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:33,532
Okay, there you go. I got the ticket! Let's go!

369
00:24:34,032 --> 00:24:38,532
Well done. See, no problem. Happy ending. Happy end.

370
00:24:39,032 --> 00:24:42,532
Now, you will receive the Jetpack Chatini if you
gather three tickets. Count them, three.

371
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:46,532
So good luck on the next games as well.

372
00:24:47,032 --> 00:24:51,532
Thank you, senpais! Thank you! Yeah, no problem.
Thank you so much! Now go do your best!

373
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:55,532
Okay, I'll do my best! Thank you so much!
Bye bye! Bye bye!

374
00:24:56,032 --> 00:25:00,032
This way! This way! I'll go this way! Yay!

375
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,073
This way! Go straight!

376
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:01,940
Go straight!

377
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,506
This way, this way!

378
00:25:03,506 --> 00:25:04,306
Let's go!

379
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:07,406
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

380
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,606
Good luck!

381
00:25:08,606 --> 00:25:09,640
See you!

382
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,473
Bye-bye! See ya!

383
00:25:12,806 --> 00:25:16,873
Chattini Land Jungle Area

384
00:25:22,173 --> 00:25:26,540
Oh my gosh, this area is really different
from the last one!

385
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,206
It's super dark!

386
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:30,840
And... what's with all the bars?

387
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:35,373
It's... it's kind of scary.

388
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:38,240
(mysterious singing)

389
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,473
What is that?

390
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:41,040
I hear voices!

391
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:44,240
A-go? What is that?

392
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,373
Oh my gosh! Moona!

393
00:25:48,373 --> 00:25:50,173
Please, Goddess Moona!

394
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,473
Please, my time has come!

395
00:25:52,473 --> 00:25:53,640
Please take my soul!

396
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,606
Are those... Nerissa and Moona?

397
00:25:56,606 --> 00:25:59,373
Yeah, you're gonna say
you don't recognize us?

398
00:25:59,373 --> 00:26:02,340
Of course I recognize you!

399
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,640
Oh my gosh!

400
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,540
Congratulations on your 3D!

401
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,573
Thank you! I'm so happy!

402
00:26:10,573 --> 00:26:11,806
Finally!

403
00:26:11,806 --> 00:26:13,473
Thank you!

404
00:26:13,473 --> 00:26:15,573
I think we have to introduce!

405
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,873
Of course!

406
00:26:16,873 --> 00:26:18,206
Starting from me!

407
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:21,073
Hello everyone!
I am Moona Hoshinova...

408
00:26:21,073 --> 00:26:24,440
...from hololive Indonesia Generation 1!

409
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,206
And...

410
00:26:26,206 --> 00:26:28,206
Hiya, darlings!

411
00:26:28,206 --> 00:26:31,106
This is hololive English -Advent-'s
devilish diva...

412
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:33,473
...the one and only, Nerissa Ravencroft!

413
00:26:33,473 --> 00:26:35,373
Thank you for having me!

414
00:26:35,373 --> 00:26:39,140
Thank you so much for being here!

415
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,873
We came here to bring a game.

416
00:26:41,873 --> 00:26:43,206
A game!

417
00:26:43,206 --> 00:26:44,273
Really?

418
00:26:44,273 --> 00:26:46,440
Yes, it involves cooperation.

419
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,906
Oh, good! What are we gonna do?

420
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:51,573
Well, the game this time is...

421
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,240
One...

422
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,973
...two...

423
00:26:55,973 --> 00:26:57,106
...three...

424
00:26:57,106 --> 00:27:00,206
Limbo Dance! Panthera!!

425
00:27:00,206 --> 00:27:03,240
Limbo Dance! Panthera!!

426
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,140
The rules are super simple.

427
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,240
The three of us are
gonna do some sexy limbo dance.

428
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:29,840
Make your way to the stage while doing the limbo!
To clear the stage, Raora must end
with a cool musical performance on stage!

429
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,273
Dancing, yes! The limbo dance, dancing!

430
00:27:13,273 --> 00:27:16,873
As we make our way towards the stage!

431
00:27:16,873 --> 00:27:19,006
So exciting!

432
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:22,940
Me too! And once we're there,
there's one thing left to do.

433
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:26,606
We're all gonna sing a super awesome trio song!

434
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,973
Sounds simple, right?

435
00:27:30,973 --> 00:27:34,240
Simple, let's see. I am born for this! Let's go!

436
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,440
But you know... are we really
gonna be able to do this?

437
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,473
I think we might have not
thought ahead too far.

438
00:27:43,473 --> 00:27:45,373
Of course we're gonna do it!

439
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:48,573
No, but you know... we all have something...

440
00:27:48,573 --> 00:27:51,406
...that I feel like will make limbo
a little bit difficult.

441
00:27:51,406 --> 00:27:54,206
Don't worry, Nerissa! Something that is really hard...

442
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:57,206
...but it's fine! We can do it!

443
00:27:57,206 --> 00:27:59,073
Save it for the game, ladies!

444
00:27:59,073 --> 00:28:00,706
Okay! Let's do it!

445
00:28:00,706 --> 00:28:04,206
First off, though, we need to do some warm-up.

446
00:28:04,906 --> 00:28:10,106
Yes! Yes! Keep going girls!

447
00:28:14,406 --> 00:28:18,973
Let's warm up a little bit before the game now!

448
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,740
Can They Clear It?!

449
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,940
Right, that's us ready, all together! Yes!

450
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,773
I took off my jacket because it's so hot in here!

451
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:38,306
Can you do me a favor?

452
00:28:38,306 --> 00:28:40,873
Could you jump a little bit more? Just a little bit.

453
00:28:40,873 --> 00:28:42,540
Why are you asking?

454
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,006
Yes, like that! I love jumping so let's go!

455
00:28:46,006 --> 00:28:49,040
And look at those shoulders too! Show those off!

456
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,406
Very nice! Thank you!

457
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,640
Oh my god! I'm gonna do my very
best in limbo dance!

458
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,906
Let's dance! Let's do it!

459
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:02,206
Let's get the music going!

460
00:29:02,206 --> 00:29:05,206
GAME START!

461
00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:07,606
Nice music, do you hear that?

462
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:08,806
Are you ready?

463
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:14,340
6 Limbo left!!

464
00:29:08,806 --> 00:29:10,173
I'm ready!

465
00:29:10,173 --> 00:29:12,673
It's your 3D debut, so get going!

466
00:29:12,673 --> 00:29:16,140
Well, that's too easy for me! Are you guys ready?

467
00:29:17,373 --> 00:29:19,506
Here we go! Yay!

468
00:29:19,506 --> 00:29:21,506
GOOD!

469
00:29:21,506 --> 00:29:23,040
I'm going next!

470
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,440
Moona!

471
00:29:25,906 --> 00:29:27,506
Too easy for her!

472
00:29:27,506 --> 00:29:28,506
Nerissa!

473
00:29:28,506 --> 00:29:30,606
You can do it!

474
00:29:30,606 --> 00:29:33,340
Oh my god! Easy peasy!

475
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,506
Who's next?

476
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:35,873
Same order!

477
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:38,240
Let's keep it going! That's a bit unfair.

478
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,006
Well, I'm gonna do it then!

479
00:29:40,006 --> 00:29:41,940
Show us how it's done!

480
00:29:43,106 --> 00:29:44,840
Good job! Okay!

481
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,840
I can do it! Easy, easy!

482
00:29:47,373 --> 00:29:50,040
Look at you go!

483
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,340
This is a little bit more difficult.

484
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,006
Maybe same order?

485
00:30:00,148 --> 00:30:00,948
Senpai order!

486
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:02,348
I can do it for you guys.

487
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:03,848
Okay.

488
00:30:03,948 --> 00:30:04,648
Whoo!

489
00:30:04,748 --> 00:30:06,548
Whoa! Oh, look at her go!

490
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:09,548
Look at her go! Good!

491
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:11,848
Next up is...

492
00:30:12,448 --> 00:30:14,048
watch how it's done.

493
00:30:14,248 --> 00:30:15,548
Show me, Queen!

494
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:17,448
Whoa!

495
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:19,448
That's so clean, girl! Good!

496
00:30:19,548 --> 00:30:21,048
Let's go, my turn.

497
00:30:21,548 --> 00:30:23,048
Definitely gonna do it.

498
00:30:23,148 --> 00:30:24,548
Come on, Kohai.

499
00:30:25,048 --> 00:30:28,048
Ha! Oh, oh! Success!

500
00:30:28,148 --> 00:30:31,048
Good! So good!

501
00:30:32,048 --> 00:30:34,548
Okay, maybe... switch it off, I'll go first.

502
00:30:34,648 --> 00:30:35,548
Yes, you go.

503
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:39,048
Oh my goodness! Perfect!

504
00:30:39,148 --> 00:30:41,248
She's nailing it.

505
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:42,548
Are you gonna be able to do it, Moona?

506
00:30:42,648 --> 00:30:43,748
You can do it, Moona.

507
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:45,048
I believe!

508
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:45,848
I can do it.

509
00:30:46,048 --> 00:30:47,048
This is a tough one.

510
00:30:47,148 --> 00:30:52,048
Can do it... Oh! Oh! Success!

511
00:30:52,148 --> 00:30:53,548
You actually did it!

512
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:56,048
All right, my turn.

513
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:58,048
Let me show you all my skills.

514
00:30:58,548 --> 00:31:00,048
You can do it, Raora.

515
00:31:00,548 --> 00:31:04,048
Ha! Oh! Fail?

516
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:07,548
Oh no! Oh good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

517
00:31:08,048 --> 00:31:09,548
Yeah, you're okay, you're okay.

518
00:31:09,648 --> 00:31:11,248
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

519
00:31:11,348 --> 00:31:14,048
No, we have to keep going. There's still two more.

520
00:31:14,148 --> 00:31:16,248
Oh, all right. Right.

521
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:18,548
Let me rest a little bit.

522
00:31:18,648 --> 00:31:21,048
Oh my god. I'm too old for this.

523
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:23,048
Come on, grandma. Come on.

524
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:25,548
You have no idea of the game.

525
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:28,048
Two more lines, grandma. Two more.

526
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:30,048
Come on, come on. Let's go.

527
00:31:30,548 --> 00:31:32,048
We have two more to go, right?

528
00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:33,248
Wait a second.

529
00:31:33,348 --> 00:31:34,548
You dropped yours!

530
00:31:35,048 --> 00:31:36,548
Oh no, damn.

531
00:31:36,648 --> 00:31:39,048
Well, I think I'm done with these two then.

532
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,548
Oh, poor it.

533
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,548
I think I still can do this for now.

534
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:44,248
Time to get serious.

535
00:31:44,348 --> 00:31:45,548
So I'm gonna lock in.

536
00:31:46,048 --> 00:31:48,048
This is impossible, hello?

537
00:31:48,148 --> 00:31:50,048
Yeah, it's a little bit low, but I think we can do it.

538
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:52,548
Okay, I'll try first.

539
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:55,548
Whoa! Amazing!

540
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:57,548
She's too good, Moona.

541
00:31:57,648 --> 00:31:59,048
I don't know if I can do it.

542
00:31:59,148 --> 00:32:01,048
Oh my god. Oh my god.

543
00:32:01,548 --> 00:32:02,548
Come on. You can do it.

544
00:32:02,648 --> 00:32:03,548
You can do it.

545
00:32:03,648 --> 00:32:06,548
Come on, Moona, Moona, Moona!

546
00:32:07,048 --> 00:32:08,548
No, I think I have an idea.

547
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:10,048
She got an idea!

548
00:32:10,548 --> 00:32:15,548
Whoa! Good? Success!

549
00:32:16,048 --> 00:32:18,048
This strategy. The power of Breadman!

550
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:21,548
Let's see.

551
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,048
You can do it.

552
00:32:23,148 --> 00:32:24,548
Come on, Raora. You got this.

553
00:32:25,548 --> 00:32:27,548
Okay, I think I can do it.

554
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:32,048
Whoa! Good? Success!

555
00:32:33,048 --> 00:32:35,048
That's great! That's really nice.

556
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:38,548
Okay, I don't think I can... I don't know if I can do this one.

557
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:41,548
I mean, you did so good so far.

558
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:43,048
You can do it.

559
00:32:43,148 --> 00:32:44,248
You can do it.

560
00:32:44,348 --> 00:32:45,548
One more.

561
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:48,048
I think I'm too tall for this one. Help me.

562
00:32:48,148 --> 00:32:50,048
I'm gonna hold you. I'm gonna fall. I'm gonna fall.

563
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:54,048
Oh! Yeah! I did it! Success!

564
00:32:55,048 --> 00:32:56,548
I'm going to follow their way.

565
00:32:57,048 --> 00:32:59,048
I'm going to follow her way.

566
00:32:59,548 --> 00:33:01,048
Let's do this.

567
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:03,548
Moona, we're gonna put it...

568
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,548
Oh, now she's getting serious.

569
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,548
She's getting serious.

570
00:33:08,548 --> 00:33:17,048
Ha! Whoo! Oh my goodness! Success!

571
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:20,548
Okay, okay.

572
00:33:21,048 --> 00:33:23,048
Then it's my turn now. How, what to do?

573
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:28,048
Well, I'm a big cat, so...

574
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,048
Nyan nyan nyan!

575
00:33:31,148 --> 00:33:34,548
So cute! Whoo!

576
00:33:35,548 --> 00:33:36,548
Thank you.

577
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,048
Here we go.

578
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:43,048
Well, I still think we have one more obstacle yet before us.

579
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:44,248
Where, where?

580
00:33:44,348 --> 00:33:45,548
Up this slope.

581
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:47,048
Oh, let's go.

582
00:33:47,148 --> 00:33:48,548
We've got to go up.

583
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:49,848
All right, everyone.

584
00:33:50,048 --> 00:33:51,548
Don't forget our limbo dance.

585
00:33:52,048 --> 00:33:53,548
Oh yeah, the limbo dance now.

586
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:55,048
Whoo!

587
00:33:55,148 --> 00:33:56,548
Yes! Let's go to the stage.

588
00:33:57,048 --> 00:33:58,548
Whoo!

589
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:01,048
Are you guys excited?

590
00:34:02,048 --> 00:34:03,548
So excited! I am so ready!

591
00:34:04,048 --> 00:34:05,548
Whoo!

592
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,548
Oh, that was so hard.

593
00:34:13,048 --> 00:34:14,548
Yeah, but we did it.

594
00:34:15,048 --> 00:34:16,548
To the stage already.

595
00:34:17,048 --> 00:34:18,048
Yeah, we're here.

596
00:34:18,148 --> 00:34:19,048
You're right. Here.

597
00:34:19,148 --> 00:34:21,048
Oh my god. Are you ready for this?

598
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:22,548
Okay.

599
00:34:23,048 --> 00:34:24,048
I don't know what I'm doing, but let's do it.

600
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:26,048
We gotta go full power mode.

601
00:34:26,548 --> 00:34:27,548
Yeah!

602
00:34:28,048 --> 00:34:30,048
All right, last part.

603
00:34:47,548 --> 00:34:48,448
捕まえちゃう！
I'll catch you!

604
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:49,748
どこにいるの？
Where are you?

605
00:34:49,848 --> 00:34:51,248
ムリよムリよ
It's impossible, impossible

606
00:34:51,348 --> 00:34:53,248
どこにいたってムリよ
Wherever you are, it's impossible

607
00:34:53,348 --> 00:34:54,048
捕まえちゃう！
I'll catch you!

608
00:34:54,148 --> 00:34:55,148
だれといるの？
Who are you with?

609
00:34:55,248 --> 00:34:56,748
ダメよダメよ
No way, no way

610
00:34:56,848 --> 00:34:59,048
わたし以外はダメよ
No one except for me

611
00:35:00,746 --> 00:35:02,856
甘いよ甘い そんな装備じゃ
It's naive, so naive, with that gear of yours

612
00:35:02,856 --> 00:35:05,156
逃げられるわけ 無いじゃないか
There's no way you can escape, is there?

613
00:35:05,656 --> 00:35:08,256
狙いをつけて 密かに
Taking aim, quietly,

614
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:10,556
背後から
from behind...

615
00:35:10,956 --> 00:35:13,356
I love you

616
00:35:13,756 --> 00:35:16,856
私のことを 好きになるはず
You're bound to fall for me

617
00:35:16,956 --> 00:35:19,456
I love you

618
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:22,056
そこに正義が あるの
That's where justice lies

619
00:35:22,256 --> 00:35:24,056
何度も言わせるつもりなの？
How many times are you going to make me say it?

620
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:27,056
おやおや 抵抗するなら してごらん！
My my, if you're going to resist, just try it!

621
00:35:27,256 --> 00:35:30,356
意外と 我が儘だと 知ってるけれど
I know I'm unexpectedly selfish, but

622
00:35:30,556 --> 00:35:33,256
私の方が 上手なようね
It seems I've got the upper hand

623
00:35:33,456 --> 00:35:36,456
冷たい言葉 優しい視線
Cold words, a gentle gaze

624
00:35:36,556 --> 00:35:39,856
獲物は... 君だよ！
The prey is... you!

625
00:35:40,456 --> 00:35:46,056
Cutie Panther 私 どこでも 行くよ
Cutie Panther, I'll go anywhere

626
00:35:46,556 --> 00:35:51,856
君の君の君の 心盗んでみせるよ

629
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:17,456
熱いよ熱い 愛のルールは
Hot, so hot, the rules of love

630
00:36:17,656 --> 00:36:20,256
破られるため 在るんだよ
Exist to be broken

631
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:25,456
ずるい罠へと 誘う 微笑みは
A smile that lures you into a cunning trap

632
00:36:25,856 --> 00:36:31,556
I miss you 好きのせいだし 悪くないでしょ
I miss you, it's because of love, so it's not bad, right?

635
00:36:39,056 --> 00:36:42,156

My my, if you're going to resist, just try it!

636
00:36:42,356 --> 00:36:45,756
てこわい 偽りだって 疑うよりも
Rather than doubting it's a formidable lie

637
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:48,356
私のこと信じてみてよ
Try believing in me

638

655
00:38:33,256 --> 00:38:38,256
どこにいるの 無理よ無理よ どこにいたって無理よ
Where are you? It's no use, no use, no matter where you are it's no use

656
00:38:38,256 --> 00:38:39,456
捕まえちゃう！
I'm gonna catch you!

657
00:38:39,456 --> 00:38:44,256
だれといるの ダメよダメよ 私以外はダメよ
Who are you with? No, no, anyone but me is no good

658
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:45,456
捕まえちゃう！
I'm gonna catch you!

659
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:50,156
どこにいるの 無理よ無理よ どこにいたって無理よ
Where are you? It's no use, no use, no matter where you are it's no use

660
00:38:50,156 --> 00:38:51,256
捕まえちゃう！
I'm gonna catch you!

661
00:38:51,256 --> 00:38:56,256
だれといるの ダメよダメよ 私以外はダメよ
Who are you with? No, no, anyone but me is no good

662
00:39:12,156 --> 00:39:15,556
How was that, Velvet?

663
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:16,756
That's really nice.

664
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:18,556
That's how Velvet does it.

665
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,056
So cool, right?

666
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:22,756
So together. Nice!

667
00:39:22,856 --> 00:39:24,556
So happy!

668
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:28,956
Thank you for dancing and singing with me.

669
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:32,956
Ooh, and also, since we already finished our session,

670
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:35,556
so here's your ticket!

671
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:41,856
Oh my god! I got it! Look at you! CLEAR!

672
00:39:37,356 --> 00:39:41,056
Got the Ticket!!

673
00:39:41,956 --> 00:39:44,156
Congratulations Raora!

674
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:47,256
One more left now.

675
00:39:47,356 --> 00:39:48,556
Let's go!

676
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:51,556
Thank you so much! I'm so happy!

677
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:54,056
It was so fun. Thank you for having us.

678
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:55,456
Thank you!

679
00:39:55,556 --> 00:39:58,156
Good luck getting that final ticket too, alright?

680
00:39:58,256 --> 00:39:58,956
Yes, that's true.

681
00:39:59,056 --> 00:40:00,056
Oh, true!

682
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,364
I'll do my best.

683
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:02,564
I'll do my best, I promise!

684
00:40:02,964 --> 00:40:04,164
Thank you girls!

685
00:40:04,264 --> 00:40:05,464
You can do it!

686
00:40:06,164 --> 00:40:08,564
Well, as for us, we should take our leave now.

687
00:40:09,164 --> 00:40:09,964
Bye bye!

688
00:40:10,064 --> 00:40:11,264
We must leave you here.

689
00:40:11,364 --> 00:40:12,764
No! Don't leave me girls!

690
00:40:12,864 --> 00:40:13,964
We need to go.

691
00:40:14,964 --> 00:40:16,164
Nooo!

692
00:40:18,564 --> 00:40:23,564
The limbo dance was so hard that it
became their default walking stage.

693
00:40:27,064 --> 00:40:34,064
Chattini Land Sci-Fi

694
00:40:36,564 --> 00:40:39,864
Oh! What is this place?

695
00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:46,864
Oh my god, this seems like this space came out of
a science fiction movie or something like that.

696
00:40:47,664 --> 00:40:52,564
But now I'm curious, what kind of game
they got prepared for me this time? Hmm...

697
00:40:54,264 --> 00:41:05,164
(Howling) Raora! Raora!

698
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,064
I smell something...

699
00:41:09,664 --> 00:41:14,364
Dog smell! I know who you are. Come out! Come here!

700
00:41:16,264 --> 00:41:18,464
Raora!

701
00:41:23,264 --> 00:41:31,064
Oh, Come here! Come here! Come here!
Oh wow! Yeah! There, there, there, there...

702
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,264
Raora!

703
00:41:46,864 --> 00:41:49,864
I'm so excited, I'm so nervous, I'm so happy!

704
00:41:51,264 --> 00:41:52,864
Your tail's looking really happy too!

705
00:41:53,664 --> 00:41:56,564
No, no, no, no... Okay, let's talk about it.

706
00:41:58,564 --> 00:42:02,364
There's a game to the right! Yeah, that's the game, right?

707
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:06,564
Wait, but why don't you guys introduce yourselves?

708
00:42:07,864 --> 00:42:11,064
I'm not Mococo, I'm Fuwawa Abyssgard!

709
00:42:11,764 --> 00:42:14,564
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Mococo!

710
00:42:15,564 --> 00:42:17,364
Together we are...

711
00:42:17,464 --> 00:42:20,564
FuwaMoco! Bau Bau!

712
00:42:21,864 --> 00:42:25,264
And I'm not FuwaMoco! Bau Bau! I'm...

713
00:42:25,864 --> 00:42:33,564
...Koseki Bijou, sparkling gem of
Hololive English Advent! Kira kira, Koseki!

714
00:42:39,164 --> 00:42:40,864
And then...

715
00:42:40,964 --> 00:42:46,864
Rau! It's still me, Raora Panthera from
Hololive English Justice, this time in 3D!

716
00:42:50,564 --> 00:42:53,564
Wait, have I introduced myself before?
I'm not sure about that. Maybe.

717
00:42:54,664 --> 00:42:58,564
Always good for having more! It's okay, it's okay!

718
00:42:59,864 --> 00:43:02,564
So, what's the last game gonna be?

719
00:43:03,564 --> 00:43:07,564
Wait for this next game! Actually, Raora...

720
00:43:08,864 --> 00:43:11,564
...you're the only one in this challenge!

721
00:43:12,564 --> 00:43:13,864
Wait, what do you mean?

722
00:43:14,264 --> 00:43:16,864
But we have a very important role too, right?

723
00:43:17,464 --> 00:43:18,864
Wait, what are you guys gonna do?

724
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:21,864
We're gonna... stop you!

725
00:43:22,064 --> 00:43:24,564
No, no, no, no, no! You guys gotta let me win!

726
00:43:25,164 --> 00:43:26,764
We're gonna be mean!

727
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:32,364
No, no, no, no, you gotta let me win! It's my debut!
And it's the last ticket, I need it!

728
00:43:33,264 --> 00:43:37,564
No, no, I don't think so. We're gonna
put you through the wringer, yeah!

729
00:43:38,264 --> 00:43:41,564
Are you ready to hear what the third
final game is? It is...

730
00:43:42,564 --> 00:43:48,564
One, two, three... Run! Run! Raora!!

731
00:43:50,564 --> 00:43:53,564
Run! Run! Raora!!

732
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:56,564
Oh, okay, okay. What's the rules?

733
00:43:57,064 --> 00:43:58,864
Okay, are you curious?

734
00:43:58,964 --> 00:43:59,664
I'm very curious!

735
00:44:00,064 --> 00:44:02,564
Take a look at the conveyor belt behind you!

736
00:44:03,864 --> 00:44:07,264
What is this? Uh, there is nothing on it, Bijou.

737
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:10,564
Oh, silly me! There is something on it. Bring it out!

738
00:44:11,864 --> 00:44:12,864
What is that? Huh?

739
00:44:13,564 --> 00:44:16,364
Eww! What is... eww! Is that a pizza?

740
00:44:16,864 --> 00:44:20,364
Pineapple pizza! Broken up spaghetti! Get out of here!

741
00:44:17,064 --> 00:44:20,564
Pineapple pizza

742
00:44:21,064 --> 00:44:25,564
Pasta with ketchup! No, no, no!

743
00:44:21,064 --> 00:44:25,864
Broken up spaghetti

744
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:30,564
Ketchup spaghetti

745
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:31,564
Eww! No, thank you! I'm done with this!
I'm so done! I'm leaving! I'm leaving!

746
00:44:32,064 --> 00:44:34,564
Raora, you have to stay!

747
00:44:32,064 --> 00:44:36,264
No, I'm not gonna play this game!

748
00:44:36,564 --> 00:44:39,564
No, I'm not gonna play this game! It's too much for me!

749
00:44:40,264 --> 00:44:45,564
No! No, no, no! It's too much for me! I'm done with this!

750
00:44:46,564 --> 00:44:51,564
Well, do you notice that everything we
brought out here is everything you hate?

751
00:44:52,264 --> 00:44:54,864
Do you hate pineapple pizza, Raora?

752
00:44:55,864 --> 00:45:00,064
To clear the stage, Raora must dodge all the
incoming obstacles during the time limit!

753
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,172
And avoid everything! That's it!

754
00:45:02,172 --> 00:45:03,272
Yup, yup, yup!

755
00:45:03,272 --> 00:45:05,572
No, no, no, you can do it!

756
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:08,572
Wait a second. And why you guys are here then?

757
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:10,572
What you guys gonna do?

758
00:45:10,572 --> 00:45:14,572
Well... we'll be using certain things...

759
00:45:14,572 --> 00:45:17,572
...to make life more difficult!

760
00:45:17,572 --> 00:45:19,572
Oh, you can't do this to me!

761
00:45:19,572 --> 00:45:22,072
Hehe, yup. No.

762
00:45:22,072 --> 00:45:25,072
You, you are really a criminal!

763
00:45:26,572 --> 00:45:29,072
No, no, you're not gonna do this to me!

764
00:45:29,072 --> 00:45:31,572
Wait, wait, wait, wait, okay, okay, okay!

765
00:45:31,572 --> 00:45:33,572
Wait, we'll be right back! We'll be right back!

766
00:45:33,572 --> 00:45:36,572
No, no, don't leave me! Hey!

767
00:45:36,572 --> 00:45:38,572
What you gonna do?

768
00:45:38,572 --> 00:45:41,572
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

769
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,072
RAORA! RAORA!

770
00:45:54,072 --> 00:45:57,072
Okay, okay, I will play the game!

771
00:45:57,072 --> 00:45:59,572
You have to play the game!

772
00:46:00,072 --> 00:46:03,572
Okay, I will play the game! Hahaha!

773
00:46:03,572 --> 00:46:06,572
Did you like that? 'Cause there's more!

774
00:46:06,572 --> 00:46:09,572
No, don't touch me with that onion! Ugh!

775
00:46:09,572 --> 00:46:11,072
It's bigger than you, Biboo!

776
00:46:11,072 --> 00:46:13,572
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?

777
00:46:13,572 --> 00:46:15,572
I'm bigger than this onion, hey!

778
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:17,572
Cucumbers are good, right? Yum!

779
00:46:18,072 --> 00:46:21,072
Now, let's get going here!

780
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,572
Let's go!

781
00:46:26,572 --> 00:46:28,572
Onion! Yay!

782
00:46:29,072 --> 00:46:31,572
Are you okay? I'm fine.

783
00:46:32,072 --> 00:46:36,572
Raora's Fate?!

784
00:46:38,072 --> 00:46:40,572
Okay! You ready, Raora?

785
00:46:40,572 --> 00:46:44,072
Um... no, so... hey, hey, guys!

786
00:46:44,072 --> 00:46:48,572
Wait, wait, guys, can we play another game?

787
00:46:50,072 --> 00:46:53,072
Okay, the timer's starting! Level 1!

788
00:46:53,072 --> 00:46:57,072
Dodge for 60 seconds to level up, okay?

789
00:46:57,072 --> 00:47:00,072
Okay, okay, I'm ready.

790
00:47:00,072 --> 00:47:03,072
There's a total of three levels,

791
00:47:03,072 --> 00:47:06,072
so try to escape to the very end!

792
00:47:07,572 --> 00:47:09,072
Ready, set... GO!

793
00:47:09,072 --> 00:47:11,072
GAME START!

794
00:47:10,572 --> 00:47:13,072
I'll do my best! Let's go!

795
00:47:14,072 --> 00:47:16,072
No, no, no!

796
00:47:20,072 --> 00:47:22,572
The onion! Not the onion!

797
00:47:29,072 --> 00:47:31,072
Not the spaghetti!

798
00:47:45,072 --> 00:47:47,572
Big cat, big trouble! Watch out!

799
00:47:48,072 --> 00:47:50,072
Big boss! Big boss!

800
00:47:51,072 --> 00:47:53,072
Ahhh!

801
00:47:58,072 --> 00:48:00,572
FAILED!

802
00:48:01,072 --> 00:48:03,072
Failure again! Oh no!

803
00:48:04,572 --> 00:48:07,072
You want to try again? One more time!

804
00:48:08,572 --> 00:48:11,072
Last time! Yay!

805
00:48:14,072 --> 00:48:16,572
Level 1 Revenge!

806
00:48:17,572 --> 00:48:20,072
How you feeling?

807
00:48:20,072 --> 00:48:23,072
Maybe we were a bit too hard on her.

808
00:48:23,072 --> 00:48:25,072
Yeah, that wasn't fair.

809
00:48:25,072 --> 00:48:29,072
We're gonna set the clock to 30 seconds.

810
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,572
Okay, let's do it then!

811
00:48:31,572 --> 00:48:34,072
I can definitely make it!

812
00:48:34,072 --> 00:48:36,072
Okay, we're gonna go again.

813
00:48:36,072 --> 00:48:38,072
Three, two, one...

814
00:48:38,072 --> 00:48:39,572
GAME START!

815
00:48:39,572 --> 00:48:41,572
GAME START!

816
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,572
CLEAR!

817
00:49:12,572 --> 00:49:15,572
Level one clear! Yay! You did it!

818
00:49:16,572 --> 00:49:19,572
That was too good, but... you can go on?

819
00:49:19,572 --> 00:49:22,572
That was just level one. Level two now!

820
00:49:25,072 --> 00:49:27,572
Level two? Too easy, you know?

821
00:49:27,572 --> 00:49:29,072
Oh, okay, wow!

822
00:49:29,072 --> 00:49:32,072
Let's try level two then! Okay, let's go!

823
00:49:32,072 --> 00:49:35,072
Yeah, you can do it!

824
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:38,072
I did it for the first time! Yeah!

825
00:49:40,072 --> 00:49:43,072
Ready... Level two! Start!

826
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,480
CLEAR!

827
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,480
Yatta! Level 2!
I did it! Level 2!

828
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,880
I did it for...

829
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,480
...for you guys!

830
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,480
You're not getting tired, are you?

831
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,580
Not slowing down or anything, huh?

832
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,280
Well, you know, maybe you didn't put enough effort.

833
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,980
Oh yeah? OK.

834
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,380
Well, we're gonna make it harder then!

835
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,280
Let's get ready for...

836
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,380
Level 3! Level 3!

837
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,880
No no no no no!

838
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,980
This is the last one.

839
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,880
This DICA is mine!

840
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,480
Can we go to the...

841
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,080
...next level?

842
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,480
But I think this one's gonna be extra hard!

843
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,480
Because you said that we weren't trying hard enough...

844
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,480
...you know what we're gonna do?

845
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:13,480
We're gonna make this one...

846
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,980
...you only have one try!

847
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,480
And you know what? That's not all.

848
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,480
It's gonna be extra hard!

849
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,480
You guys are cheating! This is not fair!

850
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,480
It's a game! You're so evil!

851
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,480
Alright, I better prepare myself.

852
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,980
Level 3! Let's go!

853
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,480
GAME START!

854
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,480
FAILED!

855
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,480
Just like we said! Waaaah!

856
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,980
Yeah, she went really...

857
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,480
I don't think she's gonna be able to come back from that.

858
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,480
No! It's over! Bau Bau!

859
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:25,180
GAME OVER

860
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,980
It's okay...

861
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:39,980
Yoshi yoshi yoshi yoshi...
There, there, there, there...

862
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:47,480
Well, you know guys...

863
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,980
...today is my 3D debut, right?

864
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,480
So maybe, you know, senpais...

865
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,480
...you guys could give me the ticket anyway?

866
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,980
No! No! No! No!

867
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,980
You have to suffer!

868
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,480
I'm not getting the ticket...

869
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,980
...no ticket for me... I'm so sad.

870
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,480
We have prepared a special stage for you!

871
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:14,980
Really!?

872
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,980
Yeah! You know, while it was fun, you know...

873
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,480
...torturing you with things you hate...

874
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,980
...that was really cute.

875
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,480
You know, we kind of want to see your cool side now.

876
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,980
My cool side? Really?

877
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,980
You want to see my cool side?

878
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,980
Yeah! Show it off to them!

879
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,480
Maybe you can put all those angry feelings into the next song!

880
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,980
Yeah! Sing! Yeah!

881
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,480
Okay! Let's go!

882
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,480
Let's go go go go!

883
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:56,980
恋は戦争 / Love is War
Love is War

884
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:07,480
もう行き場がないわ
There's nowhere left for me to go

885
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:12,980
この恋の熱量
In the heat of this love

886
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:23,980
ah...

887
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:50,180
灰色の雲
Gray clouds

888
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:57,480
モノクロの喧騒
Monochrome noise

889
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,480
日差しはかげり
The sunlight fades

890
00:55:00,254 --> 00:55:01,921
日差しはかげり
The sunlight fades

891
00:55:02,054 --> 00:55:07,788
夕暮れは色を変えていく
The twilight changes color

892
00:55:08,621 --> 00:55:10,154
嗚呼
Ah

893
00:55:10,221 --> 00:55:13,421
世界がにじんで
The world blurs

894
00:55:13,954 --> 00:55:18,921
それでも好きでいられるかなんて
I wonder if I can still love you

895
00:55:19,554 --> 00:55:21,521
わかってる
I know

896
00:55:21,588 --> 00:55:24,421
けどどうすればいいの
but what should I do?

897
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:29,388
どうしたら どうすれば
What can I do? What should I do?

898
00:55:30,221 --> 00:55:32,421
バカだな わたし...
I'm such a fool...

899
00:55:33,354 --> 00:55:35,421
始めるのよ
I'm starting it

900
00:55:35,488 --> 00:55:38,354
これは戦争
this is a war

901
00:55:39,021 --> 00:55:43,854
嬉しそうなキミをみるなんて
To see you looking so happy

902
00:55:44,821 --> 00:55:47,421
切なる恋
This aching love

903
00:55:47,888 --> 00:55:49,721
それは罪
it's a sin

904
00:55:50,454 --> 00:55:52,521
見せてあげる
I'll show you

905
00:55:52,588 --> 00:55:55,421
わたしの想いを
my feelings

906
00:56:06,754 --> 00:56:09,188
叫んでみた
I tried shouting

907
00:56:09,254 --> 00:56:15,621
メガホンは壊れてたの
but the megaphone was broken

908
00:56:17,421 --> 00:56:21,088
どれだけ背伸びしたって
No matter how much I stand on tiptoes

909
00:56:21,888 --> 00:56:26,788
君の視界に入らない
I don't enter your field of vision

910
00:56:28,254 --> 00:56:29,754
嗚呼
Ah

911
00:56:29,821 --> 00:56:34,954
いつの間にか晴れた空
before I knew it, the sky cleared

912
00:56:35,954 --> 00:56:38,288
全然似合わない
It doesn't suit me at all

913
00:56:39,121 --> 00:56:43,454
気持ちが抑えられなくて
I can't suppress my feelings

914
00:56:44,288 --> 00:56:48,488
どうしたら どうすれば
What can I do? What should I do?

915
00:56:49,221 --> 00:56:54,488
泣いてなんか ないんだからね
It's not like I'm crying or anything

916
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,721
大好き
I love you

917
00:56:58,354 --> 00:57:00,688
たたかうのよ
I'm going to fight

918
00:57:00,754 --> 00:57:04,321
ハートを撃て
shoot through the heart

919
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:08,854
手段なんて選んでられない
I can't afford to choose my means

920
00:57:10,021 --> 00:57:11,888
スカートひらり
With a flutter of my skirt

921
00:57:12,521 --> 00:57:14,488
見せつけるのよ
I'll show you

922
00:57:15,388 --> 00:57:21,121
君の視線奪ってみせるの
I'll show you I can steal your gaze

923
00:57:22,488 --> 00:57:25,188
迎撃用意
Prepare for interception

924
00:57:25,254 --> 00:57:30,888
戦況は未だ不利なのです
the war situation is still unfavorable

925
00:57:31,988 --> 00:57:36,654
恋は盲目
Love is blind

926
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:42,221
君の口づけで目が覚めるの
I wake up with your kiss

927
00:57:49,121 --> 00:57:53,421
Nights at Chattini Land

928
00:57:59,121 --> 00:58:00,254
Ah!

929
00:58:00,321 --> 00:58:02,921
I'm sorry Chattini!

930
00:58:03,554 --> 00:58:08,621
I tried my best, but I only got two!

931
00:58:08,721 --> 00:58:09,221
Oh...

932
00:58:09,588 --> 00:58:12,688
Noooo... my jetpack...

933
00:58:14,754 --> 00:58:15,621
Oh!

934
00:58:15,688 --> 00:58:16,921
Oh!

935
00:58:18,488 --> 00:58:20,754
The jetpack exploded!

936
00:58:21,888 --> 00:58:23,788
I'm sorry Chattini.

937
00:58:25,188 --> 00:58:28,554
Actually, I have a present for all of you!

938
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:32,488
Present? I wonder what it is? Is it a cucumber?

939
00:58:33,488 --> 00:58:34,988
Ah, mm-mm.

940
00:58:35,421 --> 00:58:37,154
Let me tell you.

941
00:58:37,221 --> 00:58:39,721
Eira, eira, eira.
Good, good, good.

942
00:58:40,488 --> 00:58:45,121
That's the best! It's not a jetpack but it's really nice!

943
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:47,521
Thanks Chattini!

944
00:58:47,588 --> 00:58:54,721
Well then, before I reveal the best present ever, I've got an announcement to make!

945
00:58:55,354 --> 00:58:56,921
Ta-da!

946
00:58:57,521 --> 00:59:01,488
Raora Panthera Pencil Case & Keychain!

947
00:59:02,254 --> 00:59:07,854
Yes, this is a cute pencil case with me in a Chattini costume!

948
00:59:08,288 --> 00:59:12,921
So I hope you guys can bring it everywhere, at school, in the office...

949
00:59:13,354 --> 00:59:16,188
Literally everywhere!

950
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:19,521
So please don't miss it out, okay?

951
00:59:20,254 --> 00:59:26,788
Ah, that was such a fun 3D showcase with a lot of things happening!

952
00:59:27,221 --> 00:59:29,021
Did everyone have fun?

953
00:59:29,221 --> 00:59:31,488
Chattini, did you guys have fun?

954
00:59:32,488 --> 00:59:34,421
Oh, thank you!

955
00:59:34,721 --> 00:59:36,654
I'm so happy to hear that!

956
00:59:37,488 --> 00:59:38,854
Thank you!

957
00:59:39,288 --> 00:59:43,854
Since like you guys had a great time with me today I'm so happy!

958
00:59:44,288 --> 00:59:45,454
Thank you!

959
00:59:45,521 --> 00:59:51,421
I'll keep doing my best to bring fun streams and more 3D live performances like this one today, okay?

960
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:54,121
I appreciate you guys so much!

961
00:59:54,188 --> 00:59:56,921
Thank you Chattini for all your support!

962
00:59:57,254 --> 00:59:59,088
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

963
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:01,396
Finally!

964
01:00:02,196 --> 01:00:07,496
It's the long awaited present from me to everyone!

965
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:09,196
Are you guys ready?

966
01:00:09,396 --> 01:00:11,296
The present is...

967
01:00:12,596 --> 01:00:17,596
my first original song!

968
01:00:20,596 --> 01:00:22,596
Ah, I'm so happy!

969
01:00:23,096 --> 01:00:28,096
It's full of things I like and so many personal touches.

970
01:00:28,596 --> 01:00:34,596
I worked really, really hard on this song so I hope you guys gonna take a listen to it, okay?

971
01:00:35,096 --> 01:00:37,596
Are you guys ready? Are you guys excited?

972
01:00:37,896 --> 01:00:40,596
Let's go to the stage!

973
01:00:50,096 --> 01:00:53,096
Gacha x Gacha ADVENTURE!

976
01:01:04,596 --> 01:01:06,596
さあ、さあ、お宝探しだ
Come on, come on, it's treasure hunting time!

977
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:09,896
今日は、ど〜んな獲物が見つかるかにゃ？
What kind of prey will we find today?

978
01:01:10,596 --> 01:01:12,896
ほら、ほら、みんなも一緒に
Look, look, everyone together

979
01:01:13,096 --> 01:01:15,096
「楽しい冒険、しゅっば〜つ！」 (Un! Due! Tre!)
"Fun adventure, let's go!" (One! Two! Three!)

980
01:01:15,896 --> 01:01:18,896
ハマっちゃったら抜け出せないの〜
Once you're hooked, you can't get out~

981
01:01:19,596 --> 01:01:21,096
食べ物 ぬいぐるみ
Food, stuffed animals

982
01:01:21,596 --> 01:01:23,096
Pizza も Pasta も 全部
Pizza and Pasta, everything

983
01:01:23,196 --> 01:01:24,096
詰め込んだ魅惑の迷宮
A packed maze of fascination

984
01:01:24,196 --> 01:01:26,596
ワクワク止まらない (Proviamo!)
The excitement won't stop (Let's try!)

985
01:01:27,096 --> 01:01:29,596
取れそうで取れなくてイライラ
It's frustrating when you're so close but can't get it

986
01:01:30,096 --> 01:01:31,596
クレーンゲーム
Crane game

987
01:01:32,096 --> 01:01:33,096
「にゃ〜もう！」
"Meow~ geez!"

988
01:01:33,096 --> 01:01:35,096
諦めたままリタイア
Giving up and retiring

989
01:01:35,596 --> 01:01:39,096
するはずないじゃない！
There's no way I'd do that!

990
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:41,096
「目指せコンプリート！」
"Aim for complete collection!"

991
01:01:41,096 --> 01:01:43,596
さあ、もう一回 止めても無駄だよ
Come on, one more time, it's no use stopping me

992
01:01:44,096 --> 01:01:46,596
もう一回 繰り返すデジャヴ
One more time, a repeating déjà vu

993
01:01:47,096 --> 01:01:48,596
諦めろって言わないで
Don't tell me to give up

994
01:01:49,096 --> 01:01:51,596
三度目の正直
Third time's the charm

995
01:01:52,096 --> 01:01:54,096
だから無問題 溢れる想いが
So no problem, these overflowing feelings
