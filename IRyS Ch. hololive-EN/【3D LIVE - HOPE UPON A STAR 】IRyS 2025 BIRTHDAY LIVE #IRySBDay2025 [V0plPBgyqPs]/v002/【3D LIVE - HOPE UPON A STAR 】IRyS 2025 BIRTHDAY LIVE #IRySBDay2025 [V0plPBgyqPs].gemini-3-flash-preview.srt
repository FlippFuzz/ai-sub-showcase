あっ...
Ah...

3
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,500
What can I do for you?

4
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,900
What can I do for you?

5
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,900
What can I do for you?

6
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
What can I do for you?

7
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,100
I can hear you

8
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,400
What can I do for you?

9
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,300

10

12
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,400
あの日ココロの彼方に
Beyond the heart of that day

13
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,300
描いてた場所にいる
I am in the place I pictured

14
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,400
途方に暮れてたりする
Sometimes I'm at a loss

15
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,300
けれどももう戻れない
But I can't go back anymore

16
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,100
夢に見たカタチとは
From the shape I saw in my dreams

17
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,400
なにもかもが違う
Everything is different

18
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,800
現実には
In reality

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,200
眩暈さえする
It even makes me dizzy

20
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,100
リアルな世界に揺れてる感情
Emotions swaying in the real world

21
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,400
負けたくない
I don't want to lose

22
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,400
もうただ走るしかないこの胸に
In this chest that has no choice but to run

23
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,800
聴こえてくる
I can hear it

24
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
越えてキミは一人じゃない
Surpassing it, you are not alone

25
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,100
What can I do for you?

26
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,100
What can I do for you?

27
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,000
What can I do for you?

28
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,308
I CAN HEAR YOU

29
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:03,408
What can I do for you?

30
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:04,608
What can I do for you?

31
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:05,908
What can I do for you?

32
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:07,108
What can I do for you?

33
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,308
決して振り向きはしない
I'll never look back

34
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:16,208
あなたには頼らない
I won't depend on you

35
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:20,108
なにかがあれば必ず
If anything happens, surely

36
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:24,008
すぐに来てくれるから
You'll come right away

37
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:27,708
いまぼくにできること
What I can do now

38
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,508
それは信じること...
Is to believe...

39
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:33,708
真実なら
If it's the truth

40
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,308
この胸にある
It's in my heart

41
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:43,008
リアルな世界に揺れてる感情
Emotions swaying in the real world

42
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:47,008
支えるのはそうあなたが
Supported by, yes, you

43
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:51,308
教えてくれたすべて
Everything you taught me

44
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:55,708
いまの私だから、
Because it's who I am now,

45
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,508
だから、一人じゃない
So, I'm not alone

46
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:07,308
What can I do for you?

47
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:09,108
What can I do for you?

48
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:10,808
What can I do for you?

49
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,408
What can I do for you?

50
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,008
What can I do for you?

51
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,708
What can I do for you?

52
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:18,408
What can I do for you?

53
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,108
What can I do for you?

54
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:22,308
What can I do

55
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,308
What can I do

56
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:26,308
What can I do for you?

57
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:30,808
I CAN HEAR YOU

58
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:36,408
リアルな世界に揺れてる感情
Emotions swaying in the real world

59
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:40,308
感じてもあなたが
Even if I feel them, you

60
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:44,708
目を閉じたらそこにいる
Are there when I close my eyes

61
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:48,008
絆がある
There's a bond

62
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:51,008
だから、一人じゃない
So, I'm not alone

63
00:06:51,508 --> 00:06:55,508
リアルな世界に揺れてる感情
Emotions swaying in the real world

64
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,808
負けたくない
I don't want to lose

65
00:06:59,308 --> 00:07:03,508
もうただ走るしかないこの胸に
In my heart that now just has to run

66
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,808
聞こえてくる
I can hear it

67
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:09,808
キミは一人じゃない
You are not alone

68
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:11,408
What can I do for you?

69
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:13,108
What can I do for you?

70
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:14,808
What can I do for you?

71
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,708
I CAN HEAR YOU

72
00:07:17,908 --> 00:07:19,208
What can I do for you?

73
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:20,908
What can I do for you?

74
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,608
What can I do for you?

75
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:25,308
I CAN HEAR YOU

76
00:07:27,108 --> 00:07:29,108
I CAN HEAR YOU

Lyrics, Music: Koji Mihara

78
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:12,108
踊ってるだけで退場
Leaving just for dancing

79
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,808
それをそっかそっかって言って
Saying "I see, I see" to that

80
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:17,508
お幸せについて問う
Questioning about happiness

81
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,208
何が正義なんかって思う
Thinking about what justice is

82
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:23,108
生意気そうにガム噛んで
Chewing gum insolently

83
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:25,808
それもいいないいなって思う
Thinking that's nice too

84
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,608
テレスコープ越しの感情
Emotions through a telescope

85
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,308
どこかに全部詰め込んだ
Crammed them all somewhere

86
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,008
踊ってない夜を知らない
I don't know a night without dancing

87
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,508
踊ってない夜が気に入らない
I don't like a night without dancing

88
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,108
踊ってない夜を知らない
I don't know a night without dancing

89
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:42,508
踊ってない夜が気に入らないよ
I don't like a night without dancing

90
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:46,408
気に入らない夜なんて僕は知らない
I don't know any nights I don't like

91
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,008
踊ってない夜がない夜なんて
A night without a night without dancing is

92
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:53,608
とってもとっても退屈です
Very, very boring

93
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:08,008
想ってるだけで行動
Just thinking and acting

94
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:10,508
きっとないと音楽も踊る
Even the music dances, surely

95
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:13,308
ダンスでダンスする現状
Dancing a dance, current state

96
00:09:13,508 --> 00:09:15,908
これはチャンスなんかって思う
Thinking maybe this is a chance

97
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,608
カセットがほらタンタン
Look, the cassette goes tan-tan

98
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,808
タタタンタンタタタンタン
Ta-ta-tan-tan, ta-ta-tan-tan

99
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,508
踊ってない夜を知らない人とか
Those who don't know a night without dancing

100
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,108
この世に一人もございません
There's not a single one in this world

101
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,908
踊ってない夜を知らない
I don't know a night without dancing

102
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:32,408
踊ってない夜が気に入らない
I don't like a night without dancing

103
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,008
踊ってない夜を知らない
I don't know a night without dancing

104
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,408
踊ってない夜が気に入らないよ
I don't like a night without dancing

105
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:42,308
気に入らない夜なんて僕は知らない
I don't know any nights I don't like

106
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:44,908
踊ってない夜がない夜なんて
A night without a night without dancing is

107
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:49,508
とってもとっても退屈です
Very, very boring

108
00:09:49,908 --> 00:09:52,308
いつも待ってる
Always waiting

109
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,808
ダンスホールは待ってる
The dance hall is waiting

110
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:57,408
変わってく変わってく
Changing, changing

111
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:59,008
傷だらけでも待つ
Waiting even if covered in wounds

112
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:03,152
ほら 踊ってる
See, I'm dancing

113
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:05,821
ダンスホールの未来に
In the dance hall's future

114
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:11,794
色を塗っていくのは あなた あなた
The one painting the colors is you, you

115
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:14,497
ダンスは笑顔で待ってる
The dance is waiting with a smile

116
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,555
踊ってない夜を知らない
I don't know a night without dancing

117
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,558
踊ってない夜が気に入らない
I don't like a night without dancing

118
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,361
踊ってない夜を知らない
I don't know a night without dancing

119
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:48,864
踊ってない夜が気に入らないよ
I don't like a night without dancing

120
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:51,567
気に入らない夜なんてもう僕は知らない
I don't know any more nights I don't like

121
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,070
踊ってない夜がない夜なんて
A night without a night without dancing

122
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,278
踊ってたい夜を知りたい
I want to know a night where I want to dance

123
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:05,281
踊ってたい夜を気に入りた〜い
I want to like a night where I want to dance

124
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:07,883
踊ってない夜を知らない
I don't know a night without dancing

125
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:10,586
踊ってない夜が気に入らないよ
I don't like a night without dancing

126
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,589
気に入らない夜なんてもう僕は知らない
I don't know any more nights I don't like

127
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,292
踊ってない夜がない夜なんて
A night without a night without dancing

128
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:21,530
とってもとってもとっても大切なんです
It's very, very, very important

129

Why is it not turning off?

384
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:45,388
You guys didn't hear anything, right?

385
00:33:45,388 --> 00:33:47,388
何も聞いてないよね？
You guys didn't hear anything, right?

386
00:33:47,388 --> 00:33:50,188
You guys were deaf for a second, I'm sure, right?

387
00:33:50,188 --> 00:33:52,588
何も聞いてない。大丈夫。
You didn't hear anything. It's fine.

388
00:33:53,088 --> 00:33:58,588
Anyways, do you guys know what this is?

389
00:33:58,588 --> 00:34:01,088
It's my boombox!

390
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,588
ラジカセでございます。
It is a radio cassette player.

391
00:34:03,588 --> 00:34:07,288
I'll be using this later, so let me put it back down.

392
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:10,088
But I just wanted to do that. It's my boombox.

393
00:34:10,088 --> 00:34:12,688
It changes the world, but I don't have boiled goose.

394
00:34:12,688 --> 00:34:16,588
Anyways, it's cool and retro, and actually...

395
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:19,488
I have a couple of announcements for the show.

396
00:34:19,488 --> 00:34:22,588
But first, I want to talk about one obvious announcement.

397
00:34:22,588 --> 00:34:24,388
The merch!

398
00:34:24,388 --> 00:34:27,288

400
00:34:29,388 --> 00:34:32,588
その前にね、IRySの記念グッズ、紹介しようと思います。
but before that, I'd like to introduce IRyS's commemorative goods.

401
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:37,888
Isn't it cute? I wanted to create a set that matches the retro feel of today's live.

402
00:34:37,888 --> 00:34:41,088
So let's take a look at what kind of goods are available.

403
00:34:41,088 --> 00:34:44,588
ではどんなグッズがあるのか、見ていきましょう！
Then let's see what kind of goods there are!

404
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:48,488
First off, we have the Concert PosteRyS!

405
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:50,088
Isn't it sexy?

406
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:54,088
I wanted to make it look like a poster for an in-real-life concert.

407
00:34:54,088 --> 00:34:57,688
This time, actually, continuing from last time as well...

408
00:34:57,688 --> 00:35:00,088
the illustration is by Pisuke-sensei!

409
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:01,403
Say, I love P-suke-sensei's art.

410
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:03,203
She has an amazing fashion sense.

411
00:35:03,203 --> 00:35:05,403
The outfits are always so peak.

412
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,803
Just look at this sexy disco-style outfit.

413
00:35:07,803 --> 00:35:10,603
Yes, it's sexy, right? Yes, it's sexy.

414
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:15,903
えーとね、まずは最初はこちら、コンサートポスタリスでございます。
First off, here is the Concert PosteRyS.

415
00:35:15,903 --> 00:35:20,203

Have you seen this kind of thing as real live merch? It's a big poster.

416
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:26,803
それをね、アイリスも作ってみたくて、今回P-suke先生に素敵な絵を描いてもらって、作っていただきました。
I wanted to make one too, so I had P-suke-sensei draw a wonderful illustration for it.

417
00:35:26,803 --> 00:35:29,703
みんなどうかな？かわいいよね。
What do you all think? It's cute, right?

418
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,503
And next...

419
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:36,603
We have the Concert T-ShirtRyS.

420
00:35:36,603 --> 00:35:41,203
It's my first time releasing a T-shirt, if we don't count the Omacat ones.

421
00:35:41,203 --> 00:35:45,103
You need to have a T-shirt for a live concert, of course, right?

422
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:47,903
I know we're not at an in-person venue,

423
00:35:47,903 --> 00:35:53,403
but I hope you buy a shirt as a memento of this 3D live and you can wear it for future stuff, future events, yeah!

424
00:35:53,703 --> 00:35:58,203
今回の3Dライブの思い出に買ってもらえると嬉しいです。
I hope you'll buy it as a memory of this 3D live.

425
00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:00,903
And we still have more!

426
00:36:02,403 --> 00:36:05,903
The third item is the BackpackRyS.

427
00:36:05,903 --> 00:36:10,503
I love the little details in the design, like the zipper charm and the lining.

428
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:16,903
Yeah, it's like a bigger version of the shoulder bagRyS, which I think a lot of you guys liked.

429
00:36:16,903 --> 00:36:23,103
I put a lot of thought into all of this, and it's perfect for carrying all of your IRyS merch!

430
00:36:23,803 --> 00:36:29,103
ぜひね、イベントやライブなどで使ってね。もうめっちゃかっこいいんで。ぜひぜひぜひ。
Please use it at events and concerts. It's really cool, so definitely check it out.

431
00:36:29,803 --> 00:36:31,103
And finally...

432
00:36:32,503 --> 00:36:35,503
We have the YabaiRyS Keychain!

433
00:36:35,503 --> 00:36:40,503
I know you guys, and me personally, have all been wanting a doll that has this face.

434
00:36:40,503 --> 00:36:45,103
Look at it. She's so cute. I wonder what she's thinking about.

435
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:49,903
Surely, 'seiso' thoughts. When you press her, she makes a sound.

436
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:55,003
Surely, a 'seiso' sound. Um, you can put her on your BackpackRyS and take her everywhere with you.

437
00:36:56,603 --> 00:37:00,703
ヤバいことが起きても、ヤバリスが何とかしてくれることないかも...
Even if something bad happens, YabaiRyS might not be able to help...

438
00:37:00,703 --> 00:37:03,303
まあ、この顔なんでね。うん。
Well, look at that face. Yeah.

439
00:37:05,203 --> 00:37:10,603

The limited edition set comes with my handwritten signature, and the regular full set comes with a foil-stamped replica signature.

443
00:37:30,203 --> 00:37:35,903
お間違い無いように。アイリスの汚い字みたいよね。なので、お急ぎ。
Don't mix them up. You want to see my messy handwriting, right? So hurry up.

444
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:37,503
And that's not all!

for purchase, the YaBA KAWAII edition

786
01:03:05,174 --> 01:03:06,724
and the YaBA CHIC edition.

787
01:03:06,724 --> 01:03:09,674
The YaBA KAWAII jacket illustration is drawn
by maesjuw-san,

788
01:03:09,724 --> 01:03:13,674
and the YaBA CHIC jacket illustration is drawn
by SYAGAMU-san.

789
01:03:13,724 --> 01:03:18,174
The jackets are reversible, so you will be able to
switch between the two no matter which version you buy.

790
01:03:18,224 --> 01:03:22,174
Both jackets are absolutely adorable!

791
01:03:22,224 --> 01:03:26,674
The main difference between the two versions
are the sticker set designs that will be included.

792
01:03:26,724 --> 01:03:30,174
Both sets are drawn by LIEN-sensei.

793
01:03:30,224 --> 01:03:33,674
There are two different types of stickers
included with each EP version.

794
01:03:33,724 --> 01:03:38,674
One of which is a larger size and waterproof, so
it would be great if you could put it on your car.

795
01:03:38,724 --> 01:03:43,174
The other is a smartphone size, so you can take
it with you wherever you go.

796
01:03:43,224 --> 01:03:48,174
Also, the alternate jacket may have a
handwritten signature on it, so please look forward to it!

797
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:52,174
This EP is packed with Euro sounds,

798
01:03:52,224 --> 01:03:55,174
I'm really looking forward to sharing them all
with you and I hope you buy a copy.

799
01:03:55,224 --> 01:03:59,674
