2
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,150
So everything that makes me whole

3
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,000
今君に捧げよう
I will offer it all to you now

4
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,700
I'm yours

5
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My Dearest
Lyrics, Music: ryo (supercell)

6
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,000
ねえ
Hey

7
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,000
こんなに笑えたこと
Having been able to laugh this much

8
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,900
生まれて初めてだよ
Is a first since I was born

9
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,800
きっと
Surely

10
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,500
私はね
I, you see,

11
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,000
この日の
For this day

12
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,600
ために間違いだらけの
To walk down a path

13
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,600
道を歩いてきたんだ
That was full of mistakes

14
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,200
ずっと
Always

15
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,500
一人で
All alone

16
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,800
遠く遠くどこまでも遠く
Far, far away, as far as it goes

17
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
君と二人手を取って
Hand in hand with you

18
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,200
永遠にどこまでだって行けるはず
We should be able to go anywhere for eternity

19
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,000
もう一人じゃないと
Thinking I'm no longer alone

20
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:03,208
みわたせば
If I look around...

21
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:10,508
また笑って
...and you smile again...

22
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:17,508
守るべき大事なものが今あって
There is something important I must protect now

23
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:23,208
だけどなすすべもなく立ち尽くす時は
But when I stand still with no way to act

24
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:29,008
可能性を失って暗闇が君を
When you lose all possibility and darkness

25
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:34,508
覆い隠し絶望に飲み込まれるそんな時は
Covers you and you're swallowed by despair

26
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:40,508
私が君を照らす明かりになるから
I will be the light that illuminates you

27
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:46,208
たとえこの世界の王にだって消せはしない
Even for the king of this world, it won't be extinguished

28
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:50,008
So, everything that makes me whole

29
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:56,508
今君に捧げよう
I'll dedicate it to you now

30
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:03,508
I'm Yours

31
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:10,808
ねぇ この世界にはたくさんの
Hey, in this world there is so much

32
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:16,508
幸せがあるんだね
happiness, isn't there?

33
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:25,508
いつか二人なら
If it's the two of us someday...

34
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:31,508
誰かが君のことを嘘つきと呼んで
Someone calls you a liar

35
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:37,508
心ない言葉で傷つけようとしても
And tries to hurt you with heartless words

36
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:43,208
世界が君のことを信じようともせずに
Even if the world refuses to believe in you

37
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:48,808
茨の冠を被せようとしても
And tries to put a crown of thorns on you

38
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:54,808
私は君だけの味方になれるよ
I can be your only ally

39
00:06:55,008 --> 00:07:00,808
その孤独痛みを私は知っている
I know that loneliness and pain

40
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:04,208
So, everything that makes me whole

41
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:11,208
今君に捧げよう
I'll dedicate it to you now

42
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,508
I'm Yours

43
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:51,208
いつか私を知ることができたなら
If you are able to know me someday

44
00:07:51,508 --> 00:07:57,508
必ずその場所に私はいるから
I'll definitely be in that place

45
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:03,208
そこに希望の欠片すらなかったとしても
Even if there wasn't even a fragment of hope there

46
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:08,808
私があってはならないものであっても
Even if I'm something that shouldn't exist

47
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:14,508
君は忘れないでいてくれることを
Please don't forget that you will...

48
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:20,508
誰よりも私がそのことを知ってる
I know that better than anyone

49
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:32,008
だから私君のために全てを今
So for your sake, I'll now... all...

50
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:37,508
捧げよう
dedicate to you

51
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,008
鉄の弾が正義の証明
An iron ball is proof of justice

52
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:07,008
貫けば英雄に近づいた
If it pierces through, you've come closer to being a hero

53
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:10,208
その目を閉じて触れてみれば
If you close your eyes and try to touch it

54
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:14,808
同じ形 同じ体温の悪魔
It's a devil of the same shape and temperature

55
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:17,808
僕はダメで あいつはいいの？
I'm no good but they're okay?

56
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,508
そこに壁があっただけなのに
Even though there was just a wall there

57
00:09:20,808 --> 00:09:23,208
生まれてしまった運命嘆くな
Don't lament the fate you were born into

58
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:26,508
僕らはみんな自由なんだから
Because we're all free

59
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:30,008
悪魔の子
Lyrics, Music: ヒグチアイ
The Devil's Child
Lyrics, Music: Ai Higuchi

60
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:30,508
鳥のように羽があれば
If I had wings like a bird

61
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:36,508
どこへだって行けるけど
I could go anywhere

62
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:42,008
帰る場所がなければきっと
But if I have no place to return to

63
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:47,008
どこへも行けない
I'm sure I won't be able to go anywhere

64
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:52,508
ただただ生きるのは嫌だ
I just don't want to simply exist

65
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:58,208
世界は残酷だ
The world is cruel

66
00:09:58,508 --> 00:10:00,008
それでも君を
Even so, I...

67
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:02,816
君を愛すよ
I love you

68
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:08,016
何を犠牲にしても
No matter what I sacrifice

69
00:10:08,516 --> 00:10:13,216
それでも君を守るよ
I will still protect you

70
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:16,816
間違いだとしても
Even if it's a mistake

71
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,516
疑ったりしない
I won't doubt it

72
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:22,516
正しさとは自分のこと
Righteousness is about yourself

73
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:25,816
強く信じることだ
believing strongly.

74
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:36,016
鉄の雨が降り頻る情景
A scene where iron rain falls incessantly.

75
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:38,816
テレビの中、映画に見えたんだ
It looked like a movie on TV.

76
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:41,516
戦争なんて愚かな凶暴
War is just foolish violence.

77
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:44,216
関係ない、知らない国の話
It's irrelevant, a story from an unknown country.

78
00:10:44,516 --> 00:10:47,316
それなら何で、あいつを憎んで
Then why do I hate that person

79
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:49,816
黒い気持ち隠しきれない
and can't hide these dark feelings?

80
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,316
訳、説明だってできやしないんだ
I can't even explain the reason.

81
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:55,816
僕らはなんて矛盾ばかりなんだ
How full of contradictions we are.

82
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:21,016
この言葉も訳されれば
If these words were translated,

83
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:26,516
本当の意味は伝わらない
the true meaning wouldn't be conveyed.

84
00:11:28,516 --> 00:11:31,216
信じるのは、その目を開いて
What I believe in is, opening those eyes

85
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:37,316
触れた世界だけ
only the world you've touched.

86
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:45,316
ただただ生きるのは嫌だ
I just hate living pointlessly.

87
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:49,016
世界は残酷だ
The world is cruel.

88
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:52,016
それでも君を愛すよ
But I still love you.

89
00:11:52,516 --> 00:11:56,816
何を犠牲にしても
No matter what I sacrifice

90
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:02,316
それでも君を愛すよ
But I still love you.

91
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:07,516
それでも君を守るよ
I will still protect you.

92
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:12,316
選んだ人の影、捨てた者の屍
The shadows of the chosen, the corpses of the discarded.

93
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:14,516
気づいたんだ自分の中
I realized that inside me

94
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:18,016
育つのは悪魔の子
is the child of a devil growing.

95
00:12:18,216 --> 00:12:20,516
正義の裏、犠牲の中
Behind justice, amidst sacrifice

96
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:25,816
心には悪魔の子
there's a devil's child in the heart.

97
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:58,316
Hi-RyS! It's IRyS from hololive English -Promise-.

98
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:00,816
hololive Englishのアイリスです！
I'm IRyS from hololive English!

99
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:07,316
Welcome to my 3rd anniversary live, "Devil Wears Hope"! Whoo!

100
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:13,216
I know it's a little late due to scheduling issues, but I'm so glad I'm finally able to do this! Yay!

101
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:21,516
えっと、ウェルカム、アイリスの、えっと、Devil Wears Hope、えっと、3周年のライブへようこそ！
Um, welcome to IRyS's... um, Devil Wears Hope... um, 3rd anniversary live! Welcome!

102
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:26,516
Thank you very much for coming. 来てくださりありがとうございます！
Thank you very much for coming. Thank you for coming!

103
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:31,516
Ha ha! How'd you guys like the first two songs?

104
00:13:31,816 --> 00:13:35,516
Yes, my dear Nakaman-ko! Did you guys notice that they were held on different stages? Yeah?

105
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:39,016
「悪魔の子」と "My Dearest"、どうでしたか？
How did you like "Akuma no Ko" and "My Dearest"?

106
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:44,216
両方とも、あのなんと、別のステージで歌ってたんじゃないかなって、今頃みんな気づいてるんじゃないかな？
Both were... um, actually sung on different stages. I think everyone is noticing that by now.

107
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:49,016
Yeah, this—where I am right now—is the devil stage. It's very pretty and purple.

108
00:13:49,216 --> 00:13:55,816
And over there is where the beautiful angelic stage is. Yes!

109
00:13:56,016 --> 00:14:00,516
I will be moving around quite a lot this live to sing many songs.

110
00:14:00,816 --> 00:14:03,316
And even though there's two stages, there might be even more!

111
00:14:03,516 --> 00:14:09,516
なんとね、このあのダブルステージでお披露目させていただきます。というかダブルステージどころか、もっとあるかもしれません。
Actually, I'll be performing on this double stage. Or rather, instead of just a double stage, there might be even more.

112
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:13,016
歌うところね。楽しみにしてて下さい。
Places to sing, I mean. Please look forward to it.

113
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:16,816
えっと、As you guys can tell by now...
Um, as you guys can tell by now...

114
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:26,016
the theme of this live this time is Angel and Devil theme, because there's no other theme that would fit me as perfectly as this.

115
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:31,816
えっと、今回のライブのテーマはなんと、天使と悪魔です！多分今頃もうみんな気づいてると思うんですけど。
Um, the theme of this live is... wow, Angel and Devil! I think everyone's already noticed by now, though.

116
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:39,516
アイリスはね、えっと、半分悪魔、半分天使なんでね。そちらをね、あの、もう、パーフェクトなライブになるかと思います！
IRyS is, um, half-devil and half-angel. With that, I think it's going to be a perfect live!

117
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:45,316
I will be singing a lot of songs with a lot of guests, and there might be a very special announcement!

118
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:49,016
So I hope you guys look forward to that, yeah? Make sure you watch till the end.

119
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:55,816
And make sure you use the hashtag #DevilWearsHope to tweet your thoughts. Thank you!

Please, I'm waiting for your tweets and thoughts with this #DevilWearsHope hashtag! Thank you very much!

121
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,374
...続けてお願いします。

122
00:15:01,474 --> 00:15:02,424
えっとね、
Um...

123
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:05,444
この後たくさんの曲をたくさんのステージでね、
After this, I'll sing many songs on many stages,

124
00:15:05,524 --> 00:15:10,244
たくさんのゲストと最後まで歌いますんで、みんな最後まで見てね。
with many guests until the end, so please watch until the end.

125
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:13,274
あとね、それどころからもうね、
And also, even more than that,

126
00:15:13,374 --> 00:15:15,174
あのとっても素敵なね、
there's a very wonderful...

127
00:15:15,274 --> 00:15:17,374
あの告知も最後の方にあるんで、
announcement towards the end,

128
00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:18,574
最後まで見てください！
so please watch until the end!

129
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:21,874
では、Please... Oh, I have to go to the next stage again to sing more songs.
Well, please... Oh, I have to go to the next stage again to sing more songs.

130
00:15:22,474 --> 00:15:24,574
では、Be right back! Yeah!
So, I'll be right back! Yeah!

131
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:27,574
Off to the next stage!

132
00:15:36,524 --> 00:15:43,524
Estia casa misti fidi adora

133
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:49,024
to the beginning / Lyrics, Music: 梶浦由記
to the beginning / Lyrics, Music: Yuki Kajiura

134
00:15:57,074 --> 00:16:02,374
あと一度だけ 奇跡は起こるだろう
Just one more time, a miracle will happen, I'm sure

135
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:08,874
優しい声で描く 歪んだ未来
The distorted future drawn by a gentle voice

136
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:15,574
もう誰も泣かない世界のために
For the sake of a world where no one cries anymore

137
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:21,074
紅く汚された空のどこにも
Nowhere in the crimson-stained sky

138
00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:28,074
届かず消える 叫びと祈り
Cries and prayers that vanish without reaching

139
00:16:28,574 --> 00:16:32,074
慰めさえすべてを裏切る
Even comfort betrays everything

140
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:38,274
きれいな月光の光が 始まりへと沈み行く
The beautiful moonlight sinks towards the beginning

141
00:16:38,574 --> 00:16:44,574
その彼方へ 閉ざされて行く瞳で
Towards that far-off place, with eyes that are closing

142
00:16:45,074 --> 00:16:50,074
まだ遠くへ手を伸ばす
Still reaching out into the distance

143
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:54,074
君の嘆きを
Towards your grief

144
00:16:54,574 --> 00:17:03,074
信じて
Believe in it

145
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:22,074
本当は誰か 救いたくて
Wishing in truth to save someone

146
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:28,574
迷う心が空に穴を穿つ
This wandering heart bores a hole into the sky

147
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:35,074
君を選んで二人で行く
Choosing you, the two of us go on

148
00:17:35,574 --> 00:17:41,074
喜びを探しながら
While searching for joy

149
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:47,574
どんな冷たい焔に身を焼かれても
No matter how cold the flames that burn us

150
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:54,074
微笑みの近く
Close to a smile

151
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:59,574
のたうつ夢
A writhing dream

152
00:18:00,074 --> 00:18:06,074
命の意味を
The meaning of life

153
00:18:06,574 --> 00:18:13,274
振り翳して この世界を
Brandishing it, this world

154
00:18:13,574 --> 00:18:18,074
真夏の闇の中へ 返したい
I want to return it to the darkness of midsummer

155
00:18:18,574 --> 00:18:22,074
哀しみだけ消せはしない
Grief alone cannot be erased

156
00:18:22,574 --> 00:18:28,574
そんな人の心の
Of such a human heart

157
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:34,074
理さえこの手で切り裂いて
Even the laws, with these hands I'll tear them apart

158
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:47,274
きれいな月光の光は
The beautiful moonlight

159
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:53,074
ただ静かに 始まりへと朽ちて行くよ
Just quietly decays towards the beginning

160
00:18:53,574 --> 00:18:59,074
閉ざされた憧れは まだ遠くへ
The closed-off longing is still far off

161
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:05,574
闇の中 君と生きた
In the darkness, I lived with you

162
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:11,574
日々の姿
The form of those days

163
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:16,074
優しい歌
A gentle song

164
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:32,074
Misti aso sarti o ria

165
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:14,332
My Soul, Your Beats!
Lyrics, Music: 麻枝 准
My Soul, Your Beats!
Lyrics, Music: Jun Maeda

166
00:20:14,532 --> 00:20:20,032
目覚めては繰り返す 眠い朝は
Waking up and repeating those sleepy mornings...

167
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:27,532
襟のタイをきつく締め
Tightening the tie on my collar

168
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:34,032
教室のドアくぐると ほんの少し
Passing through the classroom door, just a little...

169
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:39,832
胸を張って歩き出せる
I can puff out my chest and start walking

170
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:47,332
そんな日常に 吹き抜ける風
In such daily life, a wind blows through

171
00:20:48,132 --> 00:20:50,832
聞こえた気がした
I felt like I heard it

172
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:56,532
感じた気がしたんだ
I felt like I sensed it

173
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:00,832
震え出す 今この胸で
Starting to tremble, now in this chest

174
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:04,232
もう来る気がした
I felt like it's coming soon

175
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:08,232
幾億の星が消え
Seeing hundreds of millions of stars vanish...

176
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:12,232
去ってくのを
...as they fade away

177
00:21:12,732 --> 00:21:15,332
見送った
I saw them off

178
00:21:15,932 --> 00:21:18,532
手を振った
I waved my hand

179
00:21:19,132 --> 00:21:23,532
よかったねと
Saying, "I'm glad"

180
00:21:24,632 --> 00:21:27,232
廊下の隅見下ろす
Looking down at the corner of the hallway

181
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:30,532
掃除の途中
While cleaning

182
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:33,832
おかしなものだと
I think it's a strange thing

183
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:36,832
思う
Indeed

184
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:40,432
あたしの中の時は
Even though time inside of me

185
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,632
止まってるのに
Has stopped

186
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:46,832
違う日々を
As if I'm living

187
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:50,032
生きてるように
Through different days

188
00:21:50,732 --> 00:21:53,232
埃は雪の
The dust piles up

189
00:21:53,732 --> 00:21:57,032
ように降り積む
Just like snow

190
00:21:57,732 --> 00:22:00,332
待ってる気がした
I felt like I was waiting

191
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:06,032
呼んでる気がしたんだ
I felt like I was being called

192
00:22:07,132 --> 00:22:10,532
震え出す 今この時が
Starting to tremble, now this moment...

193
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:13,932
見つけた気がした
I felt like I found it

194
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:18,232
失われた記憶が
Lost memories

195
00:22:18,732 --> 00:22:21,532
呼び覚ました
Have awakened

196
00:22:22,232 --> 00:22:24,832
物語
A story

197
00:22:25,532 --> 00:22:28,532
永遠の
Eternal

198
00:22:29,232 --> 00:22:33,232
その終わり
And its end

199
00:22:34,032 --> 00:22:36,832
いつの間にか
Before I knew it

200
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:40,132
駆け出してた
I had started running

201
00:22:40,532 --> 00:22:43,232
あなたに手を
My hand was

202
00:22:43,832 --> 00:22:46,432
引かれてた
Being pulled by you

203
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,832
昨日は遠く
Yesterday is far away

204
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:53,032
明日はすぐ
Tomorrow is right here

205
00:22:53,632 --> 00:22:58,232
そんな当たり前に
At such an obvious thing

206
00:22:58,732 --> 00:23:04,532
心が躍った
My heart danced

207
00:23:05,432 --> 00:23:08,032
聞こえた気がした
I felt like I heard it

208
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:14,032
感じた気がしたんだ
I felt like I sensed it

209
00:23:15,332 --> 00:23:18,532
震え出す 今この胸で
Starting to tremble, now in this chest

210
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:22,032
もう来る気がした
I felt like it's coming soon

211
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:26,232
幾千の朝を越え
Crossing over thousands of mornings

212
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:31,232
新しい陽が
A new sun...

213
00:23:32,032 --> 00:23:34,532
待ってる気がした
I felt like I was waiting

214
00:23:35,232 --> 00:23:40,532
呼んでる気がしたんだ
I felt like I was being called

215
00:23:41,432 --> 00:23:44,832
震えてる この魂が
Trembling, this soul of mine

216
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,232
見つけた気がした
I felt like I found it

217
00:23:48,832 --> 00:23:52,032
幾億の夢のように
Like hundreds of millions of dreams

218
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:56,232
消え去れる日を
On the day I can vanish

219
00:23:56,732 --> 00:23:59,432
見送った
I saw them off

220
00:24:00,032 --> 00:24:02,832
手を振った
I waved my hand

221
00:24:03,432 --> 00:24:07,532
ありがとうと
Saying, "Thank you"

222
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:53,032
メフィスト
Lyrics, Music: 薔薇園アヴ
Mephisto
Lyrics, Music: Avu-chan

223
00:24:58,232 --> 00:24:59,932
誰かに化けて...
Disguised as someone else...

224
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:04,140
ラストチャンスに飢えたつま先が
My toes, starved for one last chance...

225
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,690
踊り出すまま駆けたこの夜空
...dashed through the night sky as they danced.

226
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:09,640
並のスタンスじゃ靡かない
With an ordinary stance, I won't sway.

227
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,290
星は宝石の憧れ
The stars are the envy of jewels.

228
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:16,490
浮かぶ涙と汗は血の名残り
The floating tears and sweat are the remains of blood.

229
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,490
目の中でしか泳げない芝居
A play that can only swim within the eyes.

230
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,490
だけどステージが逃がさない
But the stage won't let go.

231
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:26,440
いついつまでも憧れ
Always and forever, a longing.

232
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,140
焦がれているよ
I'm yearning for it.

233
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,865
I've never seen such a liar.

234
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:34,065
生まれつきだっての底なし
Born with a bottomless nature.

235
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:37,390
This lie is love. And this lie is a gift to the world.

236
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,890
誰と生きたか思い出して
Remember who you lived with.

237
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,265
わたしが命を掛けるから
Because I'll put my life on the line...

238
00:25:44,265 --> 00:25:46,890
あげるから
...I'll give it to you.

239
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:52,390
あなたは時間をくれたのでしょう？
You gave me your time, didn't you?

240
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:57,415
あらゆる望みのすべてを叶えたら
If all of every desire is fulfilled...

241
00:25:57,415 --> 00:25:59,890
あぁ果たせたら
Ah, if they could be realized...

242
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,265
あなたに会いたい
I want to see you.

243
00:26:03,265 --> 00:26:06,140
星に願いをかけて
Making a wish upon a star.

244
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,290
戻れないから大切にするの
I'll treasure it because there's no going back.

245
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,390
始めないなら高を括れるよ
If I don't start, I can underestimate it.

246
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,565
楽になる日は末代
The day it gets easier is generations away.

247
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:18,865
日々の中に集まる
Gathering within the days...

248
00:26:18,865 --> 00:26:21,540
悲しい光
...is a sorrowful light.

249
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,590
生まれつきだせば底なし
If born into it, it's bottomless.

250
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,115
This lie is love. And this lie is a gift to the world.

251
00:26:30,115 --> 00:26:33,490
誰を活きたか忘れちゃった！
I've forgotten who I lived as!

252
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:05,490
あなたに命が戻るなら 届くなら
If life returns to you, if it reaches you...

253
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:10,790
わたしはどうなろうと構わないのに
...I wouldn't care what happens to me.

254
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,865
どうやら総ては叶わない
Apparently, not everything will come true.

255
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:17,515
叶わないならば
If it won't come true...

256
00:27:17,515 --> 00:27:20,890
あなたになりたい
...then I want to become you.

257
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,265
星は耽け耽る
The stars grow deeper and deeper.

258
00:27:23,265 --> 00:27:26,190
わたしが命を
I will...

259
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,890
掛けるから あげるから
...put my life on the line, I'll give it to you.

260
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:34,290
あなたは時間をくれたのでしょう？
You gave me your time, didn't you?

261
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:40,390
あらゆる望みのすべてを叶えたら
If all of every desire is fulfilled...

262
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,540
あぁ果たせたら
Ah, if they could be realized...

263
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,390
あなたに会いたい
I want to see you.

264
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,390
星に願いをかけて
Making a wish upon a star.

265
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,315
さあ星の子たちよ よくお眠りなさい
Now, children of the stars, sleep well.

266
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:54,465
さあ星の子たちよ よくお眠りなさい
Now, children of the stars, sleep well.

267
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:57,665
輝きは鈍らない あなたたちならば
The brilliance won't dull, if it's you all.

268
00:27:57,665 --> 00:28:00,865
輝きは鈍らない あなたたちならば
The brilliance won't dull, if it's you all.

269
00:28:00,865 --> 00:28:03,990
さあ星の子たちよ よく狙いなさい
Now, children of the stars, aim well.

270
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,165
さあ星の子たちよ よく狙いなさい
Now, children of the stars, aim well.

271
00:28:07,165 --> 00:28:10,590
またたきを許さない あなたたちならば
I won't allow a flicker, if it's you all.

272
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:14,040
またたきを許さない あなたたちならば
I won't allow a flicker, if it's you all.

煩わしいわ
How bothersome

351
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:06,048
何時しか言の葉は疾うに枯れきって
Before long, words had already withered away

352
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:12,048
事の実があたしに触れている
And the truth of the matter is touching me

353
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:14,548
鏡に映り嘘を描いて
Drawing a lie reflected in the mirror

354
00:33:14,548 --> 00:33:17,548
自らを見失った成れの果て
The end result of losing sight of oneself

Why, oh why, am I dancing here?

359
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:33,548
簡単な事も解らないわ
I don't even understand simple things

360
00:33:33,548 --> 00:33:36,548
あたしって何だっけ
What was I again?

361
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:41,048

Even that is unraveled by the hands of the night

色の目があなを解いている
Eyes of color are unraveling you

369
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:06,048
鏡に映るあたしを欠いて
Lacking the me reflected in the mirror

370
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:09,048
誰もが見間違った虚像
A virtual image that everyone mistook

371
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:12,048
如何して愛なんてものに群がり
Why do they flock to something like love

372
00:34:12,048 --> 00:34:15,048
それを欲して生きるのだ
And live their lives wanting it?

373
00:34:15,048 --> 00:34:20,048
今日も泳いでいる夜の電車が通り去っていく
Today, too, the night train swims by

Dance the night away

何故何故 此処が痛むのでしょう
Why, oh why, does it hurt here?

379
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,856
嘘に絡まっている ただ
Just entangled in lies

380
00:35:03,056 --> 00:35:05,156
簡単なことも解らないわ
I don't even understand simple things

381
00:35:05,256 --> 00:35:07,456

愛のように消える
Vanishing like love

384
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:16,856
さよなら またねと呟いた
I whispered "goodbye, see you again"

The god of musou smiles elegantly

深まる多分もっと face to face
Deepening probably more, face to face

天国も地獄も 気の向くまま進め
Heaven or hell, move forward as you please

432
00:39:07,656 --> 00:39:12,056
その場所で 自分らしくいられるかどうかだ
It's about whether you can be yourself in that place

433
00:39:13,556 --> 00:39:18,056
自分らしく笑えるかどうかだ
It's about whether you can laugh like yourself

The shadows stretching

437
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,585
舗道にならべて
Out across the pavement

438
00:40:37,585 --> 00:40:41,178
夕闇の中を
In the evening twilight

439
00:40:41,178 --> 00:40:44,819
君と歩いてる
I'm walking with you

440
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:47,918
手をつないで
Holding hands

441
00:40:47,918 --> 00:40:51,406
いつまでもずっと
Forever and ever

442
00:40:51,406 --> 00:40:54,184
そばにいられたなら
If I could just stay by your side

443
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:58,264
泣けちゃうくらい
It's enough to make me cry

444
00:40:59,264 --> 00:41:02,364
風が冷たくなって
The wind has grown cold

445
00:41:02,364 --> 00:41:05,764
冬の匂いがした
And it smells like winter

446
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:12,864
そろそろこの街に
Soon, in this town...

447
00:41:12,864 --> 00:41:19,464
君と近付ける季節がくる
...the season where I can be close to you will come

今年、最初の雪の華を
The first snow flowers of this year

449
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:32,464
2人寄り添って
As we draw close to each other

450
00:41:32,464 --> 00:41:38,964
眺めているこの瞬間に
Watching them at this moment

451
00:41:38,964 --> 00:41:43,164
シアワセがあふれだす
Happiness overflows

452
00:41:43,164 --> 00:41:47,464
甘えとか弱さじゃない
It's not dependence or weakness

453
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:50,964
ただ、君を愛してる
I just love you

454
00:41:50,964 --> 00:41:56,864
心からそう思った
I feel it from the bottom of my heart

455
00:42:08,464 --> 00:42:12,364
君がいると
When you're with me

456
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:16,064
どんなことでも
No matter what happens

457
00:42:16,064 --> 00:42:22,464
乗りきれるような気持ちになってる
I feel like I can overcome anything

458
00:42:22,464 --> 00:42:26,564
こんな日々が
That days like these

459
00:42:26,564 --> 00:42:29,864
いつまでもきっと
Will surely continue forever

460
00:42:29,864 --> 00:42:35,464
続いていくことを祈っているよ
I am praying for that

461
00:42:35,864 --> 00:42:39,164
風が窓を揺らした
The wind shook the window

462
00:42:39,164 --> 00:42:43,064
夜は揺り起こして
Waking up the night

463
00:42:43,064 --> 00:42:47,364
どんな悲しいことも
No matter how sad things are

464
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:55,564
僕が笑顔へと変えてあげる
I will change them into smiles for you

465
00:43:01,364 --> 00:43:06,764
舞い落ちてきた雪の華が
The snow flowers that fluttered down

466
00:43:06,764 --> 00:43:09,964
窓の外ずっと
Outside the window, all the while

467
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:15,564
降りやむことを知らずに
Without knowing how to stop falling

468
00:43:15,564 --> 00:43:19,464
僕らの街を染める
They color our town

469
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:27,764
誰かのために何かを
Doing something for someone...

470
00:43:27,764 --> 00:43:35,364
したいと思えるのが愛ということを知った
...I've learned that wanting to do that is what love is

471
00:43:36,764 --> 00:43:42,564
もし君を失ったとしたなら
If I were to lose you

472
00:43:42,564 --> 00:43:49,164
星になって君を照らすだろう
I would become a star and shine on you

473
00:43:49,164 --> 00:43:55,764
笑顔も涙に濡れてる夜も
Both on nights of smiles and nights wet with tears

474
00:43:55,764 --> 00:44:06,864
いつもいつでもそばにいるよ
I will always, always be by your side

475
00:44:07,464 --> 00:44:12,764
今年、最初の雪の華を
The first snow flowers of this year

476
00:44:12,764 --> 00:44:16,864
2人寄り添って
As we draw close to each other

477
00:44:16,864 --> 00:44:23,264
眺めているこの瞬間に
Watching them at this moment

478
00:44:23,264 --> 00:44:27,464
シアワセがあふれだす
Happiness overflows

479
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:31,764
甘えとか弱さじゃない
It's not dependence or weakness

480
00:44:31,764 --> 00:44:35,064
ただ、君とずっと
I just want to stay with you forever

481
00:44:35,064 --> 00:44:38,264
このまま一緒にいたい
Just as we are

482
00:44:38,264 --> 00:44:42,164
素直にそう思える
I can honestly feel that way

483
00:44:42,164 --> 00:44:46,464
この街に降り積もっていく
Accumulating in this town

484
00:44:46,464 --> 00:44:51,364
真っ白な雪の華
Pure white snow flowers

485
00:44:51,364 --> 00:44:55,664
2人の胸にそっと
Gently into our hearts

486
00:44:55,664 --> 00:45:02,364
想い出を描くよ これからも君と
Drawing memories, from now on too, with you

487
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:03,572
想い出を描くよ
I'll paint our memories

488
00:45:03,672 --> 00:45:08,572
これからもずっと...
From now on, and forever...

489
00:45:40,088 --> 00:45:43,183
And that was Yuki no Hana.

490
00:45:43,272 --> 00:45:47,441
Did you guys like the ballad and the gondola
riding all the way here?

491
00:45:47,857 --> 00:45:51,172
Yes, it was a pretty flower...

492
00:45:51,172 --> 00:45:54,472
...flower snowflake, yes, that I rode on all the way here.

493
00:45:55,406 --> 00:45:58,672
And did you guys like the guest part? Yeah!

494
00:45:58,772 --> 00:46:04,649
I sang a lot of songs with the guests and a full on
medley that I put a lot of thought into.

495
00:46:04,953 --> 00:46:09,172
I really want to talk more about the medley and
the concept but I think I won't have enough time for that.

496
00:46:09,272 --> 00:46:12,795
Maybe I'll talk about that in a future stream.

497
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:16,472
And also thank you so much for my lovely
guests for singing with me.

498
00:46:16,572 --> 00:46:21,972
But there's still one more guest song! Yeah! And
that's not the last song by the way, so no worries.

499
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:27,098
There's going to be one more guest song that
you guys are absolutely gonna love!

500
00:46:28,072 --> 00:46:31,272
And also, also!

501
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:35,372
There's going to be one super exciting announcement
that I've been waiting super waiting to show you guys.

502
00:46:35,472 --> 00:46:39,213
So please do look forward to that as well.

503
00:46:40,772 --> 00:46:44,672
なんとね、雪の華とあとゲストパートどうでしたか？
So, how did you like Yuki no Hana and the guest part?

504
00:46:44,772 --> 00:46:50,472
いや、あのメドレーとかね、すごく、とてもあのもう色々考えた上で企画したんで、
I put a lot of thought into planning that medley and everything,

505
00:46:50,872 --> 00:46:56,472
もう本当にね、色々自分の考えたこととかも全部言いたいんですけど、ちょっとそこまで時間ないので、
I really want to tell you all about my ideas, but I don't quite have the time for that here,

506
00:46:56,872 --> 00:47:00,372
とにかくね、みんな気に入っていただけるととても嬉しいです。
Anyway, I'd be very happy if you all enjoyed it.

Now, on to the next song. Please listen to the next song.

514
00:47:49,072 --> 00:47:53,072
罪の名前
Crime of Name

515
00:47:49,072 --> 00:47:53,072
Lyrics, Music: ryo (supercell)

516
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:08,043
お目目の女神様が目を留めた
A goddess with eyes caught sight

517
00:48:08,372 --> 00:48:12,772
なんて可愛い赤ん坊だろう
What a cute baby

518
00:48:13,672 --> 00:48:18,472
そうだわ あの子に魔法をかけて 遊びましょう
I know, let's put a spell on that child and play

519
00:48:36,472 --> 00:48:41,572
くぼんだ両目 痩せ過ぎな体
Sunken eyes, a skeletal body

520
00:48:41,872 --> 00:48:46,872
私を見れば 誰しもが言うのです
Anyone who looks at me says

521
00:48:47,072 --> 00:48:54,672
化け物 お前は 同じ人間じゃないんだよと
"Monster, you're not a human like the rest of us."

522
00:48:58,572 --> 00:49:03,872
悲しいなんて思わない だって
I don't think it's sad, because

523
00:49:04,272 --> 00:49:13,872
思えば ほら また 涙があふれて 震える
When I think about it, look, tears overflow and I tremble

524
00:49:15,072 --> 00:49:20,372
もしも願いが一つ叶うなら
If I could have one wish come true

525
00:49:20,572 --> 00:49:26,172
世界でたった一人だけの友達を
I'd want just one friend in the whole world

526
00:49:26,572 --> 00:49:31,572
生きることは素晴らしいこと
That living is a wonderful thing

527
00:49:31,772 --> 00:49:37,472
そんな風に私も思ってみたい
I want to be able to think that way too

528
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:05,080
罪の名前
The Name of the Sin

529
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:05,180
ねずみはなんで嫌われるのでしょう
Why are mice so hated?

530
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:10,580
彼らは笑って「汚いからだろう」
They laugh and say, "Because they're dirty."

531
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,580
それなら答えて
If that's the case, then answer me

532
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:19,080
目のみえない僕のために
for the sake of my blind eyes.

533
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:27,580
見て見ぬふりに理不尽な差別
Turning a blind eye and unreasonable discrimination,

534
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:32,580
それでねずみと何が違うの
how is that any different from the mice?

535
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:38,280
嘲笑う彼らに続けて言うんだ
Tell those who mock you...

536
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,280
「二度とするな」
"Don't ever do that again."

537
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,280
嬉しいのになぜでしょうか
I'm happy, so why is it?

538
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:54,880
だって涙がほらやっぱり
Because, you see, tears are...

539
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,880
溢れてくるのです
...still overflowing.

540
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,880
もしかなりたいものになれるなら
If I could become anything I wanted,

541
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:12,080
あなたの前では普通の女の子に
I'd want to be just an ordinary girl in front of you.

542
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:17,380
思えば思うほどに胸が苦しい
The more I think about it, the more my heart aches.

543
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:24,580
どうして私は私なのでしょうか
Why must I be myself?

544
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:34,380
「君は優しい女の子なのに
"Even though you're a kind girl,

545
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,380
いつも自分を責める
you're always blaming yourself.

546
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:40,380
慰めてあげたい君を
I want to comfort you.

547
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:43,280
そうだ、ここに咲いた花を君に捧げよう
I know, I'll give you this flower that bloomed here.

548
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:49,080
それは見事な白いユリの花」
It's a magnificent white lily."

549
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,880
さあ、と君の近くに寄っていくよ
He says, and draws closer to you.

550
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:16,880
運命の女神様は意地悪だ
The Goddess of Fate is cruel.

551
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,080
醜いあの子を見たらどんな顔
What kind of face would she make

552
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,580
するんでしょう
if she saw that ugly child?

553
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,580
見物ね
It'll be quite a sight.

554
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:33,280
迷子、迷子な俺と魔法をかける
I, a lost soul, shall cast a spell.

555
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:39,080
花は黒く淀んだ色に染まる
The flower is dyed in a murky black color.

556
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:44,280
それは不吉な黒いユリの花
It's an ominous black lily.

557
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,080
「お前へこれから贈り物だ
"Here's a gift for you.

558
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:53,280
そら、血の匂いさ」
Look, it's the scent of blood."

559
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,880
ああ、これはきっと罰です
Ah, this must be my punishment.

560
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,880
だって私が身の程知らずに
Because I unknowingly...

561
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:12,880
恋をしたから
...fell in love.

562
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,080
いっそ、死んでしまえばいいのでしょう
I should probably just die.

563
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:25,280
あなたは叫ぶ「泣かないで、僕がずっと」
You shout, "Don't cry, I'll always..."

564
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,880
「死ぬまでそばにいるからさ」
"...be by your side until I die."

565
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:38,280
「今日から君は普通の女の子さ」
"From today on, you're just an ordinary girl."

566
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:43,080
「それに見えるよ」
"That's how you look to me."

567
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:49,580
悪夢のような魔法はほら
Look, the nightmare-like spell...

568
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:58,080
解けたみたい
...seems to have been broken.

569
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,280
And that was "Tsumi no Namae" with my Promise ladies!

570
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,080
Did you guys like it?

571
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:24,680
Let's just say that that was the last song—or I said that that was the last song, even though I did not say that a few minutes ago.

572
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,080
Ah, I think this live is over already! What should I do?

573
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,980
どうしようかな...
What should I do?

574
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,880
えーっ？
Ehh?

575
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,580
You guys want more?

576
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,980
しょうがないなあ！
Oh, fine then!

577
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:44,080
Or more like, I still have this exciting announcement to make!

578
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,980
Can you guys guess what it is?

579
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,180
Yeah! It is a new original song!

580
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:54,080
Yeah, it is a new song called "Twilight," written by Yunosuke-san,

581
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:57,280
with lyrics written by Gyuniku-san.

582
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,080
It is a really, really, really cool song, and...

583
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:05,238
...with a really, really cool MV that will be shown right after this live!

584
00:55:05,238 --> 00:55:07,538
Yeah! So when you finish watching this,

585
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:10,588
please go directly straight to the MV,

586
00:55:10,588 --> 00:55:12,788
'cause you will regret it if you don't.

587
00:55:12,788 --> 00:55:16,538
It is a song that is based on this angel-devil theme

588
00:55:16,538 --> 00:55:20,388
that this live is also based on, or more like I based the live's theme to the song.

589
00:55:20,388 --> 00:55:24,488
So if you put them two together, it becomes a work of art! Yes.

590
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:28,538
But before you go to the MV after this, I will be performing...

591
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:30,238
Yes.

592
00:55:30,238 --> 00:55:33,488
A one last song for you guys, which is obviously,

593
00:55:33,488 --> 00:55:37,538
obviously TwiLight. I will be releasing... I will be performing

594
00:55:37,538 --> 00:55:41,438
the song for you guys right after this. So I hope you guys enjoy that

595
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:45,388
as my last song for today. I will be saying this in Japanese now.

596
00:55:45,388 --> 00:55:47,438
えっと、では、えっとね、なんと...
Well, so, actually...

597
00:55:47,438 --> 00:55:50,938
新曲出します！TwiLightという曲になっています。
I'm releasing a new song! It's called TwiLight.

598
00:55:50,938 --> 00:55:54,138
えっと、ゆのすけさんに書いていただき、えっと、歌詞は
It was composed by Yunosuke-san, and the lyrics were written by

610
00:56:44,313 --> 00:56:47,038
Just as 私はいま
Just as I am now

00:56:47,038 --> 00:56:50,438
私である事実も
The fact that I am myself

612
00:56:50,438 --> 00:56:54,388
定められない 定まらない
Cannot be defined, is not defined

613
00:56:54,388 --> 00:56:58,838
存在なら That’s fine with me
If that's my existence, that's fine with me

614
00:56:59,138 --> 00:57:02,538
Heads or tails 保つだけじゃ意味なく

Heads or tails それだけじゃなく
Heads or tails, it's not just that

616
00:57:06,438 --> 00:57:10,038
Fallen angel, Ascended devil

617
00:57:10,038 --> 00:57:13,638
あらゆる姿を
Every form

00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:17,088

I'm seeking

619
00:57:17,088 --> 00:57:20,538

00:57:20,538 --> 00:57:23,988
求めーている
I'm seeking

621
00:57:23,988 --> 00:57:27,538

622
00:57:27,538 --> 00:57:32,038
TwiLight 昂く拡がる
TwiLight, spreading high

623
00:57:32,038 --> 00:57:35,438

O, twilight of the moment

624
00:57:35,438 --> 00:57:38,638
Try out 掛け違えても
Try out, even if things are misplaced

625
00:57:38,638 --> 00:57:44,088

昏くの声で 羽ばたいた
I spread my wings with a dark voice

628
00:57:57,238 --> 00:58:00,738

Most identities are born from mistakes

629
00:58:00,738 --> 00:58:04,288
存在じゃないのか
Aren't they existence?

632
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:15,538
Fallen angel, Ascended devil

633
00:58:15,538 --> 00:58:19,438
歪な形を
The distorted shape

634
00:58:19,438 --> 00:58:22,888
求めーている
I'm seeking

635
00:58:22,888 --> 00:58:26,588
浸した熱を 捩るように
As if twisting the soaked heat

636
00:58:41,338 --> 00:58:44,938
一長一短は チグハグの定義なんて
Merits and demerits, the definition of being mismatched

637
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:48,538
主張なだけで
Is just an assertion

638
00:58:48,538 --> 00:58:52,138
白と黒が 大切なのは
That white and black are important

639
00:58:52,138 --> 00:58:56,488
わかるけど 私は
I understand, but I...

640
00:58:56,488 --> 00:59:00,088
私はどこ 私は誰
Where am I? Who am I?

641
00:59:00,088 --> 00:59:03,538
私は何者か
What am I?

642
00:59:03,538 --> 00:59:07,038
私はいま 私はいま
I am now, I am now

643
00:59:07,038 --> 00:59:10,488
私へと混ざり合うの
Mixing into myself

644
00:59:10,488 --> 00:59:14,488
相反的な翼で
With conflicting wings

645
00:59:14,488 --> 00:59:18,088
高くへと飛び立てば
If I fly high

646
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:21,588
曖昧なのも 潔く
Being ambiguous, cleanly

647
00:59:21,588 --> 00:59:25,088
まとめて映るから
Because it's all reflected together

648
00:59:25,088 --> 00:59:29,038
TwiLight 両手に乗せた
TwiLight, in both hands I hold

649
00:59:29,038 --> 00:59:32,488
綯い交ぜを解く
Untying the mixture

650
00:59:32,488 --> 00:59:35,938
Try out 掛け違えても
Try out, even if things are misplaced

651
00:59:35,938 --> 00:59:40,438
生性は要らない
Correction is not needed

652
00:59:40,438 --> 00:59:44,238
Be oneself, Be myself, Revisit ふたつで
Be oneself, Be myself, Revisit with two

653
00:59:44,238 --> 00:59:48,238
Be oneself, Be myself, ひとつな
Be oneself, Be myself, one

654
00:59:48,238 --> 00:59:52,238
Be oneself, Be myself, Revisit こころの
Be oneself, Be myself, Revisit the heart's

655
00:59:52,238 --> 00:59:56,588
指標だから
Because it's the indicator

656
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,196
愛してる
I love you,

657
01:00:01,296 --> 01:00:03,396
