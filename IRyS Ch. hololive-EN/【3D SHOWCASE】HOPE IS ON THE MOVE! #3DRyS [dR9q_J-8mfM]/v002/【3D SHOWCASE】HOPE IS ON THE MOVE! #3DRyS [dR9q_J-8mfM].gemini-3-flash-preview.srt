00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,200
Darkness will fade away,

3
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,500
Light will guide your way,

4
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Hope has descended and

5
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,500
...you are not alone.

6
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,000
Caesura of Despair
Lyrics / Composition: buzzG

7
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,500
道と雨が織りなす
A contrast woven by

8
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,800
コントラスト
the road and the rain

9
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,000
絶望の終わりを願うように
As if wishing for the end of despair

10
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,000
ここにいるよ
I am here,

11
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,500
歌ってるよ
I am singing

12
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,000
夜明けの果てを
Looking towards the edge of dawn

13
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,500
こぼれ落ちた
The spilled

14
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,800
黄昏のエレジー
twilight elegy

15
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,000
凍えた心
Saying farewell

16
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,200
涙にサヨナラ
to the frozen heart's tears

17
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,200
きっと Despair
I'll sing so that despair

18
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,500
晴れるように　歌うから
will surely clear up

19
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,000
そして Make a wish
And then I'll make a wish

20
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,800
鮮やかに　飾るから
and decorate it vividly

21
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,500
Darkness will fade away,

22
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,500
Hope will lead your way,

23
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
I'm here to chant the

24
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
melodies for you.

25
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,500
月と星が彩るサテライト
A satellite colored by the moon and stars

26
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,000
暗闇も君となら飛べるよ
If I'm with you, I can fly even through darkness

27
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,000
夜だからこそ
Because it is night,

28
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,200
輝ける
there must be light

29
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,500
光もあるでしょう
that can shine through

30
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,000
忘れないで　君のためのセレナーデ
Don't forget, a serenade just for you

31
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,500
壊れかけた　夢の続きをここで見よう
Let's see the rest of the broken dream here

32
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,500
Resize your story,

33
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,500
Time is running too fast and left behind.

34
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,000
It's all mine.

35
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,808
運命に駆け寄っていこう
Let's run toward destiny

36
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:07,008
黒い指に沈む君の手に
Into your hand sinking into black fingers

37
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,508
届け
Reach out

38
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,508
願ってるよ 未来の足音
I'm wishing, the footsteps of the future

39
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:41,208
手と手をつなごう オーケストラ
Let's join hands, orchestra

40
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,508
懐かしくも淡い歌で
With a nostalgic and faint song

41
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:47,208
奏でて
Playing

42
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:50,008
奏でて
Playing

43
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:55,008
夜明けが聞こえる
The dawn can be heard

44
00:05:56,508 --> 00:06:01,808
Believe in destiny 約束を果たすから
Believe in destiny, because I'll fulfill my promise

45
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:07,508
いつか理由に 語りきれないほど響いて
One day, let it resonate so much that it can't be told as a reason

46
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:13,408
嘆きも後悔も 笑い飛ばそうよ
Let's laugh off the grief and regrets

47
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,808
そんな形に 希望と名付けよう
Let's name such forms "hope"

48
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:21,008
きっと
Surely

49
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:26,508
Despair 晴れるように歌うから
I'll sing so that despair clears up

50
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:32,008
そして Make a wish 鮮やかに飾るから
And make a wish, because I'll decorate it vividly

51
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:37,408
君だけの声と 重ねるように
So that it overlaps with only your voice

52
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:43,008
こんな世界だって 側にいるよ
Even in a world like this, I'll be by your side

53
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:45,808
Darkness fade away

54
00:06:46,108 --> 00:06:48,408
Iris will light your way

55
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:53,608
Our journey has only just begun right now

56
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:24,008
HiRyS! It's IRyS!

57
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:28,508

3Dお披露目に来てくださってありがとうございます！
Thank you so much for coming to my 3D showcase!

60
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:42,308
I fell from a very, very high height, but I got wings so I'm fine.

61
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:44,808
落ちたけど全然大丈夫だよ！
I fell but I'm totally fine!

62

Thank you! Please check out my beautiful stage in the middle of a big city,

64
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:56,508
and that beautiful red tower behind, yes!

65
00:07:57,008 --> 00:08:00,608
めっちゃ美しい赤いタワーと、すごい、めちゃくちゃ都会です。
With that beautiful red tower, it's very urban.

66
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:03,008
IRyS、都会っ子です。
IRyS is a city girl.

67
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,508
I am a city girl. Very much a city girl.

68
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:10,508
I'm going to be singing a lot of songs on this stage. I'm so excited!

69
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:14,008
Alrighty, so this is just the start,

00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:29,808
There's going to be a lot of fun stuff.

Alrighty then. I can move so much now!

75
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:35,308
Look at me! Look at this beautiful IRyS movement!

76
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:38,508
Like I said in my hype, beautiful IRyS movement!

77
00:08:39,508 --> 00:08:43,008
Anyways, I'm going to be singing a lot more.

78
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:47,008
So, let's get to it then, yeah? Let's get to the next song.

79
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,008
Alrighty, 次の曲聴いてください。
Alrighty, please listen to the next song.

80
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:51,508
Shangri-La.

81
00:09:13,508 --> 00:09:17,008
ほら、風が吹いているのだろう
Look, the wind must be blowing

82
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:22,208
見渡す夢の跡
Looking over the remains of a dream

83
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:27,508
サヨナラ 蒼き日々よ
Goodbye, blue days

84
00:09:32,008 --> 00:09:44,008
Shangri-La

85
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:50,508
流れに身を任せ いつか大人になってゆき
Leaving myself to the flow, becoming an adult one day

86
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:56,508
少しずつ汚れてゆく事なの？
Is it about becoming a little dirty bit by bit?

87
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:59,808
熟した果実が...
A ripened fruit...

88
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,416
...だけ 選ばれて
...only, I was chosen

89
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:04,416
鳴り響いた
It resounded

90
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,316
叫ばれて
It was shouted

91
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:09,616
飲み込まれる前に
Before being swallowed up

92
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:14,316
僕らは目指した シャングリラ
We aimed for Shangri-La

93
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:17,916
欲望を抑えきれずに
Unable to restrain our desires

94
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:21,116
空想にまみれた
Covered in fantasies

95
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:24,516
自由を求め続けた
We continued to seek freedom

96
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:27,916
今なら言えるだろう
I can probably say it now

97
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:31,016
ここがユートピア
This place is Utopia

98
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:36,716
さよなら 蒼き日々よ
Goodbye, blue days

99
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,516
哀切な顔
A sorrowful face

100
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:52,416
踏み台にしてまでも
Even if I make it a stepping stone

101
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,316
一番高いリンゴ
The highest apple

102
00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:58,316
掴みたかった
I wanted to grasp it

103
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:01,316
失くしてから気付く
Realizing after losing it

104
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:04,316
尊いもの
Something precious

105
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:07,416
幼い僕らは
Our young selves

106
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:12,016
的外れだらけさ
Were full of misses

107
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,916
満ち足りた日々の 制圧は
The suppression of satisfying days

108
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:19,416
情緒不安定になる
Makes one emotionally unstable

109
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,416
傷を負ってでも
Even if I get hurt

110
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,516
羽ばたきたいと願うよ
I wish to flap my wings

111
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:28,916
愚かでもいいだろう
It's fine to be foolish

112
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:32,316
見渡す夢の跡
The traces of dreams looked upon

113
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:37,916
さよなら 蒼き日々よ
Goodbye, blue days

114
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:09,216
輝く空は
The shining sky

115
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:12,316
無邪気さを装い
Pretends to be innocent

116
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:18,416
全てを知っていた
It knew everything

117
00:12:23,616 --> 00:12:27,016
僕らは目指した シャングリラ
We aimed for Shangri-La

118
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:30,516
欲望を抑えきれずに
Unable to restrain our desires

119
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,816
空想にまみれた
Covered in fantasies

120
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:37,016
自由を求め続けた
We continued to seek freedom

121
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:40,416
距離を置いてこそ
Only by keeping a distance

122
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,816
自由の大きさを知る
Do we know the scale of freedom

123
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:48,816
未熟な心は それさえ分からないまま
Our immature hearts still don't even know that

124
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:52,316
今なら言えるだろう
I can probably say it now

125
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:55,416
ここがユートピア
This place is Utopia

126
00:12:55,416 --> 00:13:01,016
さよなら 蒼き日々よ
Goodbye, blue days

127
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:34,516
せーの！
One, two!

128
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:36,416
でも そんなんじゃ だめ
But that's not good enough

129
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,416
もう そんなんじゃ ほら
Look, that's no longer enough

130
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:42,516
心は進化するよ もっともっと
My heart will evolve, more and more

132
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,616
言葉にすれば消えちゃう関係なら
If it's a relationship that vanishes if put into words

133
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:02,916
言葉を消せばいいやって
I thought I should just erase the words

134
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,116
思ってた 恐れてた
That's what I thought, that's what I feared

135
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:07,116
だけど あれ？ なんか違うかも...
But wait? Maybe something is different...

136
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:09,116
せんりのみちもいっぽから！
A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step!

137
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,216
石のようにかたい そんな意志で
With a will as hard as a stone

138
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:13,616
ちりもつもればやまとなでしこ？
If dust piles up, it becomes a Yamato Nadeshiko?

139
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:15,616
しんぬきで、いや死ぬ気で！
With all my soul, no, like my life depends on it!

140
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:17,616
ふわふわり ふわふわる
Fluffy and light, floating and soft

141
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:20,116
あなたが名前を呼ぶ それだけで
Just you calling my name

142
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:22,616
宙へ浮かぶ
Makes me float into the air

143
00:14:22,616 --> 00:14:25,116
ふわふわる ふわふわり
Floating and soft, fluffy and light

144
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:28,116
あなたが笑っている それだけで
Just you smiling

145
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:30,616
笑顔になる
Makes me smile too

146
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:34,616
神様 ありがとう
God, thank you

147
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:38,616
運命のいたずらでも
Even if it's a prank of fate

148
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:42,616
めぐり逢えたことが
The fact that we met

149
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:46,616
しあわせなの
Makes me happy

150
00:14:46,616 --> 00:14:48,516
でも そんなんじゃ だめ
But that's not good enough

151
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:50,516
もう そんなんじゃ ほら
Look, that's no longer enough

152
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:54,616
心は進化するよ もっともっと
My heart will evolve, more and more

153
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:56,616
そう そんなんじゃ やだ
That's right, that's not enough, I don't want that

154
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:58,616
ねえ そんなんじゃ まだ
Hey, that's still not enough

155
00:14:58,616 --> 00:15:00,016
私のこと見ててね ずっとずっと
Please keep watching me, forever and ever

156
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:02,824
私のこと 見ててね ずっとずっと
Please keep your eyes on me, forever and ever.

157
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:22,524
私の中のあなたほど あなたの中の私の存在は
As much as you exist within me...

158
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:26,524
まだまだ大きくないこともわかってるけれど
...I know that I don't yet exist as much within you.

159
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:30,824
今この同じ瞬間 共有してる実感
But the feeling of sharing this very moment right now...

160
00:15:30,824 --> 00:15:33,324
ちりも積もればやまとなでしこ！
If dust piles up, it becomes a Yamato Nadeshiko!

161
00:15:33,324 --> 00:15:34,924
略して？ ちりつもやまとなでこ！
Shortened? Chiritsumo Yamato Nadeko!

162
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:39,024
くらくらり くらくるる あなたを見上げたら
Dizzy-dizzy, spinning around, when I look up at you...

163
00:15:39,024 --> 00:15:42,524
それだけで まぶしすぎて
...just that alone is too dazzling.

164
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:46,024
くらくるる くらくらり あなたを想っている
Spinning around, dizzy-dizzy, just thinking of you...

165
00:15:46,024 --> 00:15:50,524
それだけで とけてしまう
...is enough to make me melt away.

166
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:54,524
神様ありがとう 運命のいたずらでも
Thank you, God, even if it's a prank of fate...

167
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:58,524
めぐり逢えたことが しあわせなの
...being able to meet you makes me happy.

168
00:16:07,524 --> 00:16:11,024
コイスルキセツハ
In the season of being in love...

169
00:16:11,024 --> 00:16:14,724

With eyes of being in love...

173
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:31,024

00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:35,024
コイスルオトメハ
As a maiden in love...

175
00:16:35,024 --> 00:16:38,824
ヨクバリ circulation
...it's a greedy circulation.

176
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:44,524
ふわふわり ふわふわる あなたが名前を呼ぶ
Fluffy-fluffy, floating around, when you call my name...

177
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:48,824
それだけで 宙へ浮かぶ
...just that alone makes me float into the sky.

178
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:52,524
ふわふわる ふわふわり あなたが笑っている
Floating around, fluffy-fluffy, when you are smiling...

179

めぐり逢えたことが しあわせなの
...being able to meet you makes me happy.

182
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:32,424
でも そんなんじゃ だめ もう そんなんじゃ ほら
But that won't do, that won't do anymore, look...

183
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:36,524
心は進化するよ もっともっと
...my heart will evolve, more and more.

184
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:41,024
そう そんなんじゃ やだ ねえ そんなんじゃ まだ
Yes, I don't like it like that, hey, not like that yet...

185
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:45,324
私のこと見ててね ずっとずっと
...please keep your eyes on me, forever and ever.

186
00:17:54,224 --> 00:17:57,024
Whew! And that was two songs in a row. Let's go!

187
00:17:57,024 --> 00:18:01,024
Shangri-La and Ren'ai Circulation! Woo!

188
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:04,324
Ah, I hope you guys liked those.

189
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:08,024
I really like the gap between the two songs, you know,

190
00:18:08,024 --> 00:18:12,324
Shangri-La from Fafner, watch Fafner, bam, it's like bam!

191
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:16,424
And then Ren'ai Circulation is like ooh, azatoi.

192
00:18:17,324 --> 00:18:22,024
Alrighty then! Now that... after singing two songs,

193
00:18:22,024 --> 00:18:24,724
I think it's time to welcome our very first guests!

194
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:31,024
Welcome, my friends from Hololive English Council!

195
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:34,024
IRyS!

196
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:38,024
IRyS! You did so great! Congratulations!

197
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:41,024
Congratulations! Oh my god!

198
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:43,024
You look so great!

199
00:18:43,024 --> 00:18:45,024
You look so cute!

200
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,324
嬉しい！
I'm so happy!

201
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:51,024
Alrighty guys, please introduce yourselves one by one.

202
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:53,424
Okay! Who's going first? Me?

203
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:56,024
Me go first? Okay!

204
00:18:56,024 --> 00:19:00,024
What's up! It's Hakos Baelz from Hololive EN Council,

205
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:02,024
representing Chaos!

206
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:05,524
Congratulations on 3D IRyS! Yay!

207
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:08,524
ありがとう！ Alrighty, next up, who wants to go next?
Thank you! Alrighty, next up, who wants to go next?

208
00:19:08,824 --> 00:19:10,524
Me! Me! Me!

209
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,824
Yes! Okay!

210
00:19:11,824 --> 00:19:13,524
You! You go you!

211
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:17,024
Oh hi! Oh hi! I'm Nanashi Mumei from

212
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:20,024
Hololive English Council, the Guardian of Civilization!

213
00:19:20,024 --> 00:19:23,024
IRyS you look so nice today!

214
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:24,724
Thank you, Mumei!

215
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:27,424
Alrighty, and then next, who wants to go next?

216
00:19:27,424 --> 00:19:30,024
Konfuna! It's me, Ceres Fauna!

217
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:33,424
IRyS, I'm obsessed with you right now.

218
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:34,524
Oh, really?

219
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:37,424
You're like a princess of my dreams.

220
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:39,024
Really? A princess?

221
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:41,024
お姫様、お姫様、お姫様。
A princess, a princess, a princess.

222
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:42,524
お姫様ですか？
A princess?

223
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:44,024
姫、姫！
Princess, princess!

224
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,524
The way you say "hime"

225
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:50,024
sounds a little sarcastic. Thank you.

226
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:52,524
Alrighty then, last but not least.

227
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:56,524
Oh hello everyone, it's Ouro Kronii from Hololive English Council,

228
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:59,024
the Warden of Time. IRyS...

229
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,866
Really, really liked your Shangri-La.

230
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,493
Yes! Thank you!

231
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,863
You were so out there.

232
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:06,156
Thank you.

233
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:10,550
Oh my god! Oh my god! Crazy.

234
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,786
Arigato. So cute. Oh my god.
Thank you. So cute. Oh my god.

235
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:15,629
Thank you guys! All righty then...

236
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:19,897
...since I have you guys here,
we are going to play a game with IRyS.

237
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:21,088
Yes. A game?

238
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:24,507
A game! What game?
A game that will test my acting skills. Yes!

239
00:20:24,507 --> 00:20:30,169
It is called the "Let's test IRyS's acting skill"
game. Yeah, we didn't think of a name.

240
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:33,456
All righty. So first off...

241
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:39,027
...I will take some of the most iconic Japanese food,
which is, of course...

242
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:43,117
...Sushi! And green tea! Yay!

243
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,396
Whoa! Oh my god!

244
00:20:45,396 --> 00:20:47,918
Thank goodness, I was getting hungry.

245
00:20:47,918 --> 00:20:51,611
I know. I ate sandwich,
but I'm going to eat sushi after this. Yes.

246
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:53,638
I mean, during this, during this. Yes. Nice.

247
00:20:53,638 --> 00:20:57,203
Alrighty, so for sushi, we have tuna,
or the maguro...

248
00:20:57,203 --> 00:21:00,260
...wait, is the sushi showing up anytime soon?

249
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,391
Where's the sushi? Cast the spell! Magic sushi!

250
00:21:03,391 --> 00:21:08,599
Magic... magic spell! Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo!

251
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:15,573
Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo! Sushi! Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo!
Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo! Sushi!

252
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:18,604
Oh, there we go! It worked!

253
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:21,879
It worked! Nice! Not only is she a princess,
she's a magic princess!

254
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:24,501
She is a magic princess!

255
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:27,279
Oh my goodness, it's gigantic!
Bigger than your face, bro.

256
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,436
Yeah, we're going to eat a lot of sushi today.

257
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:34,288
Alrighty, so there's the maguro,
and then there's the ika, the squid.

258
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:38,244
マグロのお寿司とイカのお寿司
どちらに大量ワサビが入っているでしょうか？
Tuna Sushi and Squid Sushi
Which has the most wasabi?

259
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:38,244
I'll eat them one by one, but one of those two
has a huge buttload of wasabi in it...

260
00:21:38,244 --> 00:21:40,489
...while the other one doesn't.

261
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:43,464
But I'm going to try hard and pretend...

262
00:21:43,464 --> 00:21:47,889
...actually, I'm going to pretend that both of them
have a lot of wasabi in it. Yes.

263
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:54,073
And you're supposed to guess which one actually
has the wasabi in it. Oh! Okay, okay.

264
00:21:54,073 --> 00:22:00,209
Alrighty, first off, I'm going to eat the maguro.

265
00:22:00,209 --> 00:22:04,313
Oh, you're starting already?
She's doing it already! Okay.

266
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:07,443
It's alright, she's easy to read.
Guys, it's fine. Watch her body language.

267
00:22:07,443 --> 00:22:14,691
Oh! Oh! Okay. Okay. Okay.
Is she... is she for real?

268
00:22:14,691 --> 00:22:22,218
What? Oh, okay. Okay.
Well, that's convincing!

269
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:26,147
That is pretty convincing. Oh!

270
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:29,645
鼻に... Oh, the sniffing, the sniffing!
The nose... Oh, the sniffing, the sniffing!

271
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:35,436
Pay attention, guys. Pay attention.
Did she just sniffle? To eat it?

272
00:22:35,436 --> 00:22:38,289
She's on her... she's on her knees! Okay.

273
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:44,236
Is this too much? Is this too dramatic?
You think she's overreacting?

274
00:22:44,236 --> 00:22:48,368
Oh my god, the aftertaste! Holy...!

275
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:51,304
Okay, okay, okay. Not bad, not bad. Alright, alright.

276
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:56,583
We're just like, analyzing her while she could
be in pain. She's so great.

277
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,115
The body movement! That was very convincing.

278
00:22:59,115 --> 00:23:03,283
That was the maguro. That was the maguro. Okay,
now we're going to have the squid, the squid.

279
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:08,595
Alright, she's starting.

280
00:23:13,554 --> 00:23:16,145
Oh! Oh!

281
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:19,499
Is she... too quickly? Too quickly, too early.

282
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:22,551
I think that was too quick.
I think that was too quick to turn easy.

283
00:23:22,551 --> 00:23:26,573
Because, like, you know when you eat wasabi...
oh, she's back up.

284
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:30,366
Yeah, I think... her nose doesn't sound
blocked this time either.

285
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:34,059
You know how like when you sniff up?
Yeah, there should be like that sound.

286
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:39,228
Oh, she's overreacting! Too much, too much!
Overreacting after we said that!

287
00:23:39,228 --> 00:23:44,301
Oh! I know that ika's going somewhere.

288
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:48,099
What? Oh, why is she sniffling so much now?

289
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:51,386
Hmm, are you overly aware? Is this reverse psychology?

290
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:55,384
I mean, I'd still be sniffling, even if this wasn't
the one that had the wasabi.

291
00:23:55,384 --> 00:24:00,114
Even if, perhaps, this didn't have the wasabi,
I'd still be sniffling...

292
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:04,320
...because the first one was so wasabi-ful!
Exactly. Sniffling.

293
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,443
All righty guys, guess!
Guess which one had the wasabi in it!

294
00:24:08,443 --> 00:24:12,424
I'm going to go with maguro. Maguro. First one. Tuna?

295
00:24:12,424 --> 00:24:18,557
Final answer? Yeah, tuna. Tuna. Yeah.

296
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:22,449
Alrighty then, I guess I'll take that then.
Drumroll please!

297
00:24:22,449 --> 00:24:30,436
Bam! Pin-pon! Yes!
The wasabi was in the maguro!

298
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:34,288
It was a lot of wasabi, holy smokes! Are you okay?

299
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:40,108
Like the moment I swallowed it, I was like,
"Oh shoot, I'm done". I was crying.

300
00:24:40,108 --> 00:24:44,236
Okay. Alrighty then.

301
00:24:44,236 --> 00:24:49,038
You guys, so if you get the right answer,
you get to request a pose for me!

302
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,583
So request away! Wait, do we get a pose each?

303
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:57,513
Uh, no, one pose from all of you, I think.
Oh, just one? Do you have any ideas?

304
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,840
I have one if no one else has one.

305
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,540
Oh!

306
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,040
You go, you go.

307
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,540
Okay. Alright, I don't know exactly
what this pose is,

308
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,040
but it has a name.

309
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,540
Mermaid Pose?

310
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,340
Whatever I think that is...

311
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,040
Mermaid pose?

312
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,840
Mermaid pose!

313
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,540
There's no reference.

314
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,840
Mermaid pose?

315
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,040
No reference?

316
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,540
I'm just gonna go for it with the name.

317
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,540
I have nothing to give you,
just based off the name, yeah.

318
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,540
Let's see Mermaid-RyS.

319
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,540
Give us your best mermaid.

320
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
Okay.

321
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,540
Okay. Since it's a mermaid,
there's probably no legs, right?

322
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,340
So... alright.

323
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,040
Pretend that I don't have legs, so... fins.

324
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,040
Can you make them flopping more sexy?

325
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,540
Yeah.

326
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,040
You look like a fish.

327
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,540
You literally look like a fish out of water.

328
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,840
That doesn't look like...

329
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,340
My knees!

330
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,040
Where's the maid part?

331
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Stop! That's not a mermaid!

332
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,540
Alrighty, that was... that was my mermaid pose.

333
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,540
This doesn't look right, I know.

334
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,540
It doesn't.

335
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,540
Was it accurate?

336
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,540
Was it exactly what you were thinking?

337
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,540
Thank you.

338
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,540
It was around there. It was around there, yeah.

339
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,540
Alrighty then.

340
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,540
Magic cup. The magic cup.

341
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,040
Shut up! Shut up!

342
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Alright, next up, tea.

343
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,540
Okay. First...

344
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,540
so one of the tea is very bitter
while the other one's probably not.

345
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,540
So we're gonna try it out, yeah?

346
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,040
I'm gonna pretend that both are equally bitter,
so it's the same trick.

347
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,540
Okay. Yes.

348
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,840
Which one was actually bitter.

349
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,540
Okay. Starting with the yunomi.

350
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,540
Pick it up in her hand? Yeah.

351
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,040
Ah, that was refreshing.

352
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,340
Phew! Okay.

353
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,540
Nice, she's going the other route. Okay.

354
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,540
Oh yeah, okay, okay.

355
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,040
It was very, very nice to eat this
after some spicy sushi.

356
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,540
Ah, that was good.

357
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,540
Did you just say eat this?

358
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,540
She's eating the tea?

359
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,540
I'm drinking!

360
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,040
She's nervous, she's lying!

361
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,840
Oh my god!

362
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,540
Ah! See, I'm taking...

363
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,540
I took another sip from this one, okay?

364
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,540
That was still my first one. Okay,
next one, second one.

365
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,040
From the glass.

366
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
B. Tea B.

367
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,340
Ah... ah...

368
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,540
Ah, that's some other... some good tea too.

369
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,040
It tastes slightly different.

370
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,040
I honestly can't tell the difference
between these two.

371
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,340
Nice refreshment after singing.

372
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,540
Alrighty.

373
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,840
Which one do you guys think it is
from my reaction?

374
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,340
They both look great.

375
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,540
Great tea.

376
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,540
Hmm... I think it's the first one.

377
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,540
I think it's the first one too.

378
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,540
What makes you think that?

379
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,040
Because you took a second sip of the
second tea without being prompted.

380
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,840
I didn't prompt the second one either.

381
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,340
No, no, no.

382
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,340
As in like you didn't prompt the second one,
you just went for a second sip,

383
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,840
but the first one, you made it very clear that
"look, oh, I'm taking a second sip now..."

384
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,340
Oh no!

385
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,540
I just thought it was because it was
the second time, that's why, you know,

386
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,540
for the second one. That's why I thought
it wasn't necessary to prompt.

387
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,340
Oh, she also paused...

388
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,340
She's really trying to convince us.

389
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,340
Yeah, she's trying...

390
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,340
Oh no! You guys have free opinions.

391
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,340
Free opinions.

392
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,040
She also paused slightly longer for
the first one as well.

393
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,540
True, you're right!

394
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,040
I'll take another sip for the first one.

395
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,540
Ah!

396
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,540
Oh!

397
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,040
I heard that! I heard that!

398
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,040
Gulp gulp gulp. It's fine.

399
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,540
She's really trying to convince us
it was not the first one.

400
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,540
Yeah, I don't know.

401
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,540
I think it's the first one.

402
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,540
You think it's the first one?

403
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,540
I don't know. I'm thinking the second one.

404
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,840
Can you drink the second one again?

405
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,340
Ah!

406
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,340
Oh!

407
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,540
That had a little... oh, that had a little
throat gurgle gargle though.

408
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,040
Oh now...

409
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,340
You know when you drink something bitter,
you have like that gag reflex

410
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,340
and your throat goes like all weird?
Her throat went weird for like a split second.

411
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,340
I feel like she's playing mind games.

412
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,040
I feel like it was the first one.

413
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,540
どっちだろうな...
I wonder which one it is...

414
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,540
どっちでしょうね...
Which one could it be?

415
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,540
どっちが苦いのかな...
I wonder which one is bitter...

416
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,340
どっちどっちどっちどっち...
Which one, which one, which one, which one...

417
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,540
Alrighty, which one?

418
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,340
Which? I'm fine with majority...
I'm actually not that sure.

419
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,340
I'm not sure either.

420
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,540
I think it's the... might be the second one. Yeah.

421
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,540
I think it's the second. Yeah.

422
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,340
Final answer?

423
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,540
I think second.

424
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,040
Second.

425
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,040
You guys got it right, the first one!

426
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,540
My sexy princess poses! Oh!

427
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,540
What was sexy princess pose?

428
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,540
I'll do it real quick if you...

429
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,040
I wanted to... oh!

430
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,540
What was your sexy princess pose?

431
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,540
Um, um... um... This one! Sexy princess!

432
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,540
Sexy princess pose!

433
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
What?

434
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,840
What is sexy princess pose?

435
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,248
Whatever pose you do.

436
00:30:01,348 --> 00:30:03,048
Yes, yes, more, yes!

437
00:30:03,248 --> 00:30:04,548
Oh yes! Perfect!

438
00:30:04,648 --> 00:30:06,048
Yes, perfect! Beautiful!

439
00:30:07,048 --> 00:30:09,548
Yes! Oh nice! Oh!

440
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:11,548
Oh my god.

441
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:14,048
I'm such an angel.

442
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:16,548
You guys gotta admit, I still answered your pleas.

443
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,348
Alrighty then. Thank you so...

444
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:19,248
Huh? What? Split?

445
00:30:19,348 --> 00:30:19,948
Can you do a split?

446
00:30:20,048 --> 00:30:21,048
No, no, no.

447
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:22,548
Shut up, no!

448
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:24,048
No! No, don't you...

449
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:26,548
No, no, I'm not. No, shut up.

450
00:30:27,048 --> 00:30:28,548
You guys, we're running out of time, guys.

451
00:30:28,648 --> 00:30:30,948
We're running out of time!

452
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:32,948
It's not because I can't do a split or anything.

453
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:35,548
It's because we actually don't have much... Oh, she's running away.

454
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:38,048
No, we actually don't have much time!

455
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:41,048
Alrighty... Yeah! Thank you guys so much for coming.

456
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,048
That was fun. That was fun.

457
00:30:43,548 --> 00:30:44,948
Oh god, it was... yes!

458
00:30:45,048 --> 00:30:46,948
Yeah! Thank you for having us! Thank you!

459
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:49,548
Thank you! Congratulations!

460
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,048
You're doing an amazing job!

461
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:55,548
Keep it up! Keep it up! Good job, good job!

462
00:30:56,548 --> 00:30:58,048
We're all cheering for you!

463
00:30:58,548 --> 00:30:59,448
Thank you!

464
00:30:59,548 --> 00:31:01,548
Hope doesn't come back up. Bye-bye!

465
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:05,048
IRyS! Bye-bye! IRyS!

466
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:08,048
I don't have to say that. IRyS!

467
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:12,048
Alrighty then. That was fun.

468
00:31:12,548 --> 00:31:15,048
Whoa! But looks like we don't have much time.

469
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:18,048
Our next guest is showing up.

470
00:31:18,548 --> 00:31:20,448
Our next guest from JP.

Our next guest from JP is appearing!

472
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,448

Well, I'm going to go say hi,

473
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:27,048
...and go say hi to her and go change, yeah?

474
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:30,048
Okay, let's go meet her! Be right back!

475
00:31:41,048 --> 00:31:42,448

00:42:43,964 --> 00:42:47,364
私の可愛いマスコットたち。可愛いね！
My cute mascots. So cute!

635
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:48,364
えい！
Hey!

636
00:42:48,364 --> 00:42:51,564
Thank you guys so much for coming.

637
00:42:51,564 --> 00:42:54,664
Ah, is there anything you guys want me...

638
00:42:54,664 --> 00:42:58,264
want me to do with Bloom and Gloom today? The chat?

639
00:42:58,264 --> 00:43:02,364
Chat, I'm watching you. Any sort of pose you want me to do with them?

640
00:43:02,364 --> 00:43:07,064
I'll take maybe one request because we're running out of time.

641
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:10,564
One request if I can see in the comments. Hmm?

642
00:43:10,564 --> 00:43:13,664
"Punch them"? Did I see it?

643
00:43:13,664 --> 00:43:16,564
Did I see a comment to punch them?

644
00:43:16,564 --> 00:43:18,864
Am I going to punch them?

645
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:22,064
You're going to take it, right? You're going to take it, right?

646
00:43:22,064 --> 00:43:24,564
Okay... はぁっ！
Okay... Hah!

647
00:43:24,564 --> 00:43:28,264
Okay... Sorry, sorry, sorry!

648
00:43:28,264 --> 00:43:33,064
This is... this is fan service. There's nothing else I can do.

649
00:43:33,064 --> 00:43:36,064
Okay, you're going to take it good, yeah? You're going to take it. Okay.

650
00:43:36,064 --> 00:43:38,364
はぁっ！
Hah!

651
00:43:38,364 --> 00:43:41,064
Hey! Alrighty.

652
00:43:41,064 --> 00:43:43,564
Now I'm done with you two. I'm done with you two.

653
00:43:43,564 --> 00:43:46,364
That was great. That was... they were great punching bags.

654
00:43:46,364 --> 00:43:49,064
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! They're big hug, big hug, big hug!

655
00:43:49,064 --> 00:43:52,564
Oh, no, no, you're scared. No, no, no. It's okay. Big hug, big hug.

656
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:55,564
I'm sorry! You guys are fine. You guys are...

657
00:43:55,564 --> 00:44:00,064
you guys are very soft. You guys can handle it. We're fine.

658
00:44:00,064 --> 00:44:02,864
Alrighty then! Thank you guys so much for coming, Bloom and Gloom.

659
00:44:02,864 --> 00:44:05,864
I think it's about time you guys go rest, yeah?

660
00:44:05,864 --> 00:44:08,564
Especially now that you've got that that big wound on your face.

661
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:13,564
Bye-bye-RyS! Bye-bye-RyS!

662
00:44:16,064 --> 00:44:19,464
Alrighty then. We're getting to the end of the guest part,

663
00:44:19,464 --> 00:44:22,564
but there's one more guest. One more special guest we have.

664
00:44:22,564 --> 00:44:26,564
Let's welcome our final guest today with a song!

665
00:44:35,364 --> 00:44:42,864
常世の闇に囚われたまま奏でる悲鳴を
With captured screams echoing in the eternal darkness

666
00:44:42,864 --> 00:45:00,064
聞かせて...
Let me hear them...

667
00:45:00,272 --> 00:45:01,472
爪を磨いたのは
I polished my nails...

668
00:45:01,872 --> 00:45:05,572
まだ子どものようなあなたの為に
...for you, who are still like a child.

669
00:45:06,672 --> 00:45:09,172
ああ 試されたいなら
Ah, if you want to be tested,

670
00:45:09,672 --> 00:45:12,872
その愚かな手錠をかけて
put on those foolish handcuffs.

671
00:45:13,872 --> 00:45:17,072
常夜の闇に囚われたまま
Trapped in the darkness of the night,

672
00:45:17,672 --> 00:45:20,172
甘い甘いガムを噛んでて
keep chewing that sweet, sweet gum.

673
00:45:20,872 --> 00:45:23,672
いくつもの幸福を
So many happinesses,

674
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:27,172
さあ 捧げて
come on, offer them up.

675
00:45:28,072 --> 00:45:30,972
さりげない合図に隠れた
Hidden in a casual sign,

676
00:45:31,572 --> 00:45:34,572
答えはすぐにわからせてあげる
I'll make you understand the answer soon.

677
00:45:35,372 --> 00:45:38,272
美少な嘘にまみれた
Smeared with a faint smile and lies,

678
00:45:38,972 --> 00:45:41,872
拒んだままに受け止めてあげる
I'll accept you just as you refuse.

679
00:45:42,572 --> 00:45:45,372
ほら 悲鳴を聴かせて
Look, let me hear your screams.

680
00:46:00,572 --> 00:46:02,872
さあ 指を鳴らしたら
Come, if I snap my fingers,

681
00:46:03,572 --> 00:46:07,172
子猫のような私の為に
for me, who is like a kitten.

682
00:46:08,072 --> 00:46:10,872
ああ 喉が渇いたわ
Ah, I'm thirsty.

683
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:14,672
薄紅の口に指を散らして
Scattering fingers on my pale red mouth.

684
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:18,272
狭い牢屋に閉じ込めたまま
Trapped in a narrow prison,

685
00:46:18,972 --> 00:46:21,872
首輪に繋がれたいの
do you want to be tied to a collar?

686
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:25,472
下らないルールじゃ奪えない
You can't take it away with worthless rules,

687
00:46:25,972 --> 00:46:28,972
自由はすでにこの手の中にある
freedom is already in my hands.

688
00:46:29,672 --> 00:46:32,472
愛情では量れない
It cannot be measured by affection,

689
00:46:33,272 --> 00:46:36,172
弱ったままに選ばせてあげる
I'll let you choose while you're weak.

690
00:46:37,072 --> 00:46:39,972
ほら 心を開いて
Look, open your heart.

691
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:50,672
分からないフリをして
Pretending not to know,

692
00:46:51,372 --> 00:46:54,172
惚けてるの？
are you being absent-minded?

693
00:46:55,172 --> 00:46:57,972
もっと熱い暗闇を見せて
Show me a hotter darkness.

694
00:46:58,772 --> 00:47:00,872
ねえ
Hey...

695
00:47:03,272 --> 00:47:06,172
さりげない合図に隠れた
Hidden in a casual sign,

696
00:47:06,972 --> 00:47:09,872
答えはすぐにわからせてあげる
I'll make you understand the answer soon.

697
00:47:10,572 --> 00:47:13,672
美少な嘘にまみれた
Smeared with a faint smile and lies,

698
00:47:14,372 --> 00:47:17,372
拒んだままに受け止めてあげる
I'll accept you just as you refuse.

699
00:47:18,072 --> 00:47:22,172
常夜の闇に誘うこの名を
This name that invites into the darkness of night,

700
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:25,172
分からせてあげる
I'll make you understand.

701
00:47:25,872 --> 00:47:28,972
ほら 悲鳴を聴かせてよ
Look, let me hear your screams.

702
00:47:30,872 --> 00:47:33,472
夢見ないで
Don't dream.

703
00:47:34,972 --> 00:47:38,272
ほら 聴かせて
Look, let me hear.

704
00:47:51,772 --> 00:47:53,972
はい、今はトワ先輩の FACT でした！
Yes, that was Towa-senpai's "FACT"!

705
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:58,172
そして、本日最後のゲストのトワ先輩です！
And here is the final guest for today,

706
00:47:58,172 --> 00:47:59,972
ご登場！
Towa-senpai! Welcome!

707
00:48:00,072 --> 00:48:03,472
イェーイ！ホロライブ 4 期生の常闇トワ様です！
Yay! I'm Tokoyami Towa-sama from Hololive 4th Gen!

708
00:48:03,572 --> 00:48:08,072
ヤッホー！ということで IRyS、3D 改めておめでとう！
Yahoo! So IRyS, congrats again on your 3D!

709
00:48:08,572 --> 00:48:11,772
ありがとう！今日来てくれておつりりありがとう！
Thank you! Thanks for coming today, Otsu-Ri-Ri!

710
00:48:11,872 --> 00:48:13,172
呼んでくれて嬉しかった！
I was happy you invited me!

711
00:48:13,272 --> 00:48:15,872
しかもトワの曲の FACT 歌ってくれて嬉しかったよ！
And I was happy you sang Towa's song "FACT"!

712
00:48:15,972 --> 00:48:18,372
絶対歌いたかった、これマジでかっこいい。
I definitely wanted to sing it, it's really cool.

713
00:48:18,472 --> 00:48:21,772
え、しかもさ、デビューの時も Palette 歌ってくれたもんね、動画で。
And you also sang "Palette" when you debuted, in a video.

714
00:48:21,872 --> 00:48:25,072
そう、2 回目！もうなんと 2 回目！
Yes, the second time! Already the second time!

715
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:30,472
嬉しい！じゃあということでトワも IRyS の曲をカバーしないとね。
I'm happy! So Towa should cover IRyS's song too.

716
00:48:31,072 --> 00:48:34,072
いや、そのプレッシャー、プレッシャーをかけて！
No, that pressure, put pressure on me!

717
00:48:34,572 --> 00:48:35,972
え、っていうかしていいの？
Wait, is it okay if I do?

718
00:48:36,072 --> 00:48:38,972
あ、もちろん！ぜひぜひ聞きたい、聞きたいよ！
Ah, of course! I definitely want to hear it!

719
00:48:39,072 --> 00:48:42,172
ということでいつかちょっと歌枠で披露しちゃおうかななんて思います。
So I'm thinking of performing it in a singing stream someday.

720
00:48:42,572 --> 00:48:44,272
わーい！わーい！
Yay! Yay!

721
00:48:44,872 --> 00:48:46,372
はい、ということで...
Yes, so...

722
00:48:46,472 --> 00:48:50,472
実はこの二人、ちょっとどうですか？配信で二人きりみたいなのは。
Actually, these two... how is it? Being just the two of us on stream.

723
00:48:50,572 --> 00:48:51,972
あんまりないよね。
Not much, right.

724
00:48:52,072 --> 00:48:53,372
っていうかむしろほぼない。
Or rather, almost none.

725
00:48:53,672 --> 00:48:57,872
そう、そうだよね。なんか大人数ではまああるけど。
Yeah, that's right. Like, in a large group there is, but...

726
00:48:57,972 --> 00:48:59,972
もう二人ではちょっとあんまりないね。
But just the two of us, not really.

727
00:49:00,072 --> 00:49:02,272
でも、実は結構遊んでたりしてね。
But, actually, we hang out quite a bit.

728
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:05,072
そうなの！そうなの、みんな、実はね。
That's right! That's right, everyone, actually.

729
00:49:05,172 --> 00:49:09,072
そう、アフタヌーンティーに、カリもいたけど、カリと行ったりとか。
Yeah, we went to afternoon tea, Calli was there too, but with Calli...

730
00:49:09,172 --> 00:49:10,472
あれめっちゃ美味しかった！
That was so delicious!

731
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:13,672
で、二人だけで夢の国行ったりとか。
And we went to the "Dreamland" just the two of us.

732
00:49:14,072 --> 00:49:16,972
夢の国マジで感動したんだけど。あのショーとか。
Dreamland really moved me. That show and all.

733
00:49:17,072 --> 00:49:20,972
もうショーを二人で見て、もう色々、いやーこれはいいねって。
We watched the show together and were like, "Wow, this is great."

734
00:49:21,072 --> 00:49:23,472
トワたちもこんな感じでやりたいねなんて言って。
Towa and I said we wanted to do something like that.

735
00:49:23,572 --> 00:49:25,472
あとスプラッシュでびしょ濡れ。
And getting soaked at Splash Mountain.

736
00:49:25,572 --> 00:49:27,672
そう、びしょ濡れになったわ！マジで！
Yes, we got soaked! Seriously!

737
00:49:28,072 --> 00:49:30,872
びしょ濡れだったね、あれマジ楽しかった！
We were soaked, that was seriously fun!

738
00:49:30,972 --> 00:49:37,472
楽しかったね。そう、意外とね、裏じゃ、裏というかまあ配信外でちょっと遊んだりしてたんですよ。
It was fun. Yeah, unexpectedly, outside of streaming, we've been hanging out.

739
00:49:37,572 --> 00:49:43,872
そう、だからこういう大きな場所でなんかトワ先輩と話すのはなんか、つい素、素が出ちゃう感じがして。
So, talking with Towa-senpai in a big place like this makes my true self come out.

740
00:49:43,972 --> 00:49:46,472
いやー、いいよ、その素で嬉しいよ。
Well, that's fine, I'm happy you're being yourself.

741
00:49:46,572 --> 00:49:49,672
しかもちょっと 3D で並ぶのも若干恥ずかしいところもあるわ。
And standing together in 3D is also a bit embarrassing.

742
00:49:50,072 --> 00:49:52,972
何言ってんすか！トワ先輩可愛いじゃないですか！
What are you saying! Towa-senpai, you're cute!

743
00:49:53,072 --> 00:49:55,872
ありがとう。スタイルがいい IRyS さん、ありがとうございます。
Thank you. Miss IRyS with the good figure, thank you very much.

744
00:49:55,972 --> 00:49:58,172
ありがとう。この身長差が目立ちますけど。
Thank you. This height difference stands out though.

745
00:49:58,272 --> 00:49:59,972
身長差可愛いよ！
The height difference is cute!

746
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,380
むしろそれがいい。
Actually, I like it that way.

747
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,480
ほんとに？むしろそれがいい？
Really? You like it that way?

748
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,480
アイリスの... いいな、からだ。
IRyS's... I like it, your body.

749
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:11,780
あ、そう。これからいっぱい牛乳飲めばいけんじゃない？
Oh, really? If I drink lots of milk from now on, I'll be fine, right?

750
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,580
牛乳飲めば、イエーイ！
Drink milk! Yay!

751
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,480
まあということでね、このあとも歌うんだよね？
Well then, we're going to sing another one after this, right?

752
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,080
うん、バリバリ歌います。
Yep, I'm gonna sing my heart out.

753
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,180
今日は誘ってくれてありがとう、本当に嬉しかった。
Thanks for inviting me today, I was really happy.

754
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,580
こちらこそありがとう、本当に。
The pleasure's mine, thank you, really.

755
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:29,680
めちゃくちゃ一緒に歌えてマジで。今後もトワ先輩みたいな歌歌えるように頑張るわ。
I'm so glad we could sing together. I'll do my best to sing like you, Towa-senpai.

756
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,380
えー、嬉しい、ありがとう。じゃあこの後の歌も頑張って。
Aw, that makes me happy, thanks. Good luck with the next song too.

757
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,080
はい！呼んでくれてありがとう！
Yes! Thanks for having me today!

758
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,280
ありがとう、バイバイ！またね！頑張れー！
Thank you, bye-bye! See ya! Good luck!

759
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:57,080
ばかみたい
Lyrics: 堀井亮佑 Composition: 福山光晴
Baka Mitai
Lyrics: Ryosuke Horii Composition: Mitsuharu Fukuyama

760
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,580
ばかみたい 子供なのね
I'm such a fool, just like a child

761
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:15,080
夢を追って 傷ついて
Chasing dreams and getting hurt

762
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:21,380
嘘が下手なくせに
Even though I'm a bad liar

763
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:28,180
笑えない笑顔みせた
I showed a smile that couldn't even laugh

764
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:34,980
I love youも ろくに言わない
I can't even say "I love you" properly

765
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:42,180
口下手で ほんまに不器用
So poor with words, truly clumsy

766
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:48,380
なのに なのにどうして
And yet, and yet, why

767
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:53,980
サヨナラは言えたの
Was I able to say goodbye?

768
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:00,680
だめだね だめよ だめなのよ
It's no good, no good, it's just no good

769
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:07,480
あんたが好きで 好きすぎて
I love you, I love you too much

770
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:14,280
どれだけ 強いお酒でも
No matter how strong the alcohol is

771
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:20,980
歪まない思い出が
Memories that won't blur

772
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:24,480
ばかみたい
What a fool

773
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:42,880
ばかみたい 本当バカね
What a fool, a real fool

774
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:49,680
あんた信じる ばかりで
Only ever believing in you

775
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:56,280
強い女のふり
Pretending to be a strong woman

776
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:02,880
切なさの夜風浴びる
Bathing in the night breeze of sadness

777
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:09,380
一人になって 3年が過ぎ
Three years have passed since I became alone

778
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:15,880
街並みさえも 変わりました
Even the cityscape has changed

779
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:22,480
なのに なのにどうして
And yet, and yet, why

780
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:28,180
未練だけ置き去り
Were only the lingering regrets left behind?

781
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:34,980
ほんまに ろくな男やない
Truly, you're a no-good man

782
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:41,080
揃いの指輪 はずします
I'll take off our matching rings

783
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:47,480
ざまあみろ せいせいするわ
Serve you right, I feel refreshed

784
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:55,880
いい加減 待ってても ばかみたい
Waiting forever is just foolish

785
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:23,280
だめだね だめよ だめなのよ
It's no good, no good, it's just no good

786
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:30,080
あんたが好きで 好きすぎて
I love you, I love you too much

787
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:36,680
どれだけ 強いお酒でも
No matter how strong the alcohol is

788
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:43,080
歪まない思い出が
Memories that won't blur

789
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,480

What a fool

790
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:52,480
ほんまに ろくな男やない
Truly, you're a no-good man

791

揃いの指輪 はずします
I'll take off our matching rings

792
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,280
ざまあみろ せいせいするわ
Serve you right, I feel refreshed

793
00:55:01,088 --> 00:55:05,588
ざまあみろ、せいせいするわ
Serves you right, what a relief.

794
00:55:06,088 --> 00:55:10,088
なんなのよ、この涙
What are these tears?

795
00:55:10,288 --> 00:55:14,088
馬鹿みたい
I've been a fool.

796
00:55:43,288 --> 00:55:44,288
Ha...

797
00:55:44,388 --> 00:55:47,888
And that was Baka Mitai!

798
00:55:48,088 --> 00:55:51,388
You guys are probably wondering why Baka Mitai.

799
00:55:51,588 --> 00:55:54,588
Because I wanted to sing it, that's why!

800
00:55:54,688 --> 00:55:56,088
I've always wanted to sing it.

801
00:55:56,288 --> 00:55:57,288
Ah, that was good stuff.

802
00:55:57,388 --> 00:56:00,088
Alrighty then, but we're getting close to the ending, yes?

803
00:56:01,588 --> 00:56:04,088
So I think it's about time we move.

804
00:56:04,188 --> 00:56:07,088
I think it's really nice weather, nice nighttime.

805
00:56:07,188 --> 00:56:10,588
I think it's now time for a nice night drive...

806
00:56:10,688 --> 00:56:14,088
...toward the arena, In Arena!

807
00:56:14,188 --> 00:56:15,588
Let's go by car!

808
00:56:15,688 --> 00:56:18,588
So follow me! Follow me! Woo!

809
00:56:30,288 --> 00:56:31,588
Hey guys, come here, come here.

810
00:56:34,088 --> 00:56:38,088
Check out my new car!

811
00:56:39,088 --> 00:56:40,588
Obviously, I'll drive.

812
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:43,588
You? You sit in the passenger seat.

813
00:56:43,688 --> 00:56:46,588
You don't have a problem with that, right? Yeah, yeah.

814
00:56:47,088 --> 00:56:48,588
Go sit over there.

815
00:56:49,088 --> 00:56:52,088
So excited for this!

816
00:56:56,588 --> 00:56:57,588
Shock!

817
00:56:58,288 --> 00:56:59,288
Shock!

818
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:03,088
Crazy for love!

819
00:57:07,588 --> 00:57:14,088
Crazy for love, crazy for love, crazy for love, crazy for love...

820
00:57:14,188 --> 00:57:15,588
Shock!

821
00:57:15,688 --> 00:57:17,088
Shock!

822
00:57:17,188 --> 00:57:19,588
Crazy for love...

823
00:57:32,088 --> 00:57:34,588
Got to be the first one, got to be the last one

824
00:57:34,688 --> 00:57:37,588
You never get no peace of mind

825
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:40,588
Never show emotions, all communication's over

826
00:57:40,688 --> 00:57:43,588
You got no feeling

827
00:57:43,688 --> 00:57:46,588
Stop it now, guess you wonder why

828
00:57:46,688 --> 00:57:49,588
You just sold out the dream inside

829
00:57:49,688 --> 00:57:52,588
Up and down, baby for your lovin'

830
00:57:52,688 --> 00:57:55,588
Baby we can fly up to the sky

831
00:57:55,688 --> 00:57:58,588
Every day, every night, crazy for love

832
00:57:58,688 --> 00:58:01,588
Into the depth of desire

833
00:58:01,688 --> 00:58:04,588
Every time, everywhere, crazy for love

834
00:58:04,688 --> 00:58:07,588
And now my spirit's on fire

835
00:58:07,688 --> 00:58:10,588
Every day, every night, crazy for love

836
00:58:10,688 --> 00:58:13,588
Into the depth of desire

837
00:58:13,688 --> 00:58:16,588
Every time, everywhere, crazy for love

838
00:58:16,688 --> 00:58:19,588
And now my spirit's on fire

839
00:58:19,688 --> 00:58:21,588
Crazy for love...

840
00:58:22,088 --> 00:58:22,588
Shock!

841
00:58:35,088 --> 00:58:37,588
When you get that feeling, when you find some lovin'

842
00:58:37,688 --> 00:58:40,588
You've got to run away from here

843
00:58:40,688 --> 00:58:43,588
Show me your emotion, baby make me feel so natural

844
00:58:43,688 --> 00:58:46,588
It's the real thing

845
00:58:46,688 --> 00:58:49,588
Stop it now, guess you wonder why

846
00:58:49,688 --> 00:58:52,588
You just sold out the dream inside

847
00:58:52,688 --> 00:58:55,588
Up and down, baby for your lovin'

00:58:55,688 --> 00:58:58,588

Into the depth of desire

855
00:59:16,688 --> 00:59:19,588
Every time, everywhere, crazy for love

856
00:59:19,688 --> 00:59:22,588
And now my spirit's on fire

857
00:59:22,688 --> 00:59:24,588
Crazy for love...

858
00:59:25,088 --> 00:59:25,888
Shock!

859
00:59:50,088 --> 00:59:52,588
When you get that feeling, when you find some lovin'

860
00:59:52,688 --> 00:59:55,588
You've got to run away from here

861
00:59:55,688 --> 00:59:58,588
Show me your emotion, baby make me feel so natural

862
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,368
Baby make me feel so natural

863
01:00:01,368 --> 01:00:02,139
It's the real thing

864
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:04,974
Stop it now, guess you wonder why

865
01:00:04,974 --> 01:00:08,157
You just sold out the dream inside

866
01:00:08,157 --> 01:00:11,292
Up and down, baby for your lovin'

867
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:13,978
Baby we can fly up to the sky

868
01:00:13,978 --> 01:00:16,924
Every day, every night, crazy for love

869
01:00:16,924 --> 01:00:19,838

Shock!

878
01:01:03,538 --> 01:01:04,634
Got no feeling

879
01:01:04,634 --> 01:01:07,822
Stop it now, guess you wonder why

880
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:14,345
Up and down, baby for your lovin'

881
01:01:16,614 --> 01:01:19,744
Every day, every night, crazy for love

882
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:25,961
Every time, everywhere, crazy for love

883
01:01:29,327 --> 01:01:31,852
Every day, every night, crazy for love

884
01:01:31,852 --> 01:01:34,813
Into the depth of desire

885
01:01:34,813 --> 01:01:37,808
Every time, everywhere, crazy for love

886
01:01:37,808 --> 01:01:40,931
And now my spirit's on fire

887
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:43,304
Crazy for love

888
01:01:43,304 --> 01:01:44,296
Shock!

889
01:01:54,096 --> 01:01:55,417
Phew!

890
01:01:55,417 --> 01:01:57,532
How was that drive?

891
01:01:57,532 --> 01:02:01,424
I had a wonderful time with you guys, and we are here in one piece.

892
01:02:01,424 --> 01:02:04,044
One piece, no harm whatsoever...

893
01:02:04,044 --> 01:02:07,190
...we did not crash into anything.

894
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:10,615
Very safe, very fast drive.

895
01:02:10,615 --> 01:02:15,581
And here we are at the EN Arena! Woo!

896
01:02:15,581 --> 01:02:17,433
That was great.

897
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:19,885
And I sang so much, I'm getting a little tired.

898
01:02:19,885 --> 01:02:22,277
I kind of think I need a drink.

899
01:02:22,277 --> 01:02:27,455
Let me go get that drink.

900
01:02:27,455 --> 01:02:29,079
Ey!

901
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:33,531
And what else would I drink than this, the Hope Soda!

902
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:38,315
Ah!

903
01:02:38,315 --> 01:02:40,503
Ah, that's good stuff.

904
01:02:40,503 --> 01:02:42,598
Isn't it cute? I love the can, it's so cute.

905
01:02:42,598 --> 01:02:45,849
Ah, this is like the best soda on earth.

906
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:48,922
And maybe a lot of you guys haven't tried it...

907
01:02:48,922 --> 01:02:51,368
...maybe a lot of you guys don't have it.

908
01:02:51,368 --> 01:02:52,578
It's okay...

909
01:02:52,578 --> 01:02:56,979
...because the merch today will be able to make up for it somewhat.

910
01:02:56,979 --> 01:03:00,096
Because even if you don't have your own Hope Soda...

911
01:03:00,096 --> 01:03:01,223
Bam!

912
01:03:01,223 --> 01:03:02,242
HOPE Soda Can SleeveRyS (Can Sleeve)

913
01:03:02,242 --> 01:03:05,026
Bam! You can use this Hope Soda can sleeveRyS...

914
01:03:05,026 --> 01:03:08,925
...to turn your run-of-the-mill old soda, whatever it is, into Hope Soda.

915
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:17,243
At least feel like you're drinking Hope Soda. Let's go! Isn't it cute?

916
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:22,780
The nice refreshing red-pink and the cool black strap. Yes!

917
01:03:23,609 --> 01:03:27,671
And it's getting very hot, so I think it's a nice time to, you know...

918
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:29,959
...have a nice cold drink, yes.

919
01:03:29,959 --> 01:03:32,500
Keep your drink chilled...

920
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,436
...and your hands drip-free. Yay!

921
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:38,484
So, buy-RyS the sleeve-RyS!

922
01:03:38,484 --> 01:03:41,267
Don't... not "bye-RyS", I mean B-U-Y-RyS.

923
01:03:41,267 --> 01:03:44,321
Buy-RyS the sleeve, let's go!

924
01:03:48,096 --> 01:03:51,200
Alrighty then.

925
01:03:54,036 --> 01:03:58,310
It's really been reaching towards the very, very end.

926
01:03:58,310 --> 01:04:02,142
It was a long journey, it's been what, two years?

927
01:04:02,142 --> 01:04:06,601
Over two years since debut, and we're finally here with my 3D showcase.

928
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:08,622
I really wanted to do this.

929
01:04:08,622 --> 01:04:13,406
Becoming 3D was one of my big reasons for wanting to join Hololive.

930
01:04:13,406 --> 01:04:18,695
And actually being able to stand here doing this 3D...

931
01:04:18,695 --> 01:04:23,024
...it's all thanks to you guys and your support. Thank you so, so much.

932
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,163
And yes, it's been a long two years and we're here...

933
01:04:28,163 --> 01:04:30,462
...but it's the start of a new page.

934
01:04:30,462 --> 01:04:34,676
And here's to many more years to come. Yay!

935
01:04:37,504 --> 01:04:38,931
Alrighty then.

936
01:04:38,931 --> 01:04:42,462
Well, I think it's time for the final song.

937
01:04:43,844 --> 01:04:46,911
最後の1曲になるのかな？
I wonder if it'll be the last song?

938
01:04:49,327 --> 01:04:53,944
怪しいね、さ、さ、最後の1曲になるかな、どうだろう？
Suspicious, isn't it? I wonder if it will be the final song, who knows?

939
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:58,873
Well, who knows, maybe you guys might want an encore, I don't know...

940
01:04:58,873 --> 01:05:00,096
...or maybe you guys want me to just hurry up and get out.

941
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:01,404
I'm not done with, I don't know, but...

942
01:05:01,404 --> 01:05:07,004
please listen to my final song,
my original song, BERSERKER.

943
01:05:23,104 --> 01:05:27,104
BERSERKER

944
01:05:23,104 --> 01:05:27,104
Lyrics: Spirit Garden Composition: 都丸喗太(Elements Garden)
Lyrics: Spirit Garden Composition: Kyota Tomaru (Elements Garden)

945
01:05:29,104 --> 01:05:32,504
蔓延る不協和音 混沌のShow
The spreading dissonance, a show of chaos.

946
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:38,304
耳を塞いでも 搾取された日常
Even if I plug my ears, my daily life is exploited.

947
01:05:38,604 --> 01:05:43,104
立ち上がれ 理不尽に喘いでも
Stand up, even if you're panting under the weight of injustice.

948
01:05:43,404 --> 01:05:48,104
何人たりとも 此処は 奪わせないよ
I won't let anyone take this place away from me.

949
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:52,804
私が私であることが
That I am who I am...

950
01:05:53,104 --> 01:05:57,504
私自身の正義だから
Is my own justice.

951
01:05:57,804 --> 01:06:02,204
I know どんな結末になっても
I know no matter what the ending is.

952
01:06:02,504 --> 01:06:08,604
後悔は1ミリもない
I don't have even a millimeter of regret.

953
01:06:09,204 --> 01:06:10,104
Burn up

954
01:06:10,404 --> 01:06:14,704
怒髪天 衝いて燃え盛れ 想いを懸けて Everything
Let your boiling anger reach the sky and burn brightly, stake your feelings on everything.

955
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:16,904
I'm a Berserker

956
01:06:17,004 --> 01:06:19,504
塵と化せ 有象無象
Turn into dust, you rabble.

957
01:06:19,804 --> 01:06:24,104
私の世界は 私のモノ 捧げるのは 希望
My world is mine, what I offer is hope.

958
01:06:25,104 --> 01:06:26,604
Absolutely

959
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:29,604
高らかに
Loudly and clearly.

960
01:06:30,104 --> 01:06:31,604
Absolutely

961
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:34,304
目覚めよ 今 Wake up
Awaken now, wake up.

962
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:42,404
並べ立てられた ご都合主義
Opportunism lined up one after another.

963
01:06:42,704 --> 01:06:48,404
噛みつき剥ぎ取り 弱者は強者のPrey
Biting and tearing away, the weak are the prey of the strong.

964
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:53,104
立ち上がれ 不条理に泣いても
Stand up, even if you cry at the absurdity.

965
01:06:53,404 --> 01:06:58,304
何人たりとも 此処は 汚させないよ
I won't let anyone defile this place.

966
01:06:58,604 --> 01:07:02,904
私は私の言霊で
I, with my own spirit of words...

967
01:07:03,204 --> 01:07:07,604
私自身と歩いてゆく
Will walk on with myself.

968
01:07:07,904 --> 01:07:12,404
I know どんなに嗤われたって
I know no matter how much I'm laughed at.

969
01:07:12,704 --> 01:07:18,604
恥ずべきことはない
There is nothing to be ashamed of.

970
01:07:19,204 --> 01:07:20,104
Don't stop

971
01:07:20,404 --> 01:07:24,704
進み続け 何度も生まれ変わりながら Fearless
Keep moving forward, being reborn over and over again, fearless.

972
01:07:25,404 --> 01:07:26,904
I'm a Berserker

973
01:07:27,004 --> 01:07:29,504
蹴散らして 有象無象
Scatter the rabble.

974
01:07:29,804 --> 01:07:34,104
私の世界は 私のモノ 揺るがない真実を
My world is mine, the unwavering truth...

975
01:07:35,104 --> 01:07:36,604
Absolutely

976
01:07:36,904 --> 01:07:39,604
燦々と
Brilliantly.

977
01:07:40,104 --> 01:07:41,604
Absolutely

978
01:07:41,904 --> 01:07:44,304
目覚めよ 今 Wake up
Awaken now, wake up.

979
01:08:02,204 --> 01:08:03,104
Burn up

980
01:08:03,404 --> 01:08:07,704
怒髪天 衝いて燃え盛れ 想いを懸けて Everything
Let your boiling anger reach the sky and burn brightly, stake your feelings on everything.

981
01:08:08,404 --> 01:08:09,904
I'm a Berserker

982
01:08:10,004 --> 01:08:12,504
塵と化せ 有象無象
Turn into dust, you rabble.

983
01:08:12,804 --> 01:08:17,104
私の世界は 私のモノ 捧げるのは 希望
My world is mine, what I offer is hope.

984
01:08:18,104 --> 01:08:19,604
Absolutely

985
01:08:19,904 --> 01:08:22,604
高らかに
Loudly and clearly.

986
01:08:23,104 --> 01:08:24,604
Absolutely

987
01:08:24,904 --> 01:08:27,304
目覚めよ 今 Wake up
Awaken now, wake up.

988
01:08:41,604 --> 01:08:51,104
アンコール！ アンコール！
Encore! Encore!

989
01:08:51,604 --> 01:08:57,704
え〜、そこまでみんな言うなら、しゃーないなー！
Eh? Since everyone's saying it that much, I guess I have no choice!

990
01:08:58,104 --> 01:08:59,904
最後の1曲になります。
This will be the very last song.

991
01:09:00,104 --> 01:09:03,504
Please listen to my last song for today, One Last Kiss.

992
01:09:13,104 --> 01:09:16,104
One Last Kiss

993
01:09:13,104 --> 01:09:16,104
Lyrics: Hikaru Utada

994
01:09:32,504 --> 01:09:36,604
初めてのルーブルは なんてことはなかったわ
My first time at the Louvre was nothing special.

995
01:09:36,804 --> 01:09:40,604
私だけのモナリザ もうとっくに出会ってたから
Because I'd already met my own Mona Lisa a long time ago.

996
01:09:41,004 --> 01:09:45,404
初めてあなたを見た あの日動き出した歯車
The gears that started moving the day I first saw you...

997
01:09:45,604 --> 01:09:49,904
止められない喪失の予感
The unstoppable premonition of loss.

998
01:09:50,104 --> 01:09:54,504
もういっぱいあるけど
There's already so much, but...

999
01:09:54,604 --> 01:09:59,604
もう一つ増やしましょう
Let's add one more.

1000
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:02,412
Can you give me one last kiss?

1001
01:10:03,512 --> 01:10:06,412
忘れたくないこと
Things I don't want to forget

1002
01:10:06,612 --> 01:10:20,812
Oh oh oh oh...

1003
01:10:21,112 --> 01:10:24,112
I love you more than you'll ever know

1004
01:10:32,512 --> 01:10:34,512
写真は苦手なんだ
I'm not good at photos

1005
01:10:34,512 --> 01:10:36,512
でもそんなものはいらないわ
But I don't need anything like that

1006
01:10:36,512 --> 01:10:38,512
あなたが焼き付いたまま
While you're burned into

1007
01:10:38,512 --> 01:10:40,912
私の心のプロジェクター
The projector of my heart

1008
01:10:40,912 --> 01:10:42,912
寂しくないふりしてた
I pretended not to be lonely

1009
01:10:42,912 --> 01:10:44,912
まあ、そんなのお互い様か
Well, I guess we're in the same boat

1010
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:46,912
誰かを求めることは
Seeking someone

1011
01:10:46,912 --> 01:10:49,312
即ち傷つくことだった
Means getting hurt in the process

1012
01:10:49,312 --> 01:10:54,112
Oh, can you give me one last kiss?

1013
01:10:54,512 --> 01:10:58,612
燃えるようなキスをしよう
Let's share a kiss as hot as fire

1014
01:11:00,112 --> 01:11:03,112
忘れたくても
Even if I want to forget

1015
01:11:03,312 --> 01:11:07,112
忘れられないほど
I can't forget you no matter what

1016
01:11:07,112 --> 01:11:12,912
Oh oh oh oh...

1017
01:11:13,112 --> 01:11:16,112
I love you more than you'll ever know

1018
01:11:16,112 --> 01:11:21,112
Oh oh oh oh...

1019
01:11:21,612 --> 01:11:24,612
I love you more than you'll ever know

1020
01:11:41,112 --> 01:11:46,612
もう分かっているよ
I already know

1021
01:11:46,612 --> 01:11:51,112
この世の終わりでも
Even at the end of the world

1022
01:11:51,112 --> 01:11:57,112
年をとっても
Even if I grow old

1023
01:11:57,112 --> 01:12:32,112
忘れられない人
Someone I'll never forget

1024
01:12:32,512 --> 01:12:46,112
忘れられない
I'll never forget

1025
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:50,112
I love you more than you'll ever know

1026
01:12:58,112 --> 01:13:03,112
吹いていった風の後を
Tracing the path of the wind

1027
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:08,112
追いかけた 眩しい午後
I chased it on a dazzling afternoon

1028
01:13:19,512 --> 01:13:22,512
Thank you so much for coming everyone!

1029
01:13:22,512 --> 01:13:25,112
今日みんな来てくれてありがとう！
Thank you all for coming today!

1030
01:13:25,312 --> 01:13:26,612
ByeRyS!

1031
01:13:26,812 --> 01:13:29,512
Bye-ByeRyS!
