00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,400
世界の始まりの日
On the day the world began

4
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,800
生命の樹の下で
Beneath the tree of life

5
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,100
くじらたちの声の
The voices of whales

6
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,500
遠い残響 二人で聞いた
Distant echoes we heard together

7
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,900
失くしたものすべて
Everything we've lost

8
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,100
愛したものすべて
Everything we've loved

9
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,400
この手に抱きしめて
I'll hold them close in these arms

10
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,400
現在は何処を 彷徨い行くの
Where am I wandering now?

11
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,400
答えの潜む 琥珀の太陽
The amber sun where answers hide

12
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,000
出会わなければ
If we had never met

13
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,300
殺戮の天使でいられた
I could have remained an angel of slaughter

14
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,400
不死なる瞬き持つ魂
A soul with an immortal blink

15
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,600
傷つかないで 僕の羽根
Don't be hurt, my wings

16
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:47,800
この気持ち知るため 生まれてきた
I was born to know this feeling

17
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,000
一万年と二千年前から
From twelve thousand years ago

18
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,200
愛してる
I love you

19
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,500
八千年過ぎた頃から
From the time eight thousand years passed

20
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,200
もっと恋しくなった
I started longing for you even more

21
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,900
一億と二千年あとも
Even one hundred million and two thousand years later

22
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,100
愛してる
I love you

23
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,300
君を知ったその日から
From the day I first knew you

24
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,600
僕の地獄に音楽は絶えない
Music has never ceased in my hell

25
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,500
世界が終わる前に
Before the world ends

26
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,800
生命が終わる前に
Before life ends

27
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,000
眠る嘆きほどいて
Unraveling the sleeping grief

28
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,300
君の香り 抱きしめたいよ
I want to embrace your scent

29
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,200
耳すませた海神の記憶
Memory of the sea god I listened closely to

30
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,300
失意にのまれ
Swallowed by despair

31
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,500
立ち尽くす麗しき月
The beautiful moon standing still

32
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
よみがえれ 永遠に涸れぬ光
Arise, the light that never withers forever

33
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:03,108
よみがえれ 永遠に 涸れぬ光
Awaken, oh eternal and unwithering light

34
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:06,128
汚されないで 君の夢
Don't let your dreams be defiled

35
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:12,728
祈り宿しながら 生まれてきた
I was born while harboring a prayer

36
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:20,128
一万年と二千年前から 愛してる
I've loved you for twelve thousand years

37
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:26,328
八千年過ぎた頃から もっと恋しくなった

一億と二千年あとも 愛してる
I'll love you even one hundred million and two thousand years from now

39
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:40,088
君を知ったその日から 僕の地獄に音楽は絶えない
Since the day I met you, music has never ceased in my hell

40
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,728
君が繰り返し 大人になって
You repeatedly grow into an adult

41
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:52,488
何度も 何度も 遠くへ行って
And go far away again and again

42
00:05:52,808 --> 00:05:55,448
見守る僕が眠れない
Watching over you, I cannot sleep

43
00:05:55,768 --> 00:05:59,408
僕がくしゃくしゃになったとしても
Even if I end up worn and tattered

44
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:13,688
君の名を歌うために
In order to sing your name

45
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:20,128
一万年と二千年前から 愛してる
I've loved you for twelve thousand years

46
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:26,328
八千年過ぎた頃から もっと恋しくなった
I've loved you more since eight thousand years passed

47
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:32,608
一億と二千年あとも 愛してる
I'll love you even one hundred million and two thousand years from now

48
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:39,128
君を知ったその日から
Since the day I met you

49
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:46,128
一万年と二千年前から 愛してる
I've loved you for twelve thousand years

50
00:06:46,648 --> 00:06:52,328
八千年過ぎた頃から もっと恋しくなった
I've loved you more since eight thousand years passed

51
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:58,608
一億と二千年たっても 愛してる
I'll love you even after one hundred million and two thousand years

52
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:06,088
君を知ったその日から 僕の地獄に音楽は絶えない
Since the day I met you, music has never ceased in my hell

53
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:36,688
幸せを願っただけで
I only wished for happiness

54
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:41,808
私の目に見えたのは
But what my eyes saw was...

55
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:45,328
誰かの愛が違う
Someone's love is different

56
00:07:45,888 --> 00:07:51,328
誰かの愛を殺す世界で
In a world where someone's love is killed

57
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:57,368
この手に握った黒金
This black iron I hold in my hand

58
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:03,208
あとどれだけ冷静でいられるのだろう
How much longer can I remain calm?

59
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:08,408
それとも私はもう
Or am I already...

60
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,848
狂ってるの？
Going mad?

61
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:14,128
わからない
I don't know

62
00:08:14,488 --> 00:08:18,408
どんなに未来を描いて
No matter how I picture the future

63
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:22,368
望もうがいても届かない
No matter how I hope and struggle, I can't reach it

64
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:25,328
何が正しいだと言うの？
What is it you call "correct"?

65
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:28,648
誰が心まで裁くの？
Who will judge even the heart?

66
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:29,928
ねえ
Hey

67
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:33,088
命が消える 優しさのせいで
Lives vanish because of kindness

68
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:37,088
弱さが罪と言うなら答えて
If weakness is a sin, then answer me

69
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:42,088
私は誰を犠牲に生きて
Whom am I living by sacrificing?

70
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:47,368
銃口を向ける 間違わないように
I aim my gun so that I don't make a mistake

71
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:04,368
唇を噛む 滲んだ血の味は
The taste of blood from biting my lip

72
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:10,208
誰も同じ あなたと奥底知ってた
Everyone's the same, I knew that deep down with you

73
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:20,368
終わりのない 悲しみの行く先は
Where does this endless sorrow lead?

74
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:26,368
どんなに怒りを飲み込み
No matter how much I swallow my anger

75
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:31,968
消してもその火は燃え上がり
Even if I put it out, the fire flares up

76
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:36,888
見据えた眼差しの先は
What lies ahead of my fixed gaze

77
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:41,088
もう決してぶれたりしない
Will never waver again

78
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:44,128
響く乾いた銃声
A dry gunshot echoes

79
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:48,648
遠くで聞こえる 罵声と絶叫
Abuse and screams heard in the distance

80
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,128
正義を問いかける
Questioning justice

81
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:56,128
私と彼ら どちらが死ねばいい
Me or them, who should die?

82
00:09:56,408 --> 00:09:59,888
守れるものは一つしかないから
Because there's only one thing I can protect

83
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:09,966
他人の痛みを描い 心と寄り添う
Imaging others' pain and drawing close to their hearts

84
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:15,866
人はこんなにも 美しいのに
Even though people are so beautiful...

85
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:20,966
理由を見つけ 憎しみ合うんだね
...they find reasons to hate one another.

86
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:27,566
生まれたことに 意味がなきゃいられないんだね
They can't bear not having a meaning for their existence.

87
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:38,866
ならこれが私の答えだから
If that's the case, then this is my answer.

88
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:46,466
命が冷える 優しさのせいで
Life turns cold because of kindness.

89
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:51,366
弱さが罪と言うなら 応えて
If weakness is a sin, then answer me.

90
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:56,566
私は誰を犠牲に生き
At the expense of whom do I live?

91
00:10:56,766 --> 00:11:02,566
銃口を向けたあなたに見えるように
So that you, with your gun pointed, can see.

92
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:06,066
そして銃声が響く
And then, a gunshot rings out.

93
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:11,966
遠くで聞こえる 罵声と絶叫
Curses and screams can be heard from afar.

94
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,666
正義を問いかける
Questioning what justice is.

95
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:19,066
私は生きる あなたを犠牲に
I will live at your expense.

96
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:23,266
自らの手を汚すこと
Getting my own hands dirty...

97
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:29,466
怯えないで 私は当事者になる
...don't be afraid. I will become the person concerned.

98
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:32,466
今
Now.

99
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:45,316
HiRyS, it's IRyS from Hololive English!

Thank you so much for coming to my first, uh, 3D birthday live.

103
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:04,016

This time, uh, the live is titled "Hope to the Future."

104
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:08,516
This time my live is based on a sci-fi anime song theme.

105
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:14,216
If you've noticed, my first two songs were "Sousei no Aquarion" and "Tojisha"...

106
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,316
...both from sci-fi animes. Yes, let's go! Because sci-fi is my favorite anime genre.

107
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,816
今回のテーマはSFアニソンになっています。
The theme this time is sci-fi anime songs.

108
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:25,516
先ほどの2曲もね、SFアニソンになってるかなと思います。
I think the two previous songs were also sci-fi anime songs.

109
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:28,416
『創聖のアクエリオン』と『当事者』でした。
They were "Sousei no Aquarion" and "Tojisha."

110
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:33,616
And with this wonderful theme, we have this wonderful stage available.

111
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,216
Yes, that staff-san made for me. Thank you so much!

112
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:42,216
It is a sci-fi spaceship. We're in space.

113
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:44,816
Yes, this is an IRyS spaceship.

114
00:12:45,316 --> 00:12:47,116
Thank you very much. It's so pretty!

115
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:51,416
とっても素敵なね、えっと、SFテーマの宇宙船、
We have this really lovely, uh, sci-fi themed spaceship...

116
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:55,716
宇宙船？うん、宇宙船みたいな感じのステージになっています。
...Spaceship? Yeah, it's a stage that feels like a spaceship.

Lyrics ・ Composition ryo(supercell)

127
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:08,066
震え、似てるわ
You're trembling, it looks like...

128
00:14:08,866 --> 00:14:13,366
軋んだみたい
...you're creaking.

129
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:18,566
煉瓦の病棟で
In the brick ward...

130
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:23,666
うまく歌えなくて
...I couldn't sing well.

131
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:29,066
霧に煙る夜
A night clouded in mist...

132
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:35,066
浮かべ赤い月
...where the red moon floats.

133
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:40,566
ほら見て私を
Look at me.

134
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:45,866
目を逸らさないで
Don't look away.

135
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:49,066
黒い鉄格子のなかで
Behind the black iron bars...

136
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:52,066
私は生まれてきたんだ
...is where I was born.

137
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,066
悪意の代償を願い
Wishing for the price of malice...

138
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:59,066
望むがままにお前に
...just as you desired.

139
00:15:00,024 --> 00:18:37,024
名前のない怪物
A Nameless Monster

140
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,324
壊して
Destroy it

141
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:02,824
壊される前に
Before you're destroyed

142
00:15:02,824 --> 00:15:04,624
因果の代償 払い
Paying the price of karma

143
00:15:04,624 --> 00:15:06,324

304
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,240
別れが来ること
If I had known from the start

305
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,840
初めから知っていたなら
that a farewell would come,

306
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
おはよう ありがとう
Good morning, thank you,

307
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,040
ごめんね おやすみを
sorry, and good night—

308
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,140
もっとちゃんと
I wonder if I could

309
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,540
言えていたかなって
have said them more properly.

310
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,140
後悔しているよ
I'm full of regrets.

311

伝えたい言葉で
I'm overflowing with

312
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,540
溢れてる
the words I want to convey.

313
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,040
今の君に
I want to try

314
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,740
触れてみたい
and touch the you right now.

315
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,740
この手で強く
I want to hold you

316
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,540
抱きしめたい
strongly with these hands.

317
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,740
君がいない
Even today, from this world

318
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,340
この世界から 今日も
where you are no longer here,

319
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,340
名前を呼ぶよ
I'll call out your name.

320
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,240
まぶた閉じれば
If I close my eyelids,

321
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,440
いつもそこに
those beloved days

322
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,340
愛しい日々が
are always there,

323
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,840
蘇るよ
being revived.

324
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,640
涙色濡れた
Even memories wet with

325
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:12,340
思い出さえも 切なく煌めく
the color of tears sparkle painfully.

326
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,240
空の色や
Even if the color of the sky

327
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,840
街の音が
or the sounds of the town change,

328
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,440
変わっても想いは
my feelings will remain

329
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,440
消えずに残ってゆくんだね
without ever disappearing.

330
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,940
だからせめて
So at least I want

331
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,840
この声が届いてほしいよ
this voice to reach you.

332
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,440
君へ
To you...

333
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,240
今の日々を
Please love the days

334
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,840
愛していて
you're living now.

そこには僕は
I won't be there,

336
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,940
いないけれど
but...

337
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,440
同じ時代を
please don't forget the fact

338
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,140
共に生きていたこと
that we lived in the same era

339
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,340
忘れないでいて
together.

340
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,140
もしも生まれ
If I'm born again,

341
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,540
変わるのなら
and if we can laugh together,

342
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,240
僕らが笑い合えるなら
I want to meet you once more,

343
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,640
愛を教えて
the one who taught me

344
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,440

この世界は非現実
This world is unreal,

349
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,540
ただ

拘束力で支配し続ける
continuing to rule with binding force.

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,440
ならば 僕は
In that case, I—

359
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,440
僕だけは
at least only I—

360
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:38,540
奇跡的で致命的な マイノリティでありたい
want to be a miraculous and fatal minority.

361
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,440
I can fly high!

No no no, don't worry

420
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:32,748

新しい今日が来ちゃうけど
A new today will come, but...

430

Once again, thank you so much to my JP senpais for accepting my invitation...

488
00:37:30,856 --> 00:37:33,856
And at the end, I really wanted to sing Rising Hope with everyone.

00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:36,556
So I'm really glad I was able to do that. It was one of my dreams.

498
00:38:09,556 --> 00:38:11,556
And now that we're in the halfway mark, we're also at a different place.

499
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,256
ここはどこでしょうか？
Where could we be?

500
00:38:13,556 --> 00:38:16,856

00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:32,056
What kind of seiso song is this seiso Nephilim going to sing?

504
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:35,856
I do not know. No, I do know! I do know, but...

505
00:38:36,256 --> 00:38:38,556
I wonder, I wonder. I'm sure you guys are wondering.

It's very exciting, isn't it?

And that was DEAD OR ALIVE!

00:43:46,864 --> 00:43:51,264
Yes, another beautiful song from the Fafner series.

571
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:55,264
Since I sang Shangri-La for my 3D showcase,

572
00:43:55,264 --> 00:43:58,864
I wanted to sing another Fafner song, so I chose DEAD OR ALIVE.

573
00:43:58,864 --> 00:44:00,164
How did you guys like that?

574
00:44:00,164 --> 00:44:04,264
ファフナーのね、あのDEAD OR ALIVE歌わせていただきました。
I sang Fafner's "DEAD OR ALIVE."

575
00:44:04,264 --> 00:44:08,564
前回のね、あの3Dのお披露目配信ではシャングリラ歌ったので、
In the previous 3D debut stream, I sang "Shangri-La,"

576
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:11,464
それに続けて今回はDEAD OR ALIVE歌わせていただきました。
so following that, I sang "DEAD OR ALIVE" this time.

577
00:44:11,464 --> 00:44:15,564
ファフナー最高なんで、もし見てない方いましたら、見てください。
Fafner is the best, so if you haven't seen it, please watch it.

578
00:44:15,564 --> 00:44:18,964
If you haven't watched Fafner yet, I highly recommend you do,

579
00:44:18,964 --> 00:44:23,464
'cause the songs are amazing and the anime itself is great. Yes.

580
00:44:23,464 --> 00:44:26,564
Ah, and now that we've sung DEAD OR ALIVE,

581
00:44:26,564 --> 00:44:30,864
I think we are past the halfway line of this live.

582
00:44:30,864 --> 00:44:33,264
And now that since that's the case,

583
00:44:33,264 --> 00:44:36,464
I think it's about time we announce something big,

584
00:44:36,464 --> 00:44:41,264
something that I think a lot of you guys were completely expecting

585
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:44,264
because it's, you know, it's the usual stuff.

586
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:47,364
では、えーと、告知タイムに行きましょうか。
Well, shall we move on to the announcement time?

587
00:44:47,364 --> 00:44:53,364
みんながおそらく期待していたというか、まあいつものね、告知させていただきます。
I'll make the announcement that everyone was probably expecting, or rather, the usual one.

588
00:44:53,364 --> 00:44:54,564

601
00:45:47,172 --> 00:45:49,872
From the same art from Piske-sensei!

602
00:45:49,972 --> 00:45:56,572
It is slightly larger or wider than my past birthday mat that I released a couple years ago.

603
00:45:56,672 --> 00:46:03,272
So I think you'll definitely have a need for that. It is going to look very nice on your desk.

604
00:46:03,372 --> 00:46:05,172
Yes, I highly recommend you get it.

605
00:46:05,272 --> 00:46:14,372
今回のデスクマットはね、何年か前の誕生日にリリースしたデスクマットよりちょいと長くなっています。
This desk mat is a bit longer than the desk mat I released for my birthday a few years ago.

606
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:23,972
なので是非々々デスクに広げていただけると、多分このイラストとてもデスクの上で映えると思うんで是非ゲットしてください。
So please, please spread it out on your desk; I think this illustration will look great on your desk so please get it.

607
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:32,472
今回のイラスト自体はね、本当にSFなのでパソコン周りとか全然似合うんじゃないかなと思います。
The illustration itself is really sci-fi, so I think it'll look great around your PC and such.

00:46:33,772 --> 00:46:39,072
Alrighty then, next merch. 次いきましょう。

えっと、今回の衣装じゃない、ゲーマー衣装の再現のジャケットになっています！
Um, it's a jacket that's a reproduction of my gamer outfit!

612
00:46:59,272 --> 00:47:05,972
えっと、今回はね再現と言っても色違いになっています。みんなが使いやすいような黒にさせていただきました。
Um, even though it's a reproduction, this time it's in a different color. I chose black so it's easier for everyone to use.

613
00:47:06,072 --> 00:47:11,272
でもデザイン自体はお揃いのデザインになっています。
But the design itself is a matching design.

614
00:47:11,372 --> 00:47:15,572
多分とってもかっこいいので、是非ゲットしてください。
I think it's very cool, so please get it.

615
00:47:15,672 --> 00:47:24,272
And as I mentioned before, I think maybe in a past stream that I wanted to release a jacket, matching jacket. Yay!

616
00:47:24,372 --> 00:47:30,572
It is in a different color, it is in black so that it'll be easier for all of you guys to wear.

617
00:47:30,672 --> 00:47:38,272
But the design is going to be matching with my gamer outfit, so I think it'd be nice to be matching. Yay!

618
00:47:38,372 --> 00:47:43,072
Please do get it, let's match together. Yeah.

619
00:47:43,172 --> 00:47:47,372
今回のね、お揃いなので、是非アイリスとお揃いにしよう。お揃いにしよう。
It's matching this time, so let's match with IRyS. Let's match.

620
00:47:47,472 --> 00:47:48,872
是非購入お願いします。ありがとうございます。
Please consider purchasing it. Thank you.

621
00:47:50,072 --> 00:47:56,572
Alright, and then next up, we have more clothes. まだお洋服系のグッズありますよ。
Alright, and then next up, we have more clothes. There's still more clothes-type merch.

622
00:47:56,672 --> 00:49:10,872
The GuyRyS Cap

623
00:47:57,772 --> 00:48:02,572
We have the GuyRyS Cap! Woo!

624
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:09,272
Finally! I'm sure a lot of you guys wanted a GuyRyS cap for the longest time, ever since GuyRyS came to existence.

625
00:48:09,372 --> 00:48:13,872
It is a white cap with the GuyRyS logo on it!

626
00:48:13,972 --> 00:48:18,472
Yes, it has your face on it, and it is white because, you know, GuyRyS' cap has to be white.

627
00:48:18,572 --> 00:48:22,572
It is going to look amazing with the jacket, so I think it'd be best to buy it as a set. Yes.

628
00:48:22,672 --> 00:48:30,572
Please do get it. If you are an Aristocrat, you need the GuyRyS cap. Buy it! Buy it now! Yay!

629
00:48:30,672 --> 00:48:37,472
今回のね、アイリスのファン層のガイリスの帽子になっています。帽子を再現しました。
This is a cap for the GuyRyS, IRyS' fan base. I've reproduced the cap.

630
00:48:37,572 --> 00:48:42,572
帽子はね、ガイリスのキャラクターでも白い帽子被ってるんで、その白い帽子になっています。
As for the cap, since the GuyRyS character wears a white cap, it's that white cap.

631
00:48:42,672 --> 00:48:48,872
それでガイリスの顔が写ってる帽子になっています。
It's a cap with GuyRyS' face on it.

632
00:48:48,972 --> 00:48:55,372
あのね、ガイリス、アイリスのリスナーさんだったらこの帽子被んないとダメでしょ！
You know, if you're a GuyRyS, a listener of IRyS, you have to wear this cap!

633
00:48:55,472 --> 00:48:56,872
購入してちょ！
Please buy it!

634
00:48:57,072 --> 00:49:06,572
あとジャケットと、黒いジャケットと多分いい色のコントラストになると思うんで、是非一緒に買って一緒に着装してください。
Also, I think it'll make a nice color contrast with the black jacket, so please buy them together and wear them together.

635
00:49:10,872 --> 00:49:59,405

It is a special stream to thank my members. I will be singing more songs there.

660
00:51:53,680 --> 00:52:04,280
そちらの方でもね、アイリス歌うんで、こちらの配信でね、えっと、「もうちょっとアイリスの曲、アイリスの歌聴きたいなー」っていう気分になった方はぜひぜひ、
I'll be singing there too, so if this stream leaves you feeling like you want to hear a bit more of my songs and singing, then...

ふー、ではではでは。
Whew, now then...

663
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:30,280
Now that I have announced my merch, I think we're getting towards the last part, but there is still more singing obviously.

664
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:36,480
And since we're singing more songs, I think we need to move back to the arena, this very arena! Yeah!

665
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:46,480
えっと、まだ曲歌いますけど、そろそろ、あの、最後の方になってきましたんで、えっと、次の曲はね、えっと、またアリーナの方に戻りたいなーと思っています。
I'll still be singing songs, but we're getting near the end, so for the next song, I'd like to return to the arena.

666
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,080
では、いきましょう！Let's go!
So, let's go! Let's go!

667
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:03,080
花びら　散りゆく
Petals falling away

00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:13,280
それなら　涙は
In that case, the tears...

670
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,480
何処へと還らん
To where shall they return?

671
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,780
仕組まれている
It is being contrived

672
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,180
終結さえも
Even the end

673
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,280
求め過ぎてた
I had sought too much

674
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,380
答えならば
For the answer

675
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,680
記号の中で
Within the symbols

The destination

678
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,380

No one decided this

委ねる事に
To yielding

心のままに
As your heart desires

722
00:58:01,088 --> 00:58:03,088
Encore! Encore!

723
00:58:04,588 --> 00:58:07,588
Encore! Encore!

724
00:58:08,288 --> 00:58:13,588
Eh? I just used up all my energy and broke into pieces, though.

725
00:58:14,388 --> 00:58:16,888
どうしようかな？
What should I do?

726
00:58:17,388 --> 00:58:20,088
しゃあないな...
Can't be helped...

727
00:58:20,588 --> 00:58:22,588
I'll sing one last song for you guys.

728
00:58:23,088 --> 00:58:25,588
Oh, and merch sales start at 10:05

729
00:58:25,588 --> 00:58:28,088
and my membership-only part will start at 10:15. So don't miss it!

730
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:32,088
Now please listen to my last song for the stream, Garnet.

731
00:58:47,588 --> 00:58:53,588
グラウンド駆けてくあなたの背中は
Your back as you run across the ground

732
00:58:54,088 --> 00:58:59,588
空に浮かんだ雲よりも自由で
Is freer than the clouds floating in the sky

733
00:59:00,088 --> 00:59:06,588
ノートに並んだ四角い文字さえ
Even the square characters lined up in my notebook

734
00:59:07,088 --> 00:59:12,588
すべてを照らす光に見えた
Looked like light illuminating everything

735
00:59:15,588 --> 00:59:21,088
好きという気持ちが分からなくて
Not understanding what it felt like to love

736
00:59:22,088 --> 00:59:27,588
二度とは戻らないこの時間が
This time that will never return

737
00:59:28,088 --> 00:59:35,088
その意味をあたしに教えてくれた
Taught me its meaning

738
00:59:40,088 --> 00:59:46,088
あなたと過ごした日々をこの胸に焼き付けよう
I'll sear the days spent with you into my heart

739
00:59:46,588 --> 00:59:52,588
思い出さなくても大丈夫なように
So that it's okay even if I don't remember them

740
00:59:53,088 --> 00:59:59,088
いつか他の誰かを好きになったとしても
Even if I fall in love with someone else someday

741
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,396
...ああ
...Ah

742
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:03,596
ずっと
Always,

743
01:00:03,596 --> 01:00:06,596
特別で
so special

744
01:00:06,596 --> 01:00:09,596
大切で
and precious,

745
01:00:09,596 --> 01:00:15,596
またこの季節が巡ってくる
this season comes around again.

746
01:00:24,796 --> 01:00:30,996
初めて二人で話した放課後
That time after school when we first talked,

747
01:00:30,996 --> 01:00:37,696
誰も知らない笑顔探していた
I was looking for a smile no one knew about.

748
01:00:37,696 --> 01:00:44,296
遠くであなたのハシャいでる声に
Hearing your playful voice in the distance,

749
01:00:44,296 --> 01:00:50,596
なぜだか胸が痛くなったの
my heart somehow started to ache.

750
01:00:52,596 --> 01:00:59,096
変わってゆく事を怖がってたの
I was afraid of things changing.

751
01:00:59,096 --> 01:01:05,596
ずっと友達のままでいれる気がした
I felt like we could stay friends forever.

752
01:01:05,596 --> 01:01:12,096
終わってく物など無いと思った
I thought that nothing would ever end.

753
01:01:17,296 --> 01:01:23,796
果てしない時間の中で あなたと出会えた事が
Meeting you in the midst of endless time

754
01:01:23,796 --> 01:01:30,196
何よりもあたしを強くしてくれたね
has made me stronger than anything else.

755
01:01:30,196 --> 01:01:36,696
夢中でかける明日に 辿り着いたとしても
Even if I reach the tomorrow I'm racing toward,

756
01:01:36,696 --> 01:01:40,496
あなたは ずっと
you will always

757
01:01:41,596 --> 01:01:44,596
特別で
be special

758
01:01:44,596 --> 01:01:47,596
大切で
and precious,

759
01:01:47,596 --> 01:01:53,096
またこの季節がやってくる
as this season comes around once more.

01:02:18,596 --> 01:02:24,096
いつまでも忘れないと あなたが言ってくれた夏
The summer you told me you'd never forget...

761
01:02:30,596 --> 01:02:37,096
時間が流れ 今頃あたしは 涙がこぼれてきた
Time has passed, and now, my tears are falling.

762
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:54,096
あなたと過ごした日々を この胸に焼き付けよう
I'll burn the days I spent with you into my heart,

763
01:02:54,096 --> 01:03:00,096
思い出さなくても 大丈夫なように
so I'll be okay even if I don't remember.

764
01:03:00,096 --> 01:03:06,596
いつか他の誰かを 好きになったとしても
Even if I fall in love with someone else someday,

765
01:03:06,596 --> 01:03:12,096
あなたは ずっと
you will always

766
01:03:12,096 --> 01:03:14,596
