3D SHOWCASE

00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Nerissa Ravencroft

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:12,000
8/9 20:00 PDT | 8/10 12:00 JST

5
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:34,116
I was bored to tears

6
00:02:34,258 --> 00:02:36,142
felt like 10,000 years

7
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:38,116
every back and forth

8
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,400
cut me like a knife

9
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,508
but then a sight in your eyes

10
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,600
and it took me by surprise

11
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,608
and 10,000 volts

12
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,808
brought my heart to life

13
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:51,275
and I want you here right now

14
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,300
you know 'cause I'm ready to let go

15
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,675
get me through the night somehow

16
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:58,192
show me all you know

17
00:02:58,983 --> 00:03:00,825
my lips are a mystery

18
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,775
one kiss and you'll agree

19
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:04,933
if you're down to get familiarized

20
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:07,408
then baby say it right

21
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:10,433
N-E-R-I-S-S-A

22
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:11,858
'kay?

23
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,216
Play with fire

24
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,142
take me higher

25
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,525
if you want to play the game

26
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,733
yeah you gotta say my name

27
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:23,008
Play with fire

28
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,016

29
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:27,416

31
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:31,508
burning up the floor

32
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,408
you got a vibe I can't ignore

33
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:35,342
in a sea of embers

34
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:37,316
dancing way into the night

35
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,375
the best is yet to come

36
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,342
'cause you're not like anyone

37
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,308
looking out for someone

38
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:45,316
shining so bright

39
00:03:46,408 --> 00:03:48,308
there's a scent that's filling up the air

40
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,316
and you're still unaware

41
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,425
that you're falling fast under my spell

42
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,642
oh baby it isn't fair

43
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,625
'cause when I mix up this illusion

44
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,742
I am anyone and everyone

45
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,825
all logic fades away tonight

46
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,242

47
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,416

YEAH YOU GOTTA SAY MY NAME

83
00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:57,008
Hi-ya darlings! This is Hololive English Advent's

84
00:05:57,008 --> 00:06:00,808
devilish diva, and today, I'm here hosting a cooking show

85
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:04,208
in my very own kitchen, "Delicious Demonic Dishes"!

86
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:08,508
As you can see, it's basically my kitchen, however,

87
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:12,008
I must tell you this is actually a replica. If you'd like to look

88
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:15,808
on the other side... Yes, you can see the Jailbirds

89
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:21,008
hard at work making sure that this show goes on without a hitch.

90
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:23,808
But, today is also about me!

91
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:28,508
As you can see, it's my 3D debut! How do I look? How is it?

92
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:31,008
Am I beautiful? Am I kawaii? Am I...

93
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:35,508
mecha sexy? (Laughs)

94
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:39,008
Oh, you could look me up and down, I suppose.

95
00:06:39,008 --> 00:06:43,008
Starting with my lovely shoes... going all the way up

96
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:46,508
to my skirt... and you might realize something's missing.

97
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:51,008
Since we're cooking today, I've decided to remove my jacket.

98
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:54,008
So say goodbye to my wings.

99
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:58,208
But without further ado, I suppose we ought to get cooking,

100
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,808
right? Get right onto things! So, first,

101
00:07:00,808 --> 00:07:05,508
I suppose I have two lovely guests I'd like you to meet,

102
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,508
if they'd like to come on out!

103
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:10,008
Keke-riki! Hi!

00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,508

If anyone's qualified to do this, it's me.

321
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:50,962
As a past KFP.

322
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:51,996
Oh my god!

I can't even look!

335
00:15:10,516 --> 00:15:12,016
Do you think he's too big?

336
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:14,516
I think maybe he needs to be a bit smaller, don't you?

337
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:15,516
Really?

338
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:16,516
I'll do it! Stop!

339
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:17,816
I'm getting so small!

00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:20,516
Stop!

うわ、完璧です。Perfect.
Wow, it's perfect. Perfect.

Thank you, Jimmy, for your contribution.

00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:28,816
Gosh, this is so sad.

345
00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:30,516
It's okay. He'd be happy.

346
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:32,516
Are... Is this going to be enough for all of us?

353
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:51,516
Oh, let me take it up so you can see clearly.

354
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:53,216
Mhm, secret spice.

355
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:55,016
Yeah, it's got secret spices in it.

356
00:15:55,016 --> 00:15:58,516
We're getting deep in there, Tenchou. Ah!

357
00:15:58,516 --> 00:16:00,016
Jimmy looking shiny.

358
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:01,516
Yeah. Wow!

359
00:16:01,516 --> 00:16:04,516
Okay, and then we go into the flour. The flour.

360
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:09,016
Oh, it's nice and coated.

361
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:13,516
As you can see, some spices were mixed onto that too, but they're secret. Secret.

362
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:15,016
Nice.

363
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:19,516
Okay, and with that, it's time. We have a 160 degrees Celsius heated up...

364
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:23,516
...oil thingy. What's it called?

365
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:24,516
So dangerous.

366
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:26,516
A deep fryer.

367
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:27,516
Deep fryer! Yeah, I knew that. That was also a test question.

368
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:30,516
So... here we go!

369
00:16:30,516 --> 00:16:33,516
Oh, stick it in! And another one!

370
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:37,016
My wing! My wing! It's so hot!

371
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:39,016
Oh, so dangerous!

372
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:41,016
Oh, it's already... oh, it's already finished.

373
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:42,016
Whoa, that was fast.

374
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:43,016
Oh my god!

375
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:44,516

Hot! Hot! It's on the floor! Oh, it's on the floor!

Ah! Yay!

380
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:59,816
Yay! You've got... you've got crazy hands to be able to handle that sort of heat, Phoenix.

381
00:17:00,016 --> 00:17:04,516
I guess so. It doesn't feel like anything at all. Yeah, nothing at all.

382
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,516
Fini!

383
00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:08,516

390
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:30,516

00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,516
We're really eating chicken right now.

394
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,516
Mmm!

395
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:43,516
Mmm! Na, I did a good job.
Mmm! See, I did a good job.

396
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:44,516
You did!

397
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:48,516
Wait, there's like a lemony taste in it, I think. Where's the lemon come from?

398
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:50,016
Did I put lemon in there?

399
00:17:50,016 --> 00:17:51,216
You must have.

400
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:53,816
Maybe you put zest? It was in the batter already probably.

401
00:17:53,816 --> 00:17:55,016
Mhm. 美味しい。
Mhm. It's delicious.

402
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:57,516
Shouldn't you know? You're the CEO.

403
00:17:57,516 --> 00:18:01,516
Um... spice is good. I let my my Jimmys work for me.

00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:05,516
Mmm! Mhm! Na, this is really really good. Mhm.
Mmm! Mhm! Man, this is really really good. Mhm.

405
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:08,516
Maybe a little bit... dry?

406
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:11,516
It's very juicy.

407
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:15,016
After one bite, yeah... I want to more bite. Yeah.

408
00:18:15,016 --> 00:18:17,516
More bite. More bite. I want to eat. Yeah.

409
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:19,516
I want some sauce. I want sweet-sour sauce.

410
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,516
Mmm, so delicious.

411
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:24,516
I understand.

412
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:28,516
Oh, yeah. It's good party food.

413
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:31,516
We're having a party. Yeah! Should we do a sleepover too? I would like that.

414
00:18:31,516 --> 00:18:35,516
Yeah, in-your-background party. Good job.

415
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:38,016
Thank you, thank you. Dankeschon. Dankeschon.

417
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:45,516
KFP, you're the best. Thank you for your dedication.

418
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:48,516
Thank you, Jimmy! Thank you, world! Thank you, KFP!

419
00:18:51,516 --> 00:18:55,516
You know, you guys have both cooked, but I haven't cooked anything yet, actually.

420
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:59,016
So, I think I have something special. It's not technically my dish.

421
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:03,016
However, it's using things from HoloLive English...

422
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,516
to make something 美味しいです。美味しいそう。
...to make something delicious. It looks delicious.

423
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:11,516
So, if you'd like, without further ado, I would like to cook for you, so let's go!

424
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:17,016
Let's go! Thank you, Rissa cooking! It better be good! Cooking fried!

427
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:31,016
Uh... well, behind us, what we have all of the ingredients. If you'll take a look...

428
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:36,516
I call this dish: HoloLive Soup. HoloEN Soup. Very good.

429
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:42,516
Wait, Nerissa... Why, Nerissa?

430
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:47,516
No, no, no. These were donated by my senpais to me to make a soup with.

431
00:19:47,516 --> 00:19:53,016
I asked senpai, I said, 'I want to make a delicious soup, so what will you give me?' And these...

432
00:19:53,516 --> 00:19:57,516
Eh? Sorry, I important job. Okay, see you, see you, see you!
Eh? Sorry, I have an important job. Okay, see you, see you, see you!

433
00:19:57,516 --> 00:20:05,016
See you! Let's give her a chance, maybe... yeah, we'll try. It could be good. We don't know yet. Go, go, all right.

434
00:20:06,657 --> 00:20:07,907
Yes, I guess I'll get started.

435
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,782
Oh, okay. Right into it.

436
00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:14,157
So, uh, we're going to be making it in this big cauldron.

437
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:16,032
Ooh! Magical, mystical.

438
00:20:16,157 --> 00:20:20,282
And we're starting out with some chicken salt donated by Bae-senpai.

439
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:22,907
She gave me that before as a present!

440
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:24,532
Oh! Oh hey! Hey!

441
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,532
I'm so sorry! You can't do that!

442
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:28,532
Oh my God, Bijou, take it out!

443
00:20:28,657 --> 00:20:32,532
No, I, you know, I think it's fine. I think it's fine that way.

444
00:20:32,657 --> 00:20:35,032
Oh... Why? Oh, what's next?

445
00:20:35,157 --> 00:20:38,532
Uh, this is donated by Shiori. It's an eggplant...

446
00:20:38,657 --> 00:20:42,532
...and it looks like Yorick, her little mascot guy.

447
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:44,282
It's so... it's so cute, isn't he?

448
00:20:44,407 --> 00:20:47,532
So yeah, just plop! Right in there.

449
00:20:47,657 --> 00:20:49,532
Oh! Oh, not cutting?

450
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:53,532
Oh yeah, you know, if we cook it long enough it'll like disintegrate, right?

451
00:20:53,657 --> 00:20:57,532
Alright, alright. So yeah, it doesn't really make sense to cut it up...

452
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,532
...because it's going to cut itself up.

453
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:04,532
Okay, like what do you have the kitchen for, right? Under a knife, we don't need that. No cutting.

454
00:21:04,657 --> 00:21:08,532
And this one, can you predict who it could be from?

455
00:21:08,657 --> 00:21:13,532
It says... Bijou's feet salt? Feet salt! Feet flakes!

456
00:21:13,657 --> 00:21:15,532
Yeah! No!

457
00:21:15,657 --> 00:21:19,532
So just... oh my god! Oh my god!

458
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:21,532
I can like smell the salt.

459
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:23,532
Really? It's okay.

460
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,532
Now we have this... this is from Mumei-senpai.

461
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:29,532
Don't drop the whole thing! Try to be more careful! Maybe this time...

462
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:33,532
Okay, ah! Here! Careful, careful, careful!

463
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:37,532
Oh my God! It's okay! 大丈夫！大丈夫！
Oh my God! It's okay! It's okay! It's okay!

464
00:21:37,657 --> 00:21:42,532
Horrible! Why 大丈夫？ Why 大丈夫？ Why did you start?
Horrible! Why okay? Why okay? Why did you start?

465
00:21:42,657 --> 00:21:46,532
No, not 大丈夫. We still have the sapling!
No, not okay. We still have the sapling!

466
00:21:46,657 --> 00:21:50,532
Still have a sapling, which I'm sure this will absorb all the salt, right?

467
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:54,532
Our veggies, yes! So good.

468
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:56,532
But first, I want to cut off this...

469
00:21:56,657 --> 00:21:58,532
Oh! No! It's sad!

470
00:21:58,657 --> 00:22:00,532
Sorry about your haircut.

471
00:22:00,657 --> 00:22:05,532
Ah, hey! Yeah, well, I guess that's fine. Could have cut it a bit more, it's small.

472
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,532
And then we just have a little bit of garnish to put on top.

473
00:22:09,657 --> 00:22:13,532
How about we eat separately? No, no, no, they're donuts!

474
00:22:13,657 --> 00:22:17,532
Donated by Fuwawa and Mococo respectively.

475
00:22:17,657 --> 00:22:21,532
They each gave me one, so let's go ahead and put them in!

476
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:23,532
Oh no! No! Oh no!

477
00:22:23,657 --> 00:22:27,532
However, it doesn't stop there. Now we have to stir the soup.

478
00:22:27,657 --> 00:22:32,532
So we have to give it a really good stir with all those ingredients.

479
00:22:32,657 --> 00:22:34,532
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

480
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:38,532
Oh yeah, I think it's... look, it's coming together!

481
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,532
You see the colors? Green!

482
00:22:41,657 --> 00:22:45,532
Yes, the color... it's fine, it's fine. Look, it's not even there yet.

483
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:49,532
No, that looks like melon soda or something.

484
00:22:49,657 --> 00:22:54,532
Just a little more, huh? Perfect! Much better! Much better!

485
00:22:54,657 --> 00:22:57,532
Yeah, not perfect. 紫スープ。
Yeah, not perfect. Purple soup.

486
00:22:57,657 --> 00:22:59,532
Oh, 紫スープ。 はい。
Oh, purple soup. Yes.

487
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:04,532
Oh my God. It's perfect. It looks like something from Hololive, right?

488
00:23:04,657 --> 00:23:09,532
And no. Don't you think? I'm sure it's delicious.

489
00:23:09,657 --> 00:23:14,532
I don't want to eat. Yeah, you don't want to eat... Really good 肉じゃが。
I don't want to eat. Yeah, you don't want to eat... Really good meat and potato stew.

490
00:23:14,782 --> 00:23:19,532
Is there more 肉じゃが？ More 肉じゃが？ Can we just finish?
Is there more meat and potato stew? More? Can we just finish?

491
00:23:19,657 --> 00:23:24,532
So let's try! Let's eat! Let's eat! Let's eat!

492
00:23:24,657 --> 00:23:28,532
No, oh my god, oh my god. No, no, no, I don't need... let's eat!

493
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,532
It's fine, you guys have to taste it! No, oh my god!

494
00:23:32,657 --> 00:23:37,532
You don't have to try, get back here! It's... this is... I'm your oshi so you have to!

00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:07,532
Looks like grape juice... it shouldn't look like that. Oh, no.

503
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:12,532
No, it's okay, let's try it! Without further ado, abomination!

504
00:24:12,657 --> 00:24:16,532
How's it smell? How's the, uh, good point?

505
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:18,532
Eh? Smell is okay.

506
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:23,532
Oh! Smell is okay! See? See? See? Smell is okay!

507
00:24:23,657 --> 00:24:25,532
Come on, don't knock it before you try it.

508
00:24:25,657 --> 00:24:29,532
It's like burning my nostrils. It'll be okay.

509
00:24:29,657 --> 00:24:32,532
いただきます！ Same timing.
Let's eat! Same timing.

510
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:37,532
No! What did you do to us? Oh my god! I didn't do anything!

511
00:24:37,657 --> 00:24:42,532
She poisoned us! Oh my god! Maybe she wants to take control of Holotori!

512
00:24:42,657 --> 00:24:47,532
No! No, no, no! I... it's not... it's really not that bad!

513
00:24:47,657 --> 00:24:52,532
Ugh, what have you... call you alive? It's not that bad, it's fine!

514
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:57,532
Give... you're delicious! Yeah, I'll try again, see? Maybe hers tastes different.

515
00:24:57,657 --> 00:25:00,532
Oh my god. Is it the same? Yeah, same.

516
00:25:00,657 --> 00:25:05,532
Yeah, same, same, same. Cannot. No, sorry, Nerissa.

517
00:25:05,657 --> 00:25:10,532
It's hearty and it's filling! Enough, enough. Thank you.

518
00:25:10,657 --> 00:25:14,532
This is not how you can treat your senpais. No!

519
00:25:14,657 --> 00:25:19,532
Congratulations 3D debut, congratulations! Stop! Bye-bye!

Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye-bye.

525
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:14,549
Unbelievable.

526
00:25:14,749 --> 00:25:16,549
I can't believe this. Well, of course, Jailbirds...

527
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:21,549
...I'm sure you don't think such a thing about my cooking, right?

528
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:26,549
Surely you see it and you thought, "Ah, the brilliant purple color is wonderful!"

529
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:29,849
So... uh, won't you tell me? Won't you praise me?

530
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:32,549
Come on, Jailbirds, don't you like it?

531
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:33,849
Wait, wasn't it delicious?

532
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:35,549
Ah! What the...! Stop!

533
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:44,249
No! Ah! No! Stop it! Oh! No!

534
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:47,549
I guess that's it for my cooking show.

535
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:51,549
This is probably the pilot episode and the only episode.

536
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:55,249
So, I guess if you enjoyed it, we won't be back.

537
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:59,049
So... time to distract you with a song performance!

538

I didn't quite see you there.

609
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:38,466
It's not that kind of thing though.

610
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:40,266
Welcome to my studio.

611
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:44,266
This is where I do all of my recording.

612
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:47,566
Of course you've heard of it, but this is your first time being here.

613
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:50,266

I know you guys are always begging to see him, so there you go.

620
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:06,066
And now that we're done cooking,

621
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:09,266
I've gone ahead and put my jacket back on.

622
00:32:09,266 --> 00:32:10,866
Very nice, right?

623
00:32:10,866 --> 00:32:13,066
It really adds to the appeal.

624
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:16,566

00:32:31,066 --> 00:32:36,266

00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:38,066

Yeah?

641
00:32:58,566 --> 00:33:04,266
Well, I'm so excited because we have a song we're going to be performing for all of you.

642
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:08,566
I know, a trio between Calliope, Marine, and Nerissa. Who would have thunk it?

643
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:10,566
But the team is not quite ready yet.

644
00:33:10,566 --> 00:33:13,566
So first I thought we could 練習...
So first I thought we could practice...

645
00:33:13,566 --> 00:33:16,566
practice a script that we are performing.

646
00:33:16,566 --> 00:33:19,566
Because you know, we are professional actors. はい。
Because you know, we are professional actors. Yes.

647
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:21,066
Yeah, this thing.

648
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:24,066
This thing, that script.

649
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:25,566
That script for that thing.

650
00:33:25,566 --> 00:33:27,366
Yeah, do you remember what our show is called?

651
00:33:27,366 --> 00:33:29,066
I sure do,

652
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:33,566
but can you go ahead and I guess recite it for the audience who doesn't know.

653
00:33:33,566 --> 00:33:35,366
It is going to be... um... good question,

654
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:38,366
yeah... it's on here, you see?

655
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:40,066
Oh, check it. Can you read?

656
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:42,066
Yeah, totally. Can you read?

657
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:45,566
I think, "A Brush with Death: A Pirate's Tale".

658
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:51,366
So please look forward to it coming out on hololivetv.com.

I... I... finished! My present, please!

669
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:11,566
私……やりました！ごほうび……ください。
I... I... finished! My present, please!

670
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:18,366
A wonderful job finding my lost wares, Captain.

671
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:18,366
私が失いしものをよくぞ見つけました。
A wonderful job finding my lost wares.

672
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:24,566
But you must realize this was not the treasure I spoke of.

673
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:24,566
しかしそれは私の言った『宝物』ではありません。
But you must realize this was not the treasure I spoke of.

674
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:26,066
What!?

675
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:26,066
え！
What!?

676
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:28,566
Of course not! It never was.

677
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:34,566
It was always about what you had, not what I lost.

678
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:34,566
全ッ然違います！私ではなく、あなたが持っていたものとの方なのです！
Of course not! It was always about what you had, not what I lost!

679
00:34:34,566 --> 00:34:39,566
All of these things were stolen from my

680
00:34:39,566 --> 00:34:42,566
idiot siblings thousands of years ago.

681
00:34:34,566 --> 00:34:42,566
この宝は全て、何千年も前に私の姉妹が盗まれたもの！
All of these were stolen from my siblings thousands of years ago!

682
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:48,566
I planted these here for safe keeping, and they were safe,

683
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:52,566
at least until the waves took this place.

684
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:52,566
宝はここに埋めて隠していたのですが、ある日大波が全部さらっていってしまった……。
I planted these here for safe keeping, until the waves took them...

685
00:34:52,566 --> 00:34:55,066
You lost the whole island!?

686
00:34:52,566 --> 00:34:55,066
島ごと全部失くしたってこと？
You lost the whole island!?

687
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:57,066
What!? No!

688
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:57,066
ち、違います！
W-What!? No!

689
00:34:57,066 --> 00:35:01,866
What I am saying is I knew where it was the whole time! I...

690
00:34:57,066 --> 00:35:01,866
宝のありかははずっと分かっていました！ただ……
I knew where it was the whole time! However...

691
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,566
But... what did she see in you?

692
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,566
こんなやつがよかったんだ？
Did you really like this fellow?

693
00:35:04,566 --> 00:35:09,566
A beautiful young woman like her, with an old hag like you.

694
00:35:04,566 --> 00:35:09,566
あんあ素敵な女性が、こんなババアと……。
A lovely woman like her, with an old hag like you...

695
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,066
Old hag!?

696
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,066
ババア！？
Old hag!?

697
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:13,566
I am young, beautiful!

698
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:13,566
若くて美人でしょうが！
I'm young and beautiful!

699
00:35:13,566 --> 00:35:16,066
Yeah, and I'm the Goddess of Death.

700
00:35:13,566 --> 00:35:16,066
じゃあ私は死神でも名乗ろうかしら。
Well then, maybe I'll call myself the Reaper.

701
00:35:16,066 --> 00:35:20,066
Look at you, you're creeping slowly towards your grave.

702
00:35:16,066 --> 00:35:20,066
「自称」より言ったもの勝ちですものね？
It's better to say it than to just 'self-proclaim', right?

703
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:07,083
はあ！？
Hah!?

704
00:35:07,183 --> 00:35:12,083
I'm a sexy captain! Pirate captain! Hmph.

705
00:35:14,383 --> 00:35:16,083
Yes, well. Moving on...

706
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:19,883
I've brought you here to exact my revenge on you, Captain...

707
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:23,083
...for the untimely death of your lover.

708
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,483
I know that you were the one to take her life...

709
00:35:25,483 --> 00:35:29,083
...and I will not stand for it! You will suffer by my hands!

710
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:32,583
はあ！？ちょっと待って...
Hah!? Wait a minute...

711
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:39,083
You know, this quest was just a distraction. It was meant to keep you from watching over your...

712
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:45,083
...beautiful and sexy lover. And leave room for me to take your place.

713
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:51,083
But now your lover is dead, and I am left with a hole in my heart.

714
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:54,083
You will pay for what you've done here and now!

715
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:57,083
That's enough of that!

716
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:03,083
Death? What are you doing here? Don't you usually work the graveyard shift?

717
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:06,583
Unless you're planning on bringing back my beautiful little bird to me,

718
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:11,583
you can turn right around and poof yourself back to wherever it is you came from.

719
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:17,083
Well, maybe you don't know me as well as you pretend to.

720
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:19,583
Or the pirate captain, as well as you think either.

721
00:36:20,383 --> 00:36:21,083
あっ...！
Ah...!

722
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:24,083
Look, you can go ahead and smite that human if you like.

723
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:27,083
I'm not going to try and stop you.

724
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:30,083
But I really think you might regret doing that.

725
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:33,583
You would take the side of someone so cruel

726
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:36,583
that they would take the life of their own lover?

727
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:39,083
I expected better of you!

728
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:44,083
Besides, how am I supposed to take their place

729
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:48,083
and make that beautiful cream puff my wife if this fool here has killed her?

730
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:51,583
Wait, what? You want the Captain!?

731
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:54,583
No! Where did you even get that from?

732
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:59,083
Why would you even think that I would want someone as old and badly dressed as you?

733
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,083
でもでも……
But, but...

734
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:04,583
No, it has always been that treasure box of wonder.

735
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:06,583
That twin-tail talent.

736
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,583
That sweet girl who can do no sin,

737
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,583
that you kept back on land!

738
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,583
That is the one I have wanted!

739
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:17,083
You? No, not at all.

740
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:22,583
Yeah, but you just called that treasure box of wonder a hag not too minutes ago.

741
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:26,083
What are you even talking about?

742
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:30,083
I called this wrinkly old wreck here in front of me a hag, not my beautiful bride-to-be!

743
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:35,083
Oh man, this is rich. You really have no idea, do you, Nerissa?

744
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:36,583
Why are you laughing!?

745
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:41,083
I am not old! I am 17!

746
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:47,083
Let me see if I can help you here. Maybe all the beauty is being hidden by...

747
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,083
...this!

748
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:54,083
I am not the pirate captain!

749
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:59,083
No, she is actually his much more beautiful lover, who you claim to love.

750
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:03,083
That's right, here is the Marine you thought was lost.

751
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:08,083
That's not possible! I would have known! Or... I would never have...

752
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:11,583
I have a lot to say, but my most pressing question is:

753
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,083
How on earth did you not know?

754
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:17,583
You know, that's fair, because they look nothing alike.

755
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:19,583
But how was I supposed to know?

756
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:24,583
How did such a simple mustache make her look so decidedly unattractive?

757
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:27,083
It's just a mustache!

758
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:29,083
I'm still cute!

759
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,583
Of course you are, dear. She's just an imbecile.

760
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,083
Wait, why am I still mean?

761
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:36,083
Let me change that. Um, anyway...

762
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:41,083
But my dear, her stupidity can't protect you now that you've broken our deal.

763
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:45,083
A broken deal with Death means that your soul is mine!

764
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,583
This is all your fault, drama queen.

765
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:51,583
You claim to love Marine, but you had no idea that she was hiding behind a mustache.

766
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:57,083
Because of your idiocy... her soul is mine now!

767
00:38:57,583 --> 00:39:00,083
Me? How was I supposed to know?

768
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:04,583
She was never supposed to be on this quest in the first place!

769
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:08,083
Wait, if she's here, then that must mean the real Pirate Captain is dead.

770
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:12,583
And that's your domain, Miss Reaper.

771
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:16,083
If the Captain is gone, it means

772
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:19,083
you have had some responsibility in all of this.

773
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:21,083
You could have stopped all of this at any time.

774
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:21,883
無罪！無罪！
Innocent! Innocent!

775
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:25,583
Oh, so you want to blame me for all of this? It wasn't me who killed the Captain.

776
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:30,083
I only protected Marine after she begged for me to help hide her identity from you.

777
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:34,083
She just wanted to complete your stupid quest in honor of her lover.

778
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,583
Yes, but you shouldn't have agreed to hide her.

779
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:42,083
I would have known if you hadn't meddled,

780
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:43,583
and I would have given her my favor without this quest.

781
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,083
魂...?
My soul...?

782
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,083
You're lucky she's here to keep me from hurting you.

783
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:52,583
I'd like to see you try. Besides, this one wasn't me.

784
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:55,583
あの...
Umm...

785
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:58,583
Marine put bananas in his tea.

786
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:00,583
Eh!?

787
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:04,083
Deathly allergic to bananas...

788
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,083
So that's how it was...

789
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,245
Didn't see that one coming. Hehehe.

790
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,200
Marine also wanted an adventure,

791
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,220
but he said no, so banana's...

792
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,850
Uh, that's... huh. Wasn't expecting that.

793
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,900
Unfortunately, that means that you, a human, meddled in matters of life and death.

794
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:28,000
However, after that night you... uh, helped me catch that escaped soul a few weeks back,

795
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,600
I haven't been able to stop thinking about you.

796
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:37,100
It looks like you've already won the heart of the Grim Reaper, so consider yourself lucky.

797
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,500
Oh, that night?!

798
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,000
Night? Don't you dare!

799
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:44,200
I will protect this woman from her own crimes even in death.

800
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,800
No one else has to know that she was the one who took the life of her lover.

801
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,200
It can all just be an unfortunate accident.

802
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,600
Banana peels are known to be slippery.

803
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,400
Calliope!!

804
00:40:54,550 --> 00:41:00,000
No!! She'll never be able to escape the Reaper's clutches and I can't allow that to happen.

805
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:05,900
After all, this is your fault, Mori, for even letting her take this deal in the first place.

806
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,400
But the banana...

807
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:10,600
Mori's doing. It's her fault. Her fault. Ah!

808
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:15,500
Come, Marine... If you come with me, I can protect you from even death itself.

809
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,800
She can't get you in the realm of the immortal.

810
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,500
You absolute...!

811
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,300
But...

812
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,600
Shut up.

813
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,200
You'll be known as the goddess who protected the banana bandit!

814
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,900
The others won't be very happy with you.

815
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:30,000
And you think that matters to me? Why?

816
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,300
Banana...?

817
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,000
They'll blame it on her, of course!

818
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,000
No, the best course of action is for me to take her, to protect her.

819
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,500
Enough talk. Think fast, Nerissa!

820
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,500
Innocent!!

821
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,100
Wait! Just a minute!

822
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,900
Otsu-Karaba-ou!

823
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,300
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you everyone!

824
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,900
And, good news girls! It seems like the music team is already for us,

825
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,400
so why don't we head over and show them our super cool song performance.

826
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,700
Let's do it!

827
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,600
Let's go!

828
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,600
Let's go!

829
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,500
Whoa, cool place you got.

830
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,600
Thank you.

831
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,000
荒れ狂う季節の中を 二人きり さらり
Through the wild seasons, just the two of us, so casually.

832
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:32,400
明けてゆく夕日の中を 今夜も さらり さらり
Through the fading sunset, tonight as well, so casually, so casually.

833
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:46,500
どれほど打ち果てようと 最後には笑いたい
No matter how beaten down I get, I want to laugh at the end.

834
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:57,300
何のために戦おうとも 時は愛以外
No matter what I'm fighting for, time is nothing but love.

835
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:05,000
新しい日々は探さずとも 常にここに
New days are always here, even if I don't look for them.

836
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:12,500
色々見てきたけれど この瞳は永遠に きらり
I've seen many things, but these eyes will forever shine.

837
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:20,300
あれほど生きてきたけど 全ては夢みたい
I've lived so long, but everything seems like a dream.

838
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:28,500
あれもこれも魅力的でも 私は君がいい
Even if this and that are charming, I'd rather have you.

839
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:37,100
どこにいたの 探してたよ 連れてって 連れてって
Where were you? I was looking for you. Take me away, take me away.

840
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:45,300
何もかも捨ててゆくよ どこまでも どこまでも
I'll throw everything away. Anywhere, anywhere.

841
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:53,800
荒れ狂う季節の中を 群衆の中を
Through the wild seasons, through the crowds...

842
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,100
君とならば さらり さらり
If I'm with you, it's so casual, so casual.

843
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:05,300
新しい日々も捨てたもんじゃないね 全てがきらり
New days aren't so bad either, everything is shining.

844
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:28,500
失くしてしまったものを 振り返って ほろり
Looking back at the things I've lost, a tear falls.

845
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:36,900
時には途方に暮れて ただ風に吹かれて ゆらり
Sometimes I'm at a loss, just swaying in the wind.

846
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,500
行き先は聞いたの 行き先は決めたの
I asked for the destination, I decided on the destination.

847
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:45,500
迷わずに行きたいけど しょうがないよね
I want to go without hesitation, but it can't be helped, right?

848
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,500
何かが分かったようで 何も分かってなくて
It seems like I've understood something, but I haven't understood anything.

849
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,500
だけどそれが分かって 本当に良かった
But knowing that makes me really glad.

850
00:44:53,600 --> 00:45:06,100
新しい日々は探さずとも 常にここに ここに ここに ここに
New days are always here, even if I don't look for them, here, here, here...

851
00:45:06,118 --> 00:45:07,318
...と未来とも
...and the future.

852
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:08,418
出逢いとも
Meeting with people.

853
00:45:08,418 --> 00:45:09,818
言えば 握手とも
Or a handshake.

854
00:45:10,018 --> 00:45:12,718
ああ 惹かれてたけれど
Ah, I was drawn to it, but

855
00:45:12,718 --> 00:45:15,718
全ては夢みたい
Everything seems like a dream.

856
00:45:16,118 --> 00:45:18,718
あれもこれも
That and this,

857
00:45:18,718 --> 00:45:21,618
魅力的でも
though they are attractive,

858
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:24,718
私は君がいい
it's you that I want.

859
00:45:32,918 --> 00:45:36,918
どこにいたの 探していたよ
Where were you? I was looking for you.

860
00:45:37,118 --> 00:45:40,618
連れてって 連れてって
Take me away, take me away.

861
00:45:40,918 --> 00:45:44,718
何もかも捨ててくよ
I'll leave everything behind.

862
00:45:45,018 --> 00:45:48,718
どこまでも どこまでも
Anywhere at all, anywhere at all.

863
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:51,718
荒れ狂う季節の中も
Through the raging seasons,

864
00:45:51,718 --> 00:45:54,318
群衆の中も
and through the crowds,

865
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,718
君となら さらり さらり
with you, smoothly and easily.

866
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:01,718
新しい日々も 拙い過去も
New days and a clumsy past,

867
00:46:02,018 --> 00:46:06,718
全てが きらり
it all sparkles.

868
00:46:16,618 --> 00:46:18,718
Ah, yeah!

869
00:46:18,718 --> 00:46:20,718
Thank you guys!

870
00:46:20,718 --> 00:46:22,718
Thank you so much for coming out.

871
00:46:22,718 --> 00:46:23,718
That was so fun!

872
00:46:23,718 --> 00:46:25,718
Thank you!

873
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,618
Oh my god!

874
00:46:29,118 --> 00:46:31,118
大好き チュチュチュ！
I love you! Mwah mwah mwah!

875
00:46:31,718 --> 00:46:34,118
Wow, it's getting hot in here. Calli, thank you for coming too!

876
00:46:34,218 --> 00:46:37,118
Yeah, no problem. I'm happy to be here. Congrats on 3D!

877
00:46:37,118 --> 00:46:39,818
Thank you! It made it so special to have you two as guests...

878
00:46:39,818 --> 00:46:42,718
...and to get to sing with you two. That's crazy!

879
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,718
But we still have one more song after this one.

880
00:46:45,718 --> 00:46:48,218
Not all of us, just me, sadly.

881
00:46:48,218 --> 00:46:50,318
We have to say goodbye to these lovely ladies.

882
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:53,218
But the Jailbird Tech have to set it up...

883
00:46:53,218 --> 00:46:56,218
...so we're going to say goodbye for a few seconds...

884
00:46:56,218 --> 00:46:57,718
...and I'll be right back.

885
00:46:57,718 --> 00:46:58,718
Let's go!

886
00:46:58,718 --> 00:47:00,218
Bye bye!

887
00:47:16,718 --> 00:47:19,718
So, this last song for today is actually going to be...

888
00:47:19,718 --> 00:47:24,218
...the titular track of my new EP, "In My Feelings".

889
00:47:24,218 --> 00:47:26,718
Song is the same name.

890
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,718
I really worked hard on this song. I think it came out great.

891
00:47:29,718 --> 00:47:32,718
So, I hope you guys will enjoy listening to...

892
00:47:32,718 --> 00:47:35,718
...my first live performance of it.

893
00:47:36,218 --> 00:47:38,218
それでは聴いてください。
Please listen.

894
00:48:03,218 --> 00:48:06,718
Can't believe the words that came out of your mouth

895
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:10,718
Never thought that what we have would go this route

896
00:48:11,718 --> 00:48:13,718
Can see the clock is ticking

897
00:48:13,718 --> 00:48:15,718
But I just can't stop thinking

898
00:48:15,718 --> 00:48:19,218
Every little memory's tormenting me

899
00:48:20,418 --> 00:48:23,718
Counting all of my mistakes

900
00:48:23,718 --> 00:48:26,718
Want to sleep but it won't happen

901
00:48:26,718 --> 00:48:29,718
Waiting for the day to break

902
00:48:29,718 --> 00:48:32,718
I'm wide awake reliving the past and

903
00:48:32,718 --> 00:48:35,718
Still haunted by the ghost of you

904
00:48:35,718 --> 00:48:38,718
Everywhere I look it's like you're always there

905
00:48:38,718 --> 00:48:40,718
Despite the fact that I'm on my own

906
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:44,418
I'm in my feelings, like rain fall on the ground

907
00:48:44,418 --> 00:48:47,718
They're soaking through the sheets and drenching every single inch of me

908
00:48:47,718 --> 00:48:51,218
I'm in my feelings, it's falling all around

909
00:48:51,218 --> 00:48:54,718
Inside this never-ending downpour there's no escape to oh far

910
00:48:58,718 --> 00:49:01,718
Thinking about the night you left and you lied

911
00:49:01,718 --> 00:49:05,218
That morning I had woken, my heart that froze and broken

912
00:49:05,718 --> 00:49:09,718
Feeling like I could drown in the tears I cried

913
00:49:10,218 --> 00:49:13,718
Sinking down into the blue

914
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:16,718
Like I'm submerged in water

915
00:49:16,718 --> 00:49:19,718
Chills straight down to the bone

916
00:49:19,718 --> 00:49:22,718
Struggling to breathe just thinking about it

917
00:49:22,718 --> 00:49:25,718
Still haunted by the ghost of you

918
00:49:25,718 --> 00:49:28,718
Everywhere I look it's like you're always there

919
00:49:28,718 --> 00:49:30,718
Despite the fact you left me alone

920
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:34,218
I'm in my feelings, like rain fall on the ground

921
00:49:34,218 --> 00:49:37,718
They're soaking through the sheets and drenching every single inch of me

922
00:49:37,718 --> 00:49:40,718
I'm in my feelings, it's falling all around

923
00:49:40,718 --> 00:49:44,718
Inside this never-ending downpour there's no escape to oh far

924
00:49:45,718 --> 00:49:47,718
Who you're seeing

925
00:49:49,218 --> 00:49:51,718
What you're doing

926
00:49:53,218 --> 00:49:55,218
Where you're going

927
00:49:55,218 --> 00:49:58,218
I don't want to know

928
00:49:58,718 --> 00:50:02,218
Why you're coming back, I don't...

929
00:50:02,218 --> 00:50:04,718
Don't need you to call me

930
00:50:04,718 --> 00:50:06,218
Don't need you to love me

931
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:07,436
I don't want your weak explanation

932
00:50:07,436 --> 00:50:11,236
Know that I never met your expectations

933
00:50:11,236 --> 00:50:14,636
Now I just want you out of my head

934
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,636
Want to move along, carry on

935
00:50:16,636 --> 00:50:20,436
Hold my head high, but

936
00:50:20,436 --> 00:50:22,936
I'm in my feelings, feelings

937
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:25,536
Like raindrops on the ground

938
00:50:25,536 --> 00:50:27,136
They're soaking through the sheets

939
00:50:27,136 --> 00:50:29,336
And drenching every single inch of me

940
00:50:29,336 --> 00:50:31,836
I'm in my feelings, feelings

941
00:50:31,836 --> 00:50:34,236
It's falling all around

942
00:50:34,236 --> 00:50:36,336
But at the end of this downpour

943
00:50:36,336 --> 00:50:39,336
Is a highway waitin' for

944
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,936
I'm in my feelings, feelings

945
00:50:43,636 --> 00:50:46,136
I'm in my feelings, feelings, ooh

946
00:50:47,436 --> 00:50:50,036
I'm in my feelings, feelings

947
00:50:50,036 --> 00:50:52,136
At the end of this downpour

948
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:54,036
Is a rainbow I had prayed for

949
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:03,236
No way, so way, been clawed.

950
00:52:03,236 --> 00:52:06,736
That wasn't enough, was it, Jailbirds? Please!

951
00:52:06,736 --> 00:52:10,736
Jailbirds, do you know what time it is? Ten...

952
00:52:10,736 --> 00:52:12,536
Encore!

953
00:52:13,536 --> 00:52:14,636
Encore!

954
00:52:15,636 --> 00:52:16,636
Encore!

955
00:52:17,836 --> 00:52:18,736
Encore!

956
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:20,936
Encore!

957
00:52:21,936 --> 00:52:22,936
Encore!

958
00:52:24,036 --> 00:52:25,036
Encore!

959
00:52:26,136 --> 00:52:27,136
Encore!

960
00:52:27,136 --> 00:52:28,136
Encore!

961
00:52:28,136 --> 00:52:30,536
Encore!

962
00:52:31,936 --> 00:52:34,236
Oh, Jailbird!

963
00:52:34,236 --> 00:52:37,036
You guys wanted one more song?

964
00:52:37,036 --> 00:52:41,136
Ah, I see. Come here, come here! Ah!

965
00:52:41,136 --> 00:52:46,036
Well, I suppose if it's you guys asking,
then how can I resist?

966
00:52:46,036 --> 00:52:50,336
But, you know, I am going to
perform one more song for you.

967
00:52:50,336 --> 00:52:52,936
I think it's going to be super hype.

968
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:57,336
But before that, I have some
important things to tell you about.

969
00:52:57,336 --> 00:53:00,736
But first, ah, reminiscing already.

970
00:53:00,736 --> 00:53:02,636
Today was so much fun.

971
00:53:02,636 --> 00:53:06,036
I had such a good time cooking with Lulu

972
00:53:06,036 --> 00:53:08,536
and Takanashi Kiara-senpai.

973
00:53:08,536 --> 00:53:10,836
The Nikujaga was so delicious.

974
00:53:10,836 --> 00:53:15,636
Like honestly, of everything,
I think that was the most delicious thing.

975
00:53:15,636 --> 00:53:20,436
And I really did fulfill my title
as the Demon of Soup,

976
00:53:20,436 --> 00:53:24,536
because I made a really weird, mind you, soup.

977
00:53:24,536 --> 00:53:25,936
But it was good!

978
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:29,536
And then getting to read that really silly script

979
00:53:29,536 --> 00:53:32,636
with Marine and Calli, it was so much fun.

980
00:53:32,636 --> 00:53:35,536
The banana... banana...

981
00:53:35,536 --> 00:53:38,536
Oh my god, Marine is a natural comedian,

982
00:53:38,536 --> 00:53:41,436
obviously, because she's in Hololive.

983
00:53:41,436 --> 00:53:43,136
We're all comedians.

984
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:47,136
And I've had so much fun performing for you guys.

985
00:53:47,136 --> 00:53:49,836
If you enjoyed that last song, "In My Feelings,"

986
00:53:49,836 --> 00:53:51,436
I hope you did.

987
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:54,536
I was so happy to finally get to
share that with you guys.

988
00:53:54,536 --> 00:53:57,336
So I hope you've enjoyed everything
that I've given you so far.

989
00:53:57,336 --> 00:54:00,536
But without further ado,
I do have some goods for you,

990
00:54:00,536 --> 00:54:02,636
or a good for you. So let's go ahead
and take a look.

991
00:54:02,636 --> 00:54:04,336
Nerissa Ravencroft
Paper Knife

992
00:54:02,936 --> 00:54:04,936
Ah, here it is!

993
00:54:04,936 --> 00:54:08,636
So this is based off of my tuning fork,
which some of you may know,

994
00:54:08,636 --> 00:54:13,136
some of you may not know, is also
actually a microphone.

995
00:54:13,136 --> 00:54:17,536
But as you can see, this is a paper knife,
or a paper cutter.

996
00:54:17,536 --> 00:54:19,436
Do you have mail that has been,

997
00:54:19,436 --> 00:54:22,536
you know, really annoying you as you try to open it?

998
00:54:22,536 --> 00:54:24,736
You're like, "Ah, I can't get it!"

999
00:54:24,736 --> 00:54:27,336
Well, this will solve that.

1000
00:54:27,336 --> 00:54:30,536
Do you have a problem and you just like cutting paper?

1001
00:54:30,536 --> 00:54:32,436
This will help you too.

1002
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:35,936
Any of your paper cutting needs, this will help you.

1003
00:54:35,936 --> 00:54:39,536
Again, it's pretty much a replica of my weapon.

1004
00:54:39,536 --> 00:54:41,536
So if you think that's cool, if you want it,

1005
00:54:41,536 --> 00:54:43,836
it also comes in a cool box.

1006
00:54:43,836 --> 00:54:46,536
So please do consider picking it up.

1007
00:54:46,536 --> 00:54:48,636
My paper knife. Hehe.

1008
00:54:48,636 --> 00:54:51,436
So also, as I already mentioned before,

1009
00:54:51,436 --> 00:54:54,436
my EP just came out. It's already
been out for a little bit now.

1010
00:54:54,436 --> 00:54:57,636
But if you haven't heard it, there's three new songs.

1011
00:54:57,636 --> 00:55:00,736
It also includes a fourth, "Say My Name,"

1012
00:55:00,736 --> 00:55:02,636
which of course is already a fan favorite.

1013
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:05,336
But if you haven't already, it's
available on streaming services,

1014
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:06,136
it's available on YouTube. Please...

1015
00:55:06,154 --> 00:55:07,454
Please go give it a listen.

1016
00:55:07,454 --> 00:55:11,254
I worked so hard on it and I'm so proud
of all the songs.

1017
00:55:11,254 --> 00:55:14,954
Of course you heard the titular track
"In My Feelings".

1018
00:55:14,954 --> 00:55:19,254
I, you know, that one, I poured a lot of myself into.

1019
00:55:19,254 --> 00:55:21,054
I think it's just so fantastic.

1020
00:55:21,054 --> 00:55:24,554
But there's two other songs that you have
yet to hear today.

1021
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:27,954
So if you haven't already,
please go ahead and check it out.

1022
00:55:27,954 --> 00:55:31,654
Again, so proud of it and I'm hoping...

1023
00:55:31,654 --> 00:55:34,254
...all of them can get to a million listens
on Spotify.

1024
00:55:34,254 --> 00:55:37,354
So please listen to them lots and lots and lots!

1025
00:55:37,354 --> 00:55:41,954
But without further ado, you guys did call me
on here for an encore.

1026
00:55:41,954 --> 00:55:44,854
So I guess I'll stop shilling and I'll start singing.

1027
00:55:44,854 --> 00:55:48,654
So without further ado, please listen to
"Sweetest Scarlet".

1028
00:55:55,954 --> 00:56:00,754
My sweetest scarlet, my sweetest scarlet

1029
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:09,654
My sweetest scarlet, my sweetest scarlet

1030
00:56:13,554 --> 00:56:16,654
Looking to find the words to tell you

1031
00:56:16,654 --> 00:56:20,454
This feeling's brand new, trying to make do

1032
00:56:21,654 --> 00:56:25,154
Still I can feel my heart is driving

1033
00:56:25,154 --> 00:56:29,154
You've got me lost inside the groove,
wishing you would make a move

1034
00:56:29,154 --> 00:56:32,654
Cause I can't even look away

1035
00:56:32,654 --> 00:56:36,454
Your eyes are shining, still there's something
that you're hiding

1036
00:56:36,454 --> 00:56:40,154
Won't you tell me with the warmth of your lips

1037
00:56:40,154 --> 00:56:44,354
How you found me was lonely,
then you filled my heart up wholly

1038
00:56:44,354 --> 00:56:49,154
Let me know, let me know, let me know
what keeps you smiling by my side

1039
00:56:49,154 --> 00:56:53,554
If above or below me,
baby you're my one and only

1040
00:56:53,554 --> 00:56:58,654
Let me show, let me show, let me show you
I can love you through the night, yeah

1041
00:56:58,654 --> 00:57:02,654
My sweetest scarlet, my sweetest scarlet

1042
00:57:02,654 --> 00:57:04,854
Baby, you're on my mind all of the time

1043
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:07,454
Yeah, you plus me, I can get behind

1044
00:57:07,454 --> 00:57:11,254
My sweetest scarlet, my sweetest scarlet

1045
00:57:11,254 --> 00:57:13,954
Truly you got my heart right from the start

1046
00:57:13,954 --> 00:57:17,454
You fill me with your love

1047
00:57:18,454 --> 00:57:22,254
Standing with you beneath the moonlight,
you dazzle though it's midnight

1048
00:57:22,254 --> 00:57:27,154
You shine so bright, what is happening?

1049
00:57:27,154 --> 00:57:30,854
Longing to have you through the cold night

1050
00:57:30,854 --> 00:57:36,154
Now I'm a victim to your charms,
stop delaying hold me close and warm

1051
00:57:36,154 --> 00:57:38,354
We'll melt into each other's arms

1052
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:41,954
Don't need permission, my decision's
already made clear

1053
00:57:41,954 --> 00:57:45,254
You could feel it from the moment we kissed

1054
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:48,954
How you found me was lonely,
then you filled my heart up wholly

1055
00:57:48,954 --> 00:57:53,454
Let me know, let me know, let me know
what keeps you smiling by my side

1056
00:57:53,454 --> 00:57:58,354
If above or below me,
baby you're my one and only

1057
00:57:58,354 --> 00:58:02,954
Let me show, let me show, let me show you
I can love you through the night, yeah

1058
00:58:02,954 --> 00:58:06,754
My sweetest scarlet, my sweetest scarlet
