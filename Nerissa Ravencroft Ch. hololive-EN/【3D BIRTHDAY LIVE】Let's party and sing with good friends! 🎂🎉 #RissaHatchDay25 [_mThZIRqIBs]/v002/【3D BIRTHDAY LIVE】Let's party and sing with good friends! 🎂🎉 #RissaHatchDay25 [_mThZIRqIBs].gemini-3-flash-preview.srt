Birthday Bedroom Break-In

00:00:00,000 --> 00:04:26,500
Now Loading

4
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:25,314
Nerissa...

5
00:05:26,597 --> 00:05:28,673
When was the last time we saw her?

6
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:32,048
<translator's note: She hasn't left her room in two weeks>

7
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:32,195
She hasn't left her room in two weeks!

8
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:35,360
Don't say this...

9
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:37,940
She doesn't love us anymore!

10
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:43,392
GATHER, my friends.

11
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,069
Is that... Jailboss?

12
00:05:45,276 --> 00:05:46,562
Jailboss?

13
00:05:45,276 --> 00:05:46,562
JAILBOSS?

14
00:05:45,276 --> 00:05:46,562
Jailboss (jailboss)

15
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,925
Tonight, we infiltrate her bedroom.

16
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,093
Follow me.

17
00:05:50,193 --> 00:05:53,077
I know a secret passage.

18
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:09,104
Nerissa! Nerissa!

19
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:14,660
How DARE you enter my room?

20
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:16,197
OUTSIDE!

21
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:19,571
Don't mess with a girl's sleepover!

22
00:06:21,894 --> 00:06:23,059
BEGONE!

23
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:07,548
ANEMONE

00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:07,548
Lyrics, Music, Arrangement: ゆよゆっぺ
Lyrics, Music, Arrangement: Yuyoyuppe

25
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:11,248
運命はもろく
Fate is fragile,

26
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:13,648
愚かな結末
a foolish conclusion.

27
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:16,048
貼り付けにされた
The heart that was

28
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:18,598
心は泣いてる
crucified is crying.

29
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:23,598
両手から零れ落ちる雫が
The droplets spilling from both hands

30
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:28,998
貴方には見えていないのでしょう？
likely are not visible to you, are they?

31
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:33,598
嗚呼 ここまで
Ah, this far...

32
00:07:33,648 --> 00:07:38,598
悲しい声に 言葉に 覆われて
...covered in sad voices and words.

33
00:07:38,648 --> 00:07:43,598
俯いたまま 微笑む赤い花
Looking down, a red flower smiles.

34
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:48,598
深く汚れた 痛みが贖罪なら
If the deeply stained pain is atonement...

35
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:53,648
解り合えない ずっとこのまま
...we can't understand each other, forever like this.

36
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:07,248
変わらない運命
Unchanging fate,

37
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:09,648
周期は不条理
the cycle is absurd.

38
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,048
吐き出させられて
Forced to spit it out,

39
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:14,598
感覚の違い
the difference in sensation.

40
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:19,598
在り触れた刃を振りかざす
Brandishing a commonplace blade,

41
00:08:19,648 --> 00:08:24,098
貴方には見えていないのでしょう？
likely not visible to you, are they?

42
00:08:25,648 --> 00:08:29,648
嗚呼 消えない傷跡
Ah, scars that won't fade...

43
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:44,598
風も吹く夜に 知ってしまう花の色を
On a night the wind blows, I see the flower's color

44
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:49,098
貴方は知ることも きっと無いのですよ
which you surely will never come to know.

45
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:55,598
底の底まで 堕ちたら黒い景色
If you fall to the very bottom, a black landscape.

46
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:59,648
俯いたまま 泣いてた赤い花
Looking down, a red flower was crying.

47
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:05,598
朽ちていく心の中 混ざってる
Mixed within the decaying heart,

48
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:11,648
有りの侭 生きていたいと
wanting to live just as I am.

49
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:17,598
悲しい声に 言葉に 覆われて
Covered in sad voices and words,

50
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:22,598
俯いたまま 散り行く果てまで
looking down, until the end of scattering.

51
00:09:23,098 --> 00:09:27,598
深く笑う 痛みが消えなくとも
Laughing deeply, even if the pain doesn't fade,

52
00:09:27,648 --> 00:09:31,648
足掻き続けよう 何度だって
let's keep struggling, over and over.

53
00:09:32,598 --> 00:09:40,098
想い 想いに 手を伸ばして
Reaching out to our various thoughts and feelings.

54
00:10:06,903 --> 00:10:07,753
Little darling!

55
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:10,403
My love, where are you?

56
00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:14,003
Hello? Are you over here?

57
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:17,253
Oh, there you are!

58
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:18,653
My darling!

59
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:22,803
Oh, you look so cute laying on my bed like that!

60
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:25,553
Isn't he just adorable?

61
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:27,503
I just want to squeeze him...

62
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:29,503
...but I'll leave him be for the time being.

63
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:33,203
Jailbirds, I have to welcome you...

64
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:36,903
...to my room as this is a very, very special day.

65
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,303
Do you know? Do you remember?

66
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:42,003
That today is my birthday!

67
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:43,703
In case you don't know me,

68
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:45,003
let me quick introduce myself.

69
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:48,003
Hiya darlings! This is Hololive English Advent's

70
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:51,003
devilish diva, the one, the only,

71
00:10:51,053 --> 00:10:53,303
Nerissa Ravencroft!

72
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,303
And I'm so happy to have you in here

73
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:57,803
for my room debut!

74
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:02,003
Being able to celebrate with you guys is so amazing,

75
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:04,003
but I thought it would be more fun

76
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:06,103
if I had some friends with me!

77
00:11:06,153 --> 00:11:09,003
So, I've invited some very special people today.

78
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:11,003
Would you guys please come on in?

79
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:15,503
Yay! Happy Birthday! Woohoo!

80
00:11:15,553 --> 00:11:18,003
What's up you party animals?! We're in the room!

81
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:24,003
Whoa! Happy Birthday Nerissa!

82
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:30,503
And we're here today to celebrate Nerissa! Yeah!

83
00:11:30,553 --> 00:11:32,003
Happy Birthday!

84
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:33,903
Thank you all for coming!

85
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:35,503
No, you're here for me, right?

86
00:11:35,553 --> 00:11:36,503
Right, for me!

87
00:11:36,553 --> 00:11:38,503
Wait, wait, here for your bed!

88
00:11:38,553 --> 00:11:42,003
Uh, yes! What do you guys think, by the way?

89
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:43,703
It looks like you!

90
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:47,003
I'm glad! I want to show off some details

91
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:50,503
because this is... I know you guys have been here before,

92
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:53,503
but this is the Jailbirds' first ever time seeing my room.

93
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:56,803
So, let me go ahead and point out some of the details.

94
00:11:57,053 --> 00:11:59,503
First, because everyone's so interested in it,

95
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,003
I want to highlight the bed area.

96
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:05,503
In this area, we have a lot of my personal plushies...

97
00:12:05,553 --> 00:12:06,303
Cat!

98
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:07,803
...and my cat.

99
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:12,003
He does have another cat bed, but he likes to sleep there.

100
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:15,503
It's also very princess-y, right? Just like me, right?

101
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:16,703
Baby girl coded.

102
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:19,503
Baby girl coded! I also have a beautiful painting

103
00:12:19,553 --> 00:12:21,003
right above my bed.

104
00:12:21,353 --> 00:12:24,003
Wow! And I see something else there.

105
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:25,303
Is that a Jailbird?

106
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:26,403
No, no way!

107
00:12:26,553 --> 00:12:27,503
What? Huh?

108
00:12:27,553 --> 00:12:28,503
That's not a Jailbird, right?

109
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:29,503
Who knows?

110
00:12:29,553 --> 00:12:31,503
Then behind me, over behind FuwaMoko,

111
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:33,803
there is this beautiful vanity area.

112
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:34,503
Yay!

113
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,303
It's my kind of... It makes me feel even more princess-y.

114
00:12:36,353 --> 00:12:38,903
You can see there's a bust of my head because—

115
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:41,503
Wow! You have a bust made of yourself!

116
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,703
It's important. It's important.

117
00:12:43,753 --> 00:12:46,003
I also have a Renaissance painting

118
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:48,003
scattered throughout the room, too.

119
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:49,303
You might notice them.

120
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,003
I have little Advent references.

121
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:52,003
Oh! I see it!

122
00:12:52,153 --> 00:12:53,803
There's a Pero hiding!

123
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:55,303
Some are over here.

124
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:59,503
Up there! I have a Novelite.

125
00:13:00,053 --> 00:13:02,803
And then over here, over by the vanity area,

126
00:13:02,853 --> 00:13:04,303
there's a little Geo.

127
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:06,803
Yay! So cute!

128
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,003
Lots of little Advent references all around

129
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:11,503
for you to enjoy.

130
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:15,003
So... yeah! That's it! That's awesome, right?

131
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:17,803
That's it? All right, time to leave!

132
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:20,003
Whoa! Well, thanks for having us!

133
00:13:20,053 --> 00:13:22,503
Thanks so much, we're leaving now.

134
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:23,303
Yeah! Bye!

135
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:25,703
You're leaving? What the—? You're not leaving!

136
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:26,803
I saw your cat.

137
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:29,303
I mean, okay! So, are you guys gonna have us

138
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:30,503
do anything then while we're here?

139
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:34,003
Well, I've prepared a very special game today, actually.

140
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:37,503
I think you guys are gonna have a lot of fun.

141
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:42,003
So, it's something a little out of the ordinary.

142
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:42,803
I'll protect you!

143
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:47,003
Today, you must treat me like your princesses...

144
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:50,803
Ah! Like your princess, actually.

145
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:52,803
No, I'm your princess!

146
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:53,803
No, okay! You're the princess!

147
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:58,003
And you are my prince! So, it's going to be a blind date.

148
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:02,003
You have to make my heart flutter a lot

149
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:04,803
and make me feel amazing on my birthday.

150
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:07,503
I guess it sounds like fun then!

151
00:14:07,853 --> 00:14:10,003
I'm the one being rizz'd in this game.

152
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:13,003
I'm excited to see your unexpected sides.

153
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,503
So, I need to prep everything in my room,

154
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:17,303
so I need you all to get over there!

155
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:20,503
Get! No, no, no, just over there!

156
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:22,303
I'm gonna set up everything, okay?

157
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:23,303
In the corner!

158
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:25,003
Okay, I'm gonna set up.

159
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:52,003
Okay, what do you guys think?

160
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:54,503
Whoa! A chair!

161
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:57,003
It exists!

162
00:14:57,053 --> 00:14:59,903
It kind of doesn't match the room's theme though, no?

163
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:01,577
It's fine. I'm going to be sitting...

164
00:15:01,577 --> 00:15:03,377
...in this chair right here...

165
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:05,144
...and I'm going to put on a blindfold, too.

166
00:15:05,144 --> 00:15:07,044
Oh! Wait! Why?

167
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:09,044
Why? Why?

168
00:15:09,044 --> 00:15:11,044
Don't worry, don't worry. It's Piyanas.

169
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:15,477
Piyanas! Piyanas! Piyanas! Piyanas!

170
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:17,610
You guys can relax, okay? Relax.

171
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,010
And come close to me. You're so far away.

172
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,044
Oh!

173
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:24,244
So, on this projector here, there's going to be prompts...

174
00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:27,044
...with various questions and situations will appear.

175
00:15:27,044 --> 00:15:29,510
So, you all have to answer them one by one.

176
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,444
Your voices are going to be altered with a voice changer.

177
00:15:32,444 --> 00:15:34,444
Oh! What? Is it going to be cute?

178
00:15:34,444 --> 00:15:37,244
Yeah! But I'm not going to be able to know who's talking.

179
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:39,710
So, based on that, I won't have any...

180
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,910
...preconceptions about anyone...

181
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,910
...because it'll just be based on your rizz alone.

182
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,877
So feel free to be extra romantic, okay?

183
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:53,010
What?! Extra romantic? What's that, Shiori?

184
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,944
Don't worry about it!

185
00:15:54,944 --> 00:15:57,110
We'll do our best to be romantic then, huh?!

186
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,344
Yeah! Oh!

187
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:01,877
Let's start!

188
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,010
The name of the game is...

189
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,677
Cellmate's in Love!

190
00:16:05,677 --> 00:16:09,044
Yeah!

191
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:13,544
Cellmate's in Love

192
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,677
The questions for everyone will be displayed on the projector screen...

193
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:14,844
...so please read them carefully.

194
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:17,877
But, I must put my blindfold on now.

195
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:21,544
Oh! Okay!

196
00:16:22,044 --> 00:16:24,244
Okay, so I guess she won't know who's answering.

197
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:28,010
So, the person should move quietly so she doesn't know the order.

198
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,444
Yeah! And plus we have a voice changer.

199
00:16:30,444 --> 00:16:33,710
Yeah! Hmm...

200
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:36,977
Okay, well, we should probably line up now, huh?

201
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:39,377
Okay... who wants to go first?

202
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:41,910
I don't know...

203
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,744
How about... I think you should go first.

204
00:16:44,744 --> 00:16:47,877
Okay. We'll continue answering in this order then.

205
00:16:47,877 --> 00:16:50,544
Yeah! Okay!

206
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:57,044
Now, give us the first question!

207
00:16:58,744 --> 00:17:00,544
First Date!

208
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:03,044
Rissa... it's been over two years since Rissa and I became friends...

209
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:06,044
...but I think it's time to take our relationship beyond friendship!

210
00:17:06,044 --> 00:17:09,044
Whoa!

211
00:17:13,344 --> 00:17:17,344
I'm scared I might ruin things, but I also really want to tell her how I feel!

212
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:21,044
So, everyone, gather your courage...

213
00:17:21,044 --> 00:17:24,144
...and finally decide to ask Nerissa out on a date!

214
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:28,144
What would you say to her, and where would you like to go for your first date?

215
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:31,377
Try to ask her smoothly!

216
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:32,944
That was a lot!

217
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:39,710
Okay, so it's not just a hypothetical situation, right?

218
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,544
That's a lot of points, isn't it?

219
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:45,910
We all have to figure out how to ask her out.

220
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:54,544
How Nerissa hears it / Nerissaにはこう聞こえています

221
00:18:00,544 --> 00:18:02,544
Okay, I'm here. Okay...

222
00:18:08,544 --> 00:18:10,544
Nerissa...

223
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:12,544
You know, I've been thinking...

224
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,877
You're really important to me...

225
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:22,544
...and I'd like to go out somewhere special together.

226
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:26,544
And I... when we have some time, just the two of us, you know?

227
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:32,544
So, I was thinking, maybe we could go to that cafe...

228
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:36,544
...that you said you liked a few months ago? Oh, your favorite, right?

229
00:18:36,544 --> 00:18:40,544
We could go there, and have a nice evening.

230
00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:44,544
And then maybe, you know, once our tummies are all full...

231
00:18:44,544 --> 00:18:47,877
...then we can go on a bit of a stroll.

232
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:51,877
Enjoy, you know, the city lights... maybe the water, huh?

233
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:53,544
Would you like that?

234
00:18:53,544 --> 00:18:58,844
I would like that! That sounds so sweet!

235
00:18:58,844 --> 00:19:01,210
Well then, it's a date. Okay?

236
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,544
Let's do it! So romantic!

237
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:07,544
Okay, I did my best!

238
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:09,544
You did great! Yeah!

239
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:12,544
Okay, good job, good job!

240
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:18,544
I'll go, I'll just go! Do your best, Biboo!

241
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:22,544
Yeah! Show her what you're made of!

242
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:25,544
Hey, can we lower the mic a little bit for me?

243
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:28,544
I don't think you need that. No, you're fine.

244
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:31,544
Wait, this is kind of mean, isn't it? What? What?

245
00:19:31,544 --> 00:19:35,544
Deal with it! It's your date! Okay, I'm ready, I'm ready!

246
00:19:41,544 --> 00:19:43,544
Hey, Nerissa...

247
00:19:43,544 --> 00:19:46,544
You and me... movies tonight.

248
00:19:46,544 --> 00:19:48,877
Come or don't. But if you don't...

249
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:51,877
...you're going to miss out on so much, baby.

250
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:54,877
You know what we're going to do at the movies?

251
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:58,210
We're going to pick the scariest movie ever!

252
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,544
And then...

253
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:05,732
I...

254
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:06,932
I am going to be such a bleeping wimp.

255
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:08,932
I'm going to cry.

256
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:12,932
I'm going to cringe at the jump scares.

257
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:14,932
I'm going to be so bleeping scared, you're going to have to comfort me.

258
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:19,432
And then you're going to have to put your arm around my shoulder and be like, "It's okay, sweetie."

259
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:20,932
You'll be fine.

260
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:22,932
And then I'm going to... I'm going to nuzzle myself into your chest.

261
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:26,432
Yeah, while you comfort me. And we're going to bond over fear.

262
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:28,432
And it's going to be the most amazing thing ever.

263
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:29,432
Wait, what?

264
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:31,432
Oh my gosh, that sounds...

265
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:34,432
Come to the movies with me, or not. It doesn't matter.

266
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:35,932
That sounds so enthralling.

267
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:37,432
Whoa! I'm kind of interested.

268
00:20:37,432 --> 00:20:38,932
Sounds like a booty call.

269
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:40,932
But I'm a little scared, too.

270
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:43,432
I feel like I'm going to have to be the one comforting you.

271
00:20:43,432 --> 00:20:44,932
I don't know how I feel about that.

272
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:45,432
That's the point.

273
00:20:45,432 --> 00:20:45,932
Yeah, that's the point.

274
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:48,932
Well, that's a good... Okay, let's move on to the next person then, how about?

275
00:20:48,932 --> 00:20:50,932
That was a good job.

276
00:20:50,932 --> 00:20:52,432
Yeah, nice try.

277
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:53,932
Nice try, Koseki.

278
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:55,432
Who's next?

279
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:57,432
Then my turn! My turn!

280
00:20:57,432 --> 00:21:00,932
After that you have to show off. Yeah.

281
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:02,932
Get going! Go, go!

282
00:21:02,932 --> 00:21:04,932
All right, I'm waiting.

283
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,432
That was pretty good. Impressive.

284
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:12,432
First Date!

285
00:21:13,432 --> 00:21:17,432
Nerissa... well, you know...

286
00:21:17,432 --> 00:21:22,432
We've been close for a little while now.

287
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:26,432
We've gone to far-off places, right?

288
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:31,932
But we've never really been able to hang out, just the two of us, you know?

289
00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:35,432
So, I think I'd really like it if it was just you and myself.

290
00:21:35,432 --> 00:21:39,432
That's what I was thinking.

291
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:44,432
How Nerissa hears it / Nerissaにはこう聞こえています

292
00:21:42,432 --> 00:21:46,932
Maybe we could go get a massage together?

293
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:51,432
And then afterwards, once we feel so much more relaxed and free...

294
00:21:54,432 --> 00:21:59,432
We could go to a café, a café that's very special to me.

295
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:05,432
Because I know you're a little into that too.

296
00:22:05,432 --> 00:22:09,432
And then we could just chat and...

297
00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:12,432
...more.

298
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,432
More? Oh!

299
00:22:14,432 --> 00:22:17,432
Oh, that sounds so fun too!

300
00:22:17,432 --> 00:22:21,432
You guys are really speaking to my heart here with these cafés and dates and stuff.

301
00:22:21,432 --> 00:22:24,432
I like it a lot.

302
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:27,432
I think we have one more contestant, so bachelor number four...

303
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:30,432
...will you please take the stage?

304
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,432
You bet so. Make it romantic.

305
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:34,432
Stomps angrily on the ground.

306
00:22:34,432 --> 00:22:36,432
I would go on a date with you.

307
00:22:36,432 --> 00:22:38,432
I- No thank you.

308
00:22:40,432 --> 00:22:44,432
My lady, tips fedora.

309
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:47,432
Pulls out ten million dollars in cash.

310
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:51,432
Waves it under your nose. This is all for you.

311
00:22:51,432 --> 00:22:54,432
And you know what? Not only that, but I have ten million roses in the ground here.

312
00:22:54,432 --> 00:22:56,432
Do they all don't die, just like my love for you.

313
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:59,432
How Nerissa hears it / Nerissaにはこう聞こえています

314
00:23:00,432 --> 00:23:02,432
That's how it's supposed to be.

315
00:23:02,432 --> 00:23:06,432
You are as beautiful as the moon, so bright, so elegant.

316
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:09,432
So in the night sky. I love seeing you at night, man.

317
00:23:09,432 --> 00:23:12,932
Sorry, what are we doing for this date?

318
00:23:12,932 --> 00:23:14,932
Oh sorry, I completely forgot about the date.

319
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:18,432
Go on a date with me though!

320
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:21,432
Okay, you've convinced me.

321
00:23:21,432 --> 00:23:25,432
I think all of you have successfully managed to rizz me on a date.

322
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:28,432
So there's our first question.

323
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:30,932
Yay! Good job!

324
00:23:30,932 --> 00:23:33,432
Come back, come back! Let me get my cash again.

325
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:42,432
I can't tell who my favorite is yet. I think we're going to need some more questions for me to be able to pick.

326
00:23:42,432 --> 00:23:43,432
More?

327
00:23:43,432 --> 00:23:44,432
All right.

328
00:23:44,432 --> 00:23:45,432
Let's do it.

329
00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:47,432
There's more! Yay!

330
00:23:48,432 --> 00:23:52,432
All right, well let's move on to the next question then!

331
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:56,432
First Date Surprise. You successfully asked Nerissa out, and she happily said yes!

332
00:23:56,432 --> 00:24:00,932
Since it's our first date, we want to make her feel special and happy, right?

333
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:02,432
Of course!

334
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:06,432
Yeah, what kind of surprise do we have in store for our first date?

335
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:09,432
A surprise! Yeah, a surprise!

336
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:12,932
I'm looking forward to it.

337
00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:18,932
Now the question is, are we going to continue the story of our first date?

338
00:24:18,932 --> 00:24:22,432
Yeah! Maybe! Let's do that! Me too! Okay!

339
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:26,432
Okay, blindfold back on!

340
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:31,932
Again? Yay! Oh!

341
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:34,432
All right, I'm ready to be rizzed.

342
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:37,432
All right, well we're ready to rizz you.

343
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:40,432
Let's go in order of rizz then.

344
00:24:40,432 --> 00:24:43,432
Okay, that means here I go!

345
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:46,432
You're so brave!

346
00:24:51,432 --> 00:24:57,432
So then, during our date, while we're walking along the water at night with all the city lights around us...

347
00:24:57,432 --> 00:25:02,432
Suddenly... you lose sight of me. What?

348
00:25:04,473 --> 00:25:05,973
Where could she be, huh?

349
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:09,273
You feel a bit panicked,

350
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:12,373
and then suddenly you see a bunch of mascot characters.

351
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:17,073
And they're doing a little bit of a dance,

352
00:25:17,073 --> 00:25:18,973
like... ah, oh, ah, oh.

353
00:25:19,973 --> 00:25:23,273
And then, all of a sudden, one of them goes... Wha!

354
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:26,373
And out comes... me!

355
00:25:26,973 --> 00:25:29,673
A little bit of a surprise, and I have roses.

356
00:25:31,273 --> 00:25:33,973
And I say, "You're the character of my life."

357
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:35,773
"For you."

358
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:39,273
So cute!

359
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,073
Wow, that's so romantic,

360
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,773
bachelor number one.

361
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:46,373
Thank you.

362
00:25:46,373 --> 00:25:47,473
Romance, yeah.

363
00:25:52,673 --> 00:25:53,973
All right.

364
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:55,373
Next is...

365
00:25:55,373 --> 00:25:56,473
Bijou!

366
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,273
Go on, my little rizz champion.

367
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,373
Oh, hi girls, yeah.

368
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:02,373
Steal the mic... okay, well, whatever.

369
00:26:07,073 --> 00:26:09,973
All right, Nerissa, after our date, you know,

370
00:26:10,173 --> 00:26:13,473
um, you have to take me home because...

371
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:16,273
I spilled my drink all over myself

372
00:26:16,273 --> 00:26:19,673
from being scared because you were comforting me, right?

373
00:26:19,973 --> 00:26:23,273
And so afterwards, I take you home to my place.

374
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:26,373
And you know what we're going to do?

375
00:26:26,373 --> 00:26:29,373
We open the door and there's trash everywhere.

376
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:31,973
And that is my surprise,

377
00:26:31,973 --> 00:26:35,373
because I know everything about you and I know that you love cleaning.

378
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:37,973
So, surprise!

379
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:40,573
My room is dirty and you have to clean it.

380
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:42,473
And you love that so much.

381
00:26:42,473 --> 00:26:44,073
And that's so romantic for me.

382
00:26:44,073 --> 00:26:46,873
I'm like, "Yeah, woman, clean my house."

383
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:48,873
And I'll let you...

384
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,173
I'll let you clean my house and you feel so strong,

385
00:26:51,173 --> 00:26:52,373
you know?

386
00:26:53,073 --> 00:26:55,073
You know, I do love to clean,

387
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:57,173
especially for my friends.

388
00:26:57,673 --> 00:27:00,373
However, I think if I was on a romantic date,

389
00:27:00,373 --> 00:27:02,173
it would not be at the top of my list.

390
00:27:02,373 --> 00:27:05,973
But in the trash, there's like treasures for you

391
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:08,173
that I put in the trash, like flowers.

392
00:27:08,673 --> 00:27:10,973
There's flowers in there, you'll have to...

393
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:12,973
you'll have to dig for it.

394
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:16,473
I think I'd be turned off by that.

395
00:27:16,473 --> 00:27:18,473
I feel like when I found them, I might be like,

396
00:27:18,473 --> 00:27:20,673
"Oh, that's cute," but I might be a little...

397
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,273
You did your best, so let's move on to the next one, how about that?

398
00:27:23,973 --> 00:27:25,273
No one understands me.

399
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:27,373
That's real romance.

400
00:27:30,373 --> 00:27:31,373
Okay, who's next?

401
00:27:31,373 --> 00:27:32,673
Did you like it?

402
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:33,973
Good job.

403
00:27:34,073 --> 00:27:36,273
I'm going to do my best!

404
00:27:40,573 --> 00:27:41,673
Whoa!

405
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:44,673
You know, here at this cafe...

406
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,173
I guess you're really excited for the cakes

407
00:27:49,173 --> 00:27:50,673
that we ordered, right?

408
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,173
And, well...

409
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:55,373
I wanted to surprise you,

410
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:59,073
and I know there's one thing that you love very much.

411
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:01,673
So...

412
00:28:02,373 --> 00:28:03,473
Nerissa...

413
00:28:03,673 --> 00:28:05,973
look into my eyes.

414
00:28:07,073 --> 00:28:08,773
You see this here?

415
00:28:08,973 --> 00:28:11,273
This is my smartphone.

416
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,673
SLAM! Slam on the table.

417
00:28:12,973 --> 00:28:16,173
Today, I'm giving you all my attention

418
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:19,373
because you're my princess.

419
00:28:20,973 --> 00:28:23,273
And today, it's just you and me.

420
00:28:24,973 --> 00:28:26,373
Whoa!

421
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,273
The rest of the world disappears

422
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,973
when we're together for you?

423
00:28:30,973 --> 00:28:33,973
That's such a good surprise.

424
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:36,173
I love it so far, bachelor number three.

425
00:28:37,073 --> 00:28:39,173
All right, let's hear the last bachelor, shall we?

426
00:28:39,373 --> 00:28:40,373
That was a good one.

427
00:28:40,373 --> 00:28:41,273
Yeah.

428
00:28:41,273 --> 00:28:42,073
Good job.

429
00:28:42,073 --> 00:28:42,973
Thank you.

430
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,973
I'm sad, I'm sad.

431
00:28:45,973 --> 00:28:47,473
My lady,

432
00:28:47,473 --> 00:28:50,373
as we walk on the moon where our date takes place in,

433
00:28:50,973 --> 00:28:53,473
I reconstructed it from the ground up.

434
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:56,373
There is an amusement park in your honor,

435
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:59,073
in your name: Nerissa Ravenland.

436
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:06,173
And there are jailbirds as far as the eye can see.

437
00:29:07,973 --> 00:29:08,973
And you,

438
00:29:08,973 --> 00:29:11,973
each one serves you to the utmost ability they have.

439
00:29:11,973 --> 00:29:13,973
You can even step on them.

440
00:29:13,973 --> 00:29:16,473
That is my surprise: an entire army just for you.

441
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:18,073
A fat flock.

442
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:21,173
Oh my gosh, that is kind of romantic.

443
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:22,373
Yeah.

444
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:24,973
But I think they do that for me regardless.

445
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:26,273
I don't think I need someone to set that up.

446
00:29:26,273 --> 00:29:27,473
But they're moon birds.

447
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:29,373
They're moon jailbirds.

448
00:29:29,373 --> 00:29:30,373
It's like a whole different species.

449
00:29:30,373 --> 00:29:31,373
Are they like white colored too then?

450
00:29:31,373 --> 00:29:32,273
Yes.

451
00:29:32,273 --> 00:29:33,473
They're also maybe fatter.

452
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:36,273
Fat on my love for you.

453
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:37,473
What?

454
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:38,973
You feed them with your love?

455
00:29:38,973 --> 00:29:39,973
That's how they survive.

456
00:29:41,173 --> 00:29:43,273
Well, thank you, bachelor number four.

457
00:29:43,273 --> 00:29:44,273
No problem.

458
00:29:44,273 --> 00:29:45,673
That was awesome.

459
00:29:45,673 --> 00:29:47,473
These are all awesome dates.

460
00:29:47,973 --> 00:29:48,873
Even mine?

461
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:50,273
Well, it was a good attempt.

462
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:51,273
Good job.

463
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:52,173
Yeah!

464
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:56,373
Everyone did so well! Yes!

465
00:29:56,973 --> 00:29:59,073
Let's move on to the next question, shall we?

466
00:30:06,232 --> 00:30:07,099
Ah, but...

467
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:14,232
...even on this special date, you feel frustrated that your 'just friends' vibe has not gone away yet.

468
00:30:14,832 --> 00:30:19,132
Um, now you want Nerissa to see you more than a friend...

469
00:30:19,132 --> 00:30:23,965
...and you want her to think of you as like a more of like a romantic interest.

470
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,199
So it's time to make your move!

471
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,232
How are you going to do it? Say something to win her heart!

472
00:30:29,665 --> 00:30:32,299
Please do win my heart, Advent!

473
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:33,499
Please!

474
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:06,896
Cellmate's in Love / Heart-Stirring

475
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:07,996
Steve!

476
00:35:08,196 --> 00:35:09,362
Steve, William,

477
00:35:09,362 --> 00:35:10,996
Matilda and Steve.

478
00:35:10,996 --> 00:35:11,896
I'm always such a kidder.

479
00:35:15,462 --> 00:35:16,862
Nerissa, my dearest,

480
00:35:19,262 --> 00:35:21,762
I like you more than a friend.

481
00:35:25,362 --> 00:35:27,962
Even I don't know how you feel about me,

482
00:35:28,396 --> 00:35:30,329
and regardless of who you choose,

483
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,129
whatever makes you happy,

484
00:35:33,129 --> 00:35:36,162
I will honor it and I will hope

485
00:35:36,162 --> 00:35:39,096
that you will always be happy with that person,

486
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:41,229
whether it is the beautiful Matilda...

487
00:35:41,229 --> 00:35:44,162
the other people I've named and forgot their names.

488
00:35:44,162 --> 00:35:45,796
You're just so wonderful

489
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:47,096
and your smile is precious.

490
00:35:47,996 --> 00:35:49,796
Tips fedora.

491
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:52,296
Also I might win 10 million dollars of cash

492
00:35:52,296 --> 00:35:53,696
depending on how you answer.

493
00:35:54,229 --> 00:35:55,962
Oh my gosh! So sweet!

494
00:35:57,962 --> 00:36:00,529
That's so earnest too! Wait, I wasn't expecting

495
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:02,996
that from you, bachelor number four, Steve!

496
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:06,229
No one ever expects that with a person

497
00:36:06,229 --> 00:36:07,162
with 10 million dollars.

498
00:36:08,562 --> 00:36:10,996
Oh, how sweet! You guys all did so good!

499
00:36:10,996 --> 00:36:13,862
I feel my heart racing for sure.

500
00:36:14,462 --> 00:36:16,429
So, which one made your heart

501
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:17,962
skip a beat the most, huh?

502
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:21,429
Well, the honest answer of who

503
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,696
made my heart stop...

504
00:36:25,362 --> 00:36:27,329
would be bachelor number two.

505
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:33,362
But I don't... it's difficult to say.

506
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:38,296
Again, it's still hard to pick.

507
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,829
I think we have to ask a few more questions

508
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:42,929
before I can settle on one of you.

509
00:36:44,596 --> 00:36:47,029
Two more questions. So,

510
00:36:47,029 --> 00:36:48,396
shall we read off the next one?

511
00:36:48,396 --> 00:36:50,096
Okay, let's go to the fourth question then!

512
00:36:50,896 --> 00:36:51,896
Cellmate's in Love / Love Crisis

513
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:55,896
The sweetest days you longed for with Nerissa...

514
00:36:56,996 --> 00:36:59,862
It's been two years since you finally confessed

515
00:36:59,862 --> 00:37:01,662
your love. Two years.

516
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,229
And embraced something truly special

517
00:37:04,229 --> 00:37:05,862
between the two of you.

518
00:37:07,196 --> 00:37:10,829
Everything seemed perfect, like a dream

519
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:11,996
you never wanted to end.

520
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:17,129
But a tiny mistake on your part sparked

521
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:18,662
a huge fight between the two of you.

522
00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:22,062
With all your heart, apologize

523
00:37:22,062 --> 00:37:24,062
for the wrong you've done,

524
00:37:24,062 --> 00:37:26,929
and strive together to overcome this trial

525
00:37:26,929 --> 00:37:28,396
that threatens your love.

526
00:37:29,596 --> 00:37:31,662
So we've been dating for two years

527
00:37:31,662 --> 00:37:33,362
and you guys have upset me.

528
00:37:35,696 --> 00:37:38,296
So, won't you please apologize

529
00:37:38,296 --> 00:37:39,296
and make it all better?

530
00:37:40,096 --> 00:37:42,062
I'll put my blindfold back on,

531
00:37:42,062 --> 00:37:44,129
so make things right between us, okay, you four?

532
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:54,896
Alright, bachelor number one, it's your turn.

533
00:37:55,662 --> 00:37:57,196
Okay, here I go!

534
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:06,496
Nerissa...

535
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:08,062
How Nerissa hears it.

536
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:09,629
I'm sorry.

537
00:38:09,629 --> 00:38:12,529
I know I hurt you very deeply with all my...

538
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:19,029
Well, it wasn't meant to be like this but

539
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:21,196
ultimately it turned out this way.

540
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:23,796
My indecisiveness...

541
00:38:25,362 --> 00:38:27,929
My lack of action...

542
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:35,029
I know that you, the love of my life...

543
00:38:36,029 --> 00:38:37,829
I should've done it.

544
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:40,162
I should've already proposed to you.

545
00:38:41,229 --> 00:38:44,162
Already have made you mine long before, but...

546
00:38:45,362 --> 00:38:47,429
I'm sorry for hurting you this way.

547
00:38:48,462 --> 00:38:52,362
For hurting you at your core, in your heart so deeply.

548
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:55,096
Could you ever forgive me?

549
00:38:57,262 --> 00:38:59,229
What a cutie!

550
00:38:59,229 --> 00:39:02,462
Still bachelor number one, you managed

551
00:39:02,462 --> 00:39:03,862
to be so earnest and sweet.

552
00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:05,862
You're really reaching to my heart.

553
00:39:06,229 --> 00:39:08,829
Let's move on to bachelor number two

554
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:10,996
and see what sort of answer they're going to give.

555
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:23,962
Hey Nerissa. I know I was gaming with the boys

556
00:39:26,296 --> 00:39:29,129
and then you walked in and you wanted attention.

557
00:39:30,296 --> 00:39:33,362
And I was like, "5 minutes, I can't pause the game,

558
00:39:33,362 --> 00:39:35,496
it's an online game, Nerissa!"

559
00:39:36,962 --> 00:39:39,296
And then you went away crying.

560
00:39:40,229 --> 00:39:43,296
But after the gaming session, I was like, "Hmm,

561
00:39:43,296 --> 00:39:45,429
maybe I did do something wrong..."

562
00:39:46,729 --> 00:39:48,929
Maybe I should've invited her

563
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:50,096
to play game with me.

564
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,229
So I'm going to do something that I've never

565
00:39:53,229 --> 00:39:55,129
done ever once in my life...

566
00:39:55,962 --> 00:39:57,229
apologize.

567
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,496
Never apologized to anyone ever,

568
00:39:59,496 --> 00:40:02,162
and I'm going to apologize to you now, so listen.

569
00:40:04,144 --> 00:40:04,944
Sorry I guess.

570
00:40:06,344 --> 00:40:07,744
If you want to be my player 2,

571
00:40:07,744 --> 00:40:10,244
I'll play with you instead of the boys.

572
00:40:11,544 --> 00:40:12,444
Mwah! Come here baby girl.

573
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:13,344
Yeah.

574
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,644
That's... I think that's good, Bachelor Number 2.

575
00:40:16,044 --> 00:40:18,344
Let's move on to Bachelor Number 3.

576
00:40:18,344 --> 00:40:20,144
Oh yeah, she loved that.

577
00:40:22,844 --> 00:40:25,344
Alright, Bachelor Number 3 to the mic, please.

578
00:40:31,344 --> 00:40:32,644
Hey.

579
00:40:34,744 --> 00:40:39,344
I know things have been a little weird recently, huh?

580
00:40:43,044 --> 00:40:45,344
I wanted to say something.

581
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,144
Nerissa...

582
00:40:48,844 --> 00:40:50,544
...I'm sorry.

583
00:40:50,844 --> 00:40:56,844
I know, you know, maybe I was acting a little childish.

584
00:40:57,444 --> 00:40:59,844
I kept on saying things...

585
00:41:00,444 --> 00:41:01,844
...like you're stinky.

586
00:41:02,444 --> 00:41:03,344
Heh?

587
00:41:05,844 --> 00:41:08,844
You know, maybe you took that personally, but...

588
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:11,344
...it's just, I was teasing you.

589
00:41:11,644 --> 00:41:13,544
Because I love you!

590
00:41:13,544 --> 00:41:17,144
I love you, Nerissa Ravencroft!

591
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:18,844
I'm sorry.

592
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:24,044
And I just wanted to say is that... you're stinky.

593
00:41:24,644 --> 00:41:25,844
But...

594
00:41:26,844 --> 00:41:28,644
...I love it. I love your stink!

595
00:41:32,644 --> 00:41:34,344
That's enough!

596
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:37,744
Let's move to the last bachelor, Bachelor Number 4.

597
00:41:38,144 --> 00:41:39,544
That was pretty good.

598
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:43,344
What the heck? That was great! What a beautiful stench.

599
00:41:44,344 --> 00:41:46,344
Okay, last one.

600
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:51,944
Hey, Nerissa.

601
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:55,344
It's me, one of the boys.

602
00:41:57,344 --> 00:42:00,344
I just wanted to say I'm sorry that...

603
00:42:00,344 --> 00:42:04,144
...the other person and I were gaming instead of giving you attention.

604
00:42:04,344 --> 00:42:05,144
Hello?

605
00:42:06,344 --> 00:42:10,844
We were just having so much fun playing games together.

606
00:42:10,844 --> 00:42:13,344
I should have been focused on you.

607
00:42:13,844 --> 00:42:16,044
I'm crying right now!

608
00:42:16,044 --> 00:42:18,344
Nerissa, I'm so sorry!

609
00:42:18,344 --> 00:42:21,344
I'm so sorry, as one of the boys.

610
00:42:21,644 --> 00:42:24,044
This is your fitting apology.

611
00:42:24,644 --> 00:42:25,844
Thank you.

612
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:30,344
I guess in your universe I have two boyfriends?

613
00:42:30,344 --> 00:42:33,044
I'm dating both you and Bachelor Number 2.

614
00:42:33,044 --> 00:42:34,344
I forgive you for that, by the way.

615
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:35,344
I'm just gonna forgive you.

616
00:42:35,644 --> 00:42:37,444
Oh, very understanding lover.

617
00:42:37,444 --> 00:42:39,344
It's understanding, we were gaming too hard!

618
00:42:39,344 --> 00:42:40,544
I know, I know!

619
00:42:40,544 --> 00:42:41,644
It was so great!

620
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:43,644
Sugoi guy over here!

621
00:42:45,744 --> 00:42:49,144
Well, I think I'm getting closer to my answer...

622
00:42:49,144 --> 00:42:52,844
of which one of these lovely bachelors I'm going to pick.

623
00:42:52,844 --> 00:42:55,844
But I think we're going to maybe need one more question.

624
00:42:56,244 --> 00:42:57,244
One?

625
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:58,144
Oh, one more!

626
00:42:58,144 --> 00:42:59,344
Okay! Wow!

627
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,844
Let's move on to the final question!

628
00:43:02,844 --> 00:43:06,344
And after this one, Nerissa makes her decision about who she chooses!

629
00:43:06,344 --> 00:43:10,244
So Nerissa, please answer carefully, okay?

630
00:43:10,244 --> 00:43:11,344
Choose from the heart, okay?

631
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:12,844
I will.

632
00:43:12,844 --> 00:43:14,344
Mm-hmm. From the heart.

633
00:43:17,944 --> 00:43:21,344
Yeah, in fact, Nerissa, why don't you read the final question so you can finally see.

634
00:43:22,244 --> 00:43:23,344
Oh, I see. Okay.

635
00:43:23,844 --> 00:43:26,344
Question number five: My Eternity.

636
00:43:27,844 --> 00:43:30,344
This is your moment, bachelors.

637
00:43:30,344 --> 00:43:33,844
Make the ultimate marriage proposal to me.

638
00:43:35,244 --> 00:43:39,844
Marriage proposal? I've never made a marriage proposal before!

639
00:43:41,044 --> 00:43:42,344
Now's the time.

640
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:45,344
So let me put my blindfold back on...

641
00:43:45,344 --> 00:43:48,144
and I'm looking forward to seeing your answers... or hearing them.

642
00:43:48,144 --> 00:43:51,844
Two years and she still can't see us.

643
00:43:51,844 --> 00:43:55,844
Um, you know... the marriage proposal...

644
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:59,344
...should we really be going to the mic?

645
00:44:00,344 --> 00:44:03,144
I guess you guys can do whatever you'd like.

646
00:44:03,144 --> 00:44:05,344
Bachelor Number 1, will you approach?

647
00:44:05,344 --> 00:44:11,344
Thinking... slowly... thinking...

648
00:44:14,344 --> 00:44:16,344
Bachelor Number 1, do you not love me or something?

649
00:44:16,344 --> 00:44:17,344
Where are you?

650
00:44:17,344 --> 00:44:20,144
It's such a special day, we've been out to dinner at my favorite restaurant.

651
00:44:20,144 --> 00:44:24,344
Are you standing me up on such a special day?

652
00:44:41,144 --> 00:44:43,644
Nerissa Ravencroft?

653
00:44:43,644 --> 00:44:44,644
Yes.

654
00:44:45,144 --> 00:44:47,044
What's so funny?

655
00:44:48,344 --> 00:44:52,344
Will you marry me?

656
00:44:53,344 --> 00:44:54,344
Yes!

657
00:44:54,344 --> 00:44:58,344
Just like that? Just like that? Please! Please!

658
00:44:58,344 --> 00:45:01,344
Yes! Yes!

659
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,652
She said yes!

660
00:45:05,652 --> 00:45:06,352
She said yes!

661
00:45:06,352 --> 00:45:08,219
YES!

662
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:09,785
Congratulations!

663
00:45:09,785 --> 00:45:12,085
I mean, we've been dating for two years.

664
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:12,885
What do you mean?

665
00:45:12,885 --> 00:45:14,319
We're getting married!

666
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,652
We're getting married with Bachelor Number Two!

667
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:23,785
This is your moment...
Make the ultimate marriage proposal!

668
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:28,719
Boom.

669
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:31,785
I tossed something on the ground, pick it up.

670
00:45:31,785 --> 00:45:34,519
I know you're blindfolded, pick it up anyway.

671
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:35,719
Pick it up.

672
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:36,652
What?

673
00:45:44,752 --> 00:45:45,652
It was a ring!

674
00:45:45,652 --> 00:45:47,185
I put a ring on your finger!

675
00:45:47,185 --> 00:45:48,519
We're engaged!

676
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:50,285
It looks like handcuffs!

677
00:45:50,285 --> 00:45:51,652
Someone help!

678
00:45:51,652 --> 00:45:52,885
We're engaged now!

679
00:45:52,885 --> 00:45:54,452
Help! Don't ring!

680
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:56,885
That's the wrong hand!

681
00:45:58,919 --> 00:46:00,219
I will marry you!

682
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:01,585
Get out of here!

683
00:46:01,585 --> 00:46:03,319
Go!

684
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,252
Get out!

685
00:46:06,819 --> 00:46:08,652
That was so scary!

686
00:46:08,652 --> 00:46:10,452
I'm so scared!

687
00:46:10,452 --> 00:46:12,519
Gotta go comfort her now.

688
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,252
Yeah, please, no more harassment, Bachelors.

689
00:46:15,252 --> 00:46:18,219
Let's move on to Bachelor Number Three please.

690
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:19,852
No more Bachelor Number Two.

691
00:46:19,852 --> 00:46:22,552
Bachelor Number Three, please.

692
00:46:31,785 --> 00:46:35,219
Don't let us be apart.

693
00:46:35,385 --> 00:46:38,219
Many seasons that have passed since we met...

694
00:46:39,652 --> 00:46:42,519
Many memories, hard times...

695
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:44,352
Beautiful times.

696
00:46:44,352 --> 00:46:46,719
Many tears we shed together...

697
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:48,519
We watched the sunrise.

698
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:51,185
I'd like to spend many more sunrises...

699
00:46:51,185 --> 00:46:53,352
And sunsets together.

700
00:46:54,552 --> 00:46:56,452
Will you be my everything?

701
00:46:56,452 --> 00:46:57,352
Yes!

702
00:46:57,352 --> 00:46:59,652
Oh, that was so sweet!

703
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:02,552
Bachelor Number Three...

704
00:47:02,552 --> 00:47:04,585
You're so sweet!

705
00:47:06,485 --> 00:47:08,919
I don't feel like I should clap.

706
00:47:09,419 --> 00:47:10,352
Alright.

707
00:47:10,352 --> 00:47:11,752
You don't have to.

708
00:47:11,752 --> 00:47:12,652
It's okay.

709
00:47:12,652 --> 00:47:14,252
We have one more contestant.

710
00:47:14,252 --> 00:47:16,119
Bachelor Number Four, would you please...

711
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:17,452
Approach?

712
00:47:21,652 --> 00:47:23,785
What's going on?

713
00:47:25,352 --> 00:47:26,685
My bro.

714
00:47:26,685 --> 00:47:27,685
Yes?

715
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:30,885
You are like the bro-est of my life.

716
00:47:30,885 --> 00:47:32,485
Wait, what the heck's going on?

717
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:33,319
Thanks.

718
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:35,452
We've been gaming for like two years or more.

719
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:36,719
Yeah, bro, we have.

720
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:37,319
I know.

721
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:38,485
Wow.

722
00:47:38,485 --> 00:47:40,785
I love playing farming games with you.

723
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:40,785
Hello?

724
00:47:40,785 --> 00:47:42,519
I love playing shooting games with you.

725
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:45,219
You are my number two, or my number one even.

726
00:47:45,219 --> 00:47:46,519
I'll be your number two.

727
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:46,519
Hello?

728
00:47:47,619 --> 00:47:50,085
You're just... I just love you so much, my bro.

729
00:47:50,085 --> 00:47:51,185
Whoa, thanks, bro.

730
00:47:51,652 --> 00:47:53,485
Will you marry me?

731
00:47:55,852 --> 00:47:58,219
Well, I think I'm disqualified!

732
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,419
Bachelor Number Four, get out of here!

733
00:48:02,652 --> 00:48:03,652
They're married!

734
00:48:03,652 --> 00:48:04,919
Oh my god!

735
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:07,585
Get out!

736
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:12,085
And with that, the questions are through.

737
00:48:14,852 --> 00:48:17,085
She can come to the wedding though.

738
00:48:17,085 --> 00:48:20,519
We've had some awesome love stories,

739
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:23,785
Awesome maybe, if you can call it that, love stories born.

740
00:48:23,785 --> 00:48:25,252
Some good, some bad.

741
00:48:25,252 --> 00:48:26,885
From one to four!

742
00:48:26,885 --> 00:48:28,719
Who did you like the most?

743
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:30,819
Please give us the number, Nerissa!

744
00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:32,485
Yeah, who is the most romantic?

745
00:48:32,485 --> 00:48:35,252
I'm gonna go backwards, actually.

746
00:48:36,252 --> 00:48:39,652
I think it's obvious which Bachelor did NOT steal my heart today.

747
00:48:39,652 --> 00:48:40,885
Oh, that way, huh?

748
00:48:43,185 --> 00:48:45,319
Bachelor Number Two, step forward.

749
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:46,819
You're disqualified!

750
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,319
Alright, Bachelor Number Four, step forward.

751
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:56,885
You're disqualified!

752
00:49:03,419 --> 00:49:05,619
Somehow I feel like I knew it was you two.

753
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:07,419
I don't know what you're talking about!

754
00:49:07,419 --> 00:49:08,585
Come on, wifey!

755
00:49:08,585 --> 00:49:10,352
This is the hard part now.

756
00:49:10,352 --> 00:49:12,852
I'm between Bachelors Number One and Bachelor Number Three.

757
00:49:12,852 --> 00:49:15,252
Who stole my heart the most?

758
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,452
Was it the earnest Bachelor Number One?

759
00:49:17,452 --> 00:49:20,685
Or the very sweet Bachelor Number Three who seemed to know me best?

760
00:49:24,485 --> 00:49:26,385
Ah, I can't decide!

761
00:49:26,385 --> 00:49:28,719
But if I had to pick between this impossible decision...

762
00:49:31,785 --> 00:49:34,119
I'd have to pick Bachelor Number Three!

763
00:49:40,885 --> 00:49:42,519
You can join the marriage!

764
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:43,385
It's okay!

765
00:49:43,385 --> 00:49:44,719
You can join with me!

766
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:46,252
It's okay, you can join!

767
00:49:46,252 --> 00:49:47,385
Yeah, we're married!

768
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:48,519
It's okay!

769
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:49,685
Join the marriage!

770
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,752
But I must say,

771
00:49:52,752 --> 00:49:56,319
Knowing that each of you thought so deeply about a life with me,

772
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:57,619
Except some of you maybe...

773
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:00,552
It makes me feel so special on my special day.

774
00:50:00,552 --> 00:50:03,319
So thank you for warming my heart.

775
00:50:03,907 --> 00:50:04,907
Congrats!

776
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:08,407
Happy Birthday!

777
00:50:09,407 --> 00:50:11,407
Happy Birthday!

778
00:50:13,007 --> 00:50:14,407
Happy birthday, I guess.

779
00:50:23,307 --> 00:50:24,207
Rissa!

780
00:50:24,407 --> 00:50:25,707
You're so fluffy!

781
00:50:29,007 --> 00:50:30,107
I love you!

782
00:50:30,407 --> 00:50:31,607
I love you!

783
00:51:04,707 --> 00:51:07,807
Ah... what a wonderful birthday this is.

784
00:51:08,007 --> 00:51:10,407
I've even found a wonderful partner!

785
00:51:11,007 --> 00:51:15,207
It feels like this next year of my life is going to be so amazing!

786
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:18,407
I know, my baby!

787
00:51:19,007 --> 00:51:21,207
Hey, the blind date is over!

788
00:51:21,407 --> 00:51:23,707
Snap back to reality. Oh, let's play Twister!

789
00:51:24,307 --> 00:51:25,407
Oh, yeah!

790
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:30,407
I got Twister ready so we can all play together!

791
00:51:31,407 --> 00:51:34,907
Looking at it, it might be a bit tricky for all five of us to play at once though.

792
00:51:35,107 --> 00:51:36,707
Yeah, I think you might be right.

793
00:51:37,007 --> 00:51:38,107
What should we do then?

794
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:42,107
Um... well, how about to make it fun, we can play one at a time?

795
00:51:42,907 --> 00:51:46,407
You know what, actually, I've just thought of a special rule for today!

796
00:51:46,907 --> 00:51:49,407
Let's call the game: Posing Twister!

797
00:51:47,807 --> 00:51:50,407
Posing Twister

798
00:51:53,107 --> 00:51:57,207
As the name suggests, the rule is to strike poses while playing Twister.

799
00:51:57,907 --> 00:52:01,407
For example, if the instruction says:

800
00:52:01,507 --> 00:52:06,007
"Right hand on red, and cat pose", you place your right hand on red and do the cat pose.

801
00:52:06,307 --> 00:52:11,407
Once all four limbs are in position, you can move just one limb to strike the specific pose.

802
00:52:12,407 --> 00:52:17,407
The time limit will be one minute, and if you can keep your balance for the full minute, you can clear the challenge.

803
00:52:18,707 --> 00:52:21,907
But, if you lose your balance at any point, the game is over.

804
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:24,007
Quick question!

805
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:24,807
Yes?

806
00:52:24,907 --> 00:52:26,707
Can audience mess with the player?

807
00:52:27,107 --> 00:52:28,407
Yeah, why not?

808
00:52:28,907 --> 00:52:30,407
So, who wants to go first?

809
00:52:34,407 --> 00:52:36,907
I'll go first! Ok, Mococo-chan!

810
00:52:37,207 --> 00:52:39,407
I'll go first! Ok, I'll go, Mococo-chan!

811
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,407
I'll show you how it's done, okay?

812
00:52:43,507 --> 00:52:46,407
I'll try my best to distract you, so good luck!

813
00:52:47,607 --> 00:52:49,407
I've never played Twister before.

814
00:52:49,707 --> 00:52:50,707
Really?

815
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:52,207
It's her first time then!

816
00:52:53,407 --> 00:52:55,407
Well, you've got one minute, okay?

817
00:52:55,607 --> 00:52:56,407
Do your best.

818
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:57,607
We ready?

819
00:52:57,907 --> 00:52:59,207
Then let's start!

820
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:01,207
Okay!

821
00:53:01,407 --> 00:53:06,407
Okay, first up, left foot on green and wolf pose!

822
00:53:02,407 --> 00:53:06,407
Left foot on green, wolf pose!

823
00:53:11,007 --> 00:53:14,407
Okay, next, right hand on red and cat pose!

824
00:53:12,407 --> 00:53:14,407
Right hand on red, cat pose!

825
00:53:14,707 --> 00:53:16,907
That was some pretty fast poses!

826
00:53:17,407 --> 00:53:20,407
Right hand, faster, faster!

827
00:53:20,907 --> 00:53:24,407
Left foot on blue, cow pose!

828
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:24,407
Left foot on blue, cow pose!

829
00:53:32,707 --> 00:53:36,407
All right, right hand on red and hero pose!

830
00:53:33,407 --> 00:53:36,407
Right hand on red, hero pose!

831
00:53:36,707 --> 00:53:39,707
Right hand on red and a hero!

832
00:53:40,107 --> 00:53:41,707
Oh, I thought my right hand is on red.

833
00:53:42,107 --> 00:53:44,907
Oh, right hand on red again. I can't help it!

834
00:53:48,007 --> 00:53:50,907
Left hand on yellow and happy pose!

835
00:53:48,407 --> 00:53:50,907
Left hand on yellow, happy pose!

836
00:53:51,407 --> 00:53:53,707
So happy, happy, happy!

837
00:53:54,407 --> 00:53:58,407
Now place your left foot on yellow and express anger!

838
00:53:55,407 --> 00:53:58,407
Left foot on yellow, angry pose!

839
00:53:58,707 --> 00:54:01,407
I'm furious! So much rage!

840
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,707
You did so good!

841
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:13,407
Rissa, it feels like I'm split apart! Help! Help!

842
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:16,407
You did so good!

843
00:54:16,907 --> 00:54:19,907
All right, Mococo! You passed with flying colors.

844
00:54:20,407 --> 00:54:23,407
Don't fall, you okay?

845
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:26,407
Good job, Mococo!

846
00:54:27,407 --> 00:54:29,407
All right, who's next? Mococo?

847
00:54:31,707 --> 00:54:32,907
You get to choose!

848
00:54:33,907 --> 00:54:35,907
Bijou! I want Bijou!

849
00:54:35,107 --> 00:54:37,907
Because you made fun of me at the beginning!

850
00:54:38,407 --> 00:54:39,407
Okay!

851
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:44,407
Because of that, I'm going to be your biggest distraction, okay?

852
00:54:45,107 --> 00:54:47,407
Okay, how about I tell Bijou what to do then?

853
00:54:48,107 --> 00:54:49,407
Okay! All right, let's start!

854
00:54:50,407 --> 00:54:53,907
Right foot on blue... okay...

855
00:54:51,407 --> 00:54:56,407
Right foot on blue, graceful queen pose!

856
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:56,907
Now give me a graceful queen pose!

857
00:54:57,107 --> 00:54:59,707
Oh my! Okay, Miss Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame!

858
00:55:01,328 --> 00:55:04,828
Left foot on blue, lion pose!

859
00:55:01,328 --> 00:55:02,628
Left foot on blue...

860
00:55:02,628 --> 00:55:04,828
...now do a lion pose.

861
00:55:05,528 --> 00:55:09,828
(Roaring)

862
00:55:10,028 --> 00:55:14,828
Left hand on red, rabbit pose!

863
00:55:10,028 --> 00:55:11,828
Left hand on red...

864
00:55:11,828 --> 00:55:14,828
...give me a rabbit pose.

865
00:55:14,828 --> 00:55:15,628
Rabbit?

866
00:55:15,628 --> 00:55:16,828
What does the rabbit say?

867
00:55:16,828 --> 00:55:18,728
Figure it out! I'm not a rabbit!

868
00:55:18,728 --> 00:55:21,828
Peko! Peko!

869
00:55:21,828 --> 00:55:27,628
Right foot on green, BAUBAU!

870
00:55:21,828 --> 00:55:23,828
Now place your right foot on green...

871
00:55:25,328 --> 00:55:27,628
...and go BAUBAU!

872
00:55:27,628 --> 00:55:32,128
BAUBAU! BAUBAU! BAUBAU!

873
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:37,828
Left foot on red, "grr" pose!

874
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:34,328
Left foot on red...

875
00:55:34,328 --> 00:55:37,828
Oh... figure it out!

876
00:55:37,828 --> 00:55:39,828
Now give us your best grr pose!

877
00:55:39,828 --> 00:55:43,828
Grrr!

878
00:55:44,328 --> 00:55:49,128

883
00:55:55,328 --> 00:55:56,828
Fair enough for me.

884
00:55:58,828 --> 00:56:01,328
You didn't lose your balance, but I didn't think that was a very cute pose at the end.

885
00:56:01,328 --> 00:56:02,628
What about you guys?

01:17:34,606 --> 01:17:39,606
ア・ミズイ・ア・アマ・アイ・ワナ
A-mizui a-ama I wanna

1194
01:17:39,606 --> 01:17:44,106
ア・ハマってあげようか
Ah, shall I fall for you?

1195
01:17:44,606 --> 01:17:47,106
ア・自在に感情
Ah, my emotions at will

1196
01:17:47,106 --> 01:17:49,606
露出して痛い
Exposing them hurts

1197
01:17:49,606 --> 01:17:52,106
はずなのに
Even though it shouldn't

1198
01:17:54,506 --> 01:17:57,006
フラフラで酔いちゃいそうな
Feeling dizzy and about to get drunk

1199
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:59,506
甘い匂いに誘われて
Lured by a sweet scent

1200
01:17:59,506 --> 01:18:02,006
フラフラで酔いちゃいそうな
Feeling dizzy and about to get drunk

1201
01:18:02,006 --> 01:18:04,506
羽の休め場所を探して
Searching for a place to rest my wings

1202
01:18:04,506 --> 01:18:07,006
逃げたい わけじゃなくて
It's not that I want to run away

1203
01:18:07,006 --> 01:18:09,506
フラフラしちゃうじゃない
But I'm getting all dizzy

1204
01:18:09,506 --> 01:18:12,006
分かっても 君の前じゃ絶対
Even if I know, when I'm in front of you, definitely

1205
01:18:12,006 --> 01:18:15,106
Help me stay!

1206
01:18:25,106 --> 01:18:27,606
メーデー 舵が取れないの
Mayday, I can't steer

1207
01:18:27,606 --> 01:18:30,106
気持ちがモヤっと晴れないし
My feelings are hazy and won't clear

1208
01:18:30,106 --> 01:18:32,606
メーデー なんていられない
Mayday, I can't just stay like this

1209
01:18:32,606 --> 01:18:35,106
まだ秘密の合図 染め模様
Still a secret signal, a dyed pattern

1210
01:18:35,106 --> 01:18:37,606
絶対 あれはわけじゃない
That's definitely not the reason

1211
01:18:37,606 --> 01:18:40,106
鏡の中だけの勘違い
Just a misunderstanding in the mirror

1212
01:18:40,106 --> 01:18:42,606
将来 なんていらないわ
I don't need a future

1213
01:18:42,606 --> 01:18:45,106
大人びて見えぬこの感情
These emotions that don't look mature

1214
01:18:45,306 --> 01:18:47,806
弾けて 溶け出すような
Like popping and melting away

1215
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:50,306
太陽に見舞われて
Encountering the sun

1216
01:18:50,306 --> 01:18:52,806
壊して 私じゃないわ
Break it, it's not me

1217
01:18:52,806 --> 01:18:55,306
Don't miss me stay!

1218
01:18:55,306 --> 01:18:57,806
イヤイヤ でも寝ちゃうくらいに
No no, but enough to fall asleep

1219
01:18:57,806 --> 01:19:00,306
足元 踏まれてて
Stepped on my feet

1220
01:19:00,306 --> 01:19:02,806
何でも 私側絶対
Anything, on my side, definitely

1221
01:19:02,806 --> 01:19:06,106
Let me stay!

1222
01:19:15,606 --> 01:19:18,606
ねえ どうして
Hey, why

1223
01:19:19,606 --> 01:19:25,106
愛はいたずらするんだろう
Does love play tricks?

1224
01:19:25,606 --> 01:19:28,606
ねえ いつかは
Hey, will it someday

1225
01:19:29,606 --> 01:19:35,106
叶いたいもの 消えるの？
The things I want to come true, will they vanish?

1226
01:19:46,406 --> 01:19:48,906
本来は案外簡単に
Originally, it's surprisingly easy

1227
01:19:48,906 --> 01:19:51,406
否定して壊せちゃうけど
To deny and break it

1228
01:19:51,406 --> 01:19:55,906
歪なこの感情が
But these distorted emotions

1229
01:19:56,406 --> 01:19:58,906
気が付くと手を伸ばしちゃって
Before I know it, I'm reaching out

1230
01:19:58,906 --> 01:20:01,106
その度 苦しくて
And each time, it's painful

1231
01:20:01,554 --> 01:20:02,554
...もっと奪ってよ プラスチック・ラブ
...Gimme more of that plastic love

1232
01:20:07,354 --> 01:20:09,554
痛い 居たいのさ Cry
It hurts, I want to be here, Cry

1233
01:20:10,054 --> 01:20:12,054
落ち着く場所
A place to settle down

1234
01:20:12,554 --> 01:20:15,554
ほら 連れ出してよ ほら Mayday
Look, take me away, look, Mayday

1235
01:20:17,554 --> 01:20:20,054
グラグラで酔っちゃいそうな名前に...
To a name that seems like it'll make me dizzy...

1236
01:20:20,554 --> 01:20:22,054
...誘われて
...being invited

1237
01:20:22,554 --> 01:20:27,054
ほらほら 酔っちゃうわ あぁ もう正体...
Look, look, I'm getting drunk, ah, my true identity...

1238
01:20:28,054 --> 01:20:29,554
Help me, help me

1239
01:20:30,054 --> 01:20:31,554
Rescue me, rescue me

1240
01:20:32,554 --> 01:20:34,554
Save me, save me

1241
01:20:35,054 --> 01:20:37,054
Mayday, rescue me

1242
01:20:37,554 --> 01:20:42,054
だって もっと 目立っちゃいたいのに もっと...
Because I want to stand out more, even more...

1243
01:20:42,554 --> 01:20:45,554
...外れ出したいんだ もう Mayday
...I want to start breaking away, Mayday

1244
01:20:46,054 --> 01:20:48,054
して
Do it

1245
01:21:05,054 --> 01:21:07,554
Huzzah! Whoo! Hey!

1246
01:21:08,054 --> 01:21:09,554

Thank you, Liz!

1249
01:21:13,354 --> 01:21:16,054
And, hmm, you better have a freaking wonderful rest of your day,

1250
01:21:16,054 --> 01:21:18,554
because I'm monitoring you, alright?

1251
01:21:19,054 --> 01:21:20,554
You got it, boss!

1252
01:21:21,054 --> 01:21:22,554
Thanks for the invite!

1253
01:21:26,054 --> 01:21:28,054
For Justice! Oh!

1254
01:21:29,054 --> 01:21:31,054
Ack! And she's gone.

1255
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:34,054
Goodbye, Liz! I love you!

1256
01:21:37,554 --> 01:21:41,554
Good day, Nerissa Ravencroft, mother of my child!

1257
01:21:41,554 --> 01:21:44,554

Put your hands up, put your, put your hands up!

1260
01:21:52,554 --> 01:21:55,554

Hey hey, it came out

1296
01:25:00,569 --> 01:25:01,569
Next up!

1297
01:25:01,569 --> 01:25:05,069
Let's go ahead and introduce this year's birthday merch!

1298
01:25:05,069 --> 01:25:06,869
Yay!

1299
01:25:06,869 --> 01:25:09,069
Please take a look at the set.

1300
01:25:09,069 --> 01:25:13,069
There's also gonna be a limited set that comes with an autographed postcard!

1301
01:25:13,069 --> 01:25:14,069
Wow!

1302
01:25:14,069 --> 01:25:17,369
So let's take a look at all the details.

1303
01:25:17,869 --> 01:25:19,569
First up,

1304
01:25:19,569 --> 01:25:21,569
can you believe it?

1305
01:25:21,569 --> 01:25:24,569
I made a Jailbird onesie!

1306
01:25:24,569 --> 01:25:27,069
Isn't it so cute?

1307
01:25:27,069 --> 01:25:28,069
It looks so fluffy.

1308
01:25:28,069 --> 01:25:29,569
It looks so comfy.

1309
01:25:29,569 --> 01:25:33,069
It's perfect if you want to let out your inner Fat Flock member.

1310
01:25:33,069 --> 01:25:35,069
You can wear it to sleep,

1311
01:25:35,069 --> 01:25:37,069
you can wear it out, you can wear it...

1312
01:25:37,069 --> 01:25:40,069
Who cares? You wear it wherever you want. It's a kigurumi!

1313
01:25:40,069 --> 01:25:43,569
So, do consider picking it up, please.

1314
01:25:43,569 --> 01:25:45,069
All right!

1315
01:25:45,069 --> 01:25:47,569
And then the next item is...

1316
01:25:48,069 --> 01:25:50,569
the Jailbird beanie!

1317
01:25:50,569 --> 01:25:52,069
Do you want to look cool?

1318
01:25:52,069 --> 01:25:57,069
Do you want to look nonchalant while also repping the Jailbirds?

1319
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:59,569
Repping the Fat Flock?

1320
01:25:59,569 --> 01:26:03,569
Now you can with this beepin' beanie! It even has a Jailbird embroider on it.

1321
01:26:03,569 --> 01:26:06,069
Look at the little horns!

1322
01:26:06,069 --> 01:26:08,569
They're so cute!

1323
01:26:08,569 --> 01:26:11,569
It's so cool and cute at the same time.

1324
01:26:11,569 --> 01:26:14,069
And now for the third item.

1325
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:17,569
Yo, this is so cool!

1326
01:26:17,569 --> 01:26:24,069
Cool as ICE, I might say, the Jailbird ice tray!

1327
01:26:24,069 --> 01:26:28,569
You can make six different Jailbird ice cubes.

1328
01:26:28,569 --> 01:26:32,569
They're so cute! Look at all those expressions too.

1329
01:26:32,569 --> 01:26:37,569
I can't wait to use this and put this in my matcha lattes.

1330
01:26:37,569 --> 01:26:41,069
What do you think? What are you going to use it for, Shiori?

1331
01:26:41,569 --> 01:26:45,569
Uh, I don't know. I think I'm going to put it in matcha lattes too.

1332
01:26:45,569 --> 01:26:48,569
But I think I could just put it in my water, I could put it in anything.

1333
01:26:48,569 --> 01:26:51,069
You could just take them, you could chuck 'em too.

1334
01:26:51,569 --> 01:26:54,569
Not at people, but like, at the floor.

1335
01:26:54,569 --> 01:26:57,069
At people would be okay too.

1336
01:26:57,069 --> 01:27:00,569
No, no, no! Not at people, you meanie!

1337
01:27:00,569 --> 01:27:02,069
Mococo-chan, save us!

1338
01:27:02,069 --> 01:27:03,569
Next one!

1339
01:27:03,569 --> 01:27:08,069
And with this, the 'Day-Out With Nerissa' acrylic keychain.

1340
01:27:08,069 --> 01:27:11,569
You can take it along with you, take Nerissa everywhere you go,

1341
01:27:11,569 --> 01:27:14,069
and take cute photos!

1342
01:27:14,069 --> 01:27:18,069
You know, just like you're uploading it to my favorite app,

1343
01:27:18,069 --> 01:27:20,069
Nerissa Ravencroft.

1344
01:27:20,069 --> 01:27:22,569
That's the best one!

1345
01:27:22,569 --> 01:27:26,069
Her favorite app says 'Nerissa Ravencroft'!

1346
01:27:26,069 --> 01:27:29,569
Yes! This illustration is done by my mama as well!

1347
01:27:29,569 --> 01:27:34,069
So it'd be awesome if you would share photos with this item on SNS

1348
01:27:34,069 --> 01:27:39,069
using the hashtag #DateWithNerissa, please.

1349
01:27:39,069 --> 01:27:40,569
Did you just...

1350
01:27:41,069 --> 01:27:43,069
Never mind.

1351
01:27:43,569 --> 01:27:45,069
And of course,

1352
01:27:45,069 --> 01:27:50,569
there's also a birthday set that includes a postcard and a bonus voice pack,

1353
01:27:50,569 --> 01:27:55,069
along with these four items. Only the limited edition comes with an autographed postcard.

1354
01:27:55,069 --> 01:27:59,569
So don't wait, get yours now for your Fat Flock friends.

1355
01:27:59,569 --> 01:28:02,069
Yes!

1356
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:08,569
Now, what's this 'Day-Out With Nerissa' bonus voice pack like, huh? Do you have a preview?

1357
01:28:09,069 --> 01:28:13,069
I guess I could tell you a little bit about it.

1358
01:28:13,069 --> 01:28:16,069
Well, it's actually based off of the illustration.

1359
01:28:16,069 --> 01:28:20,069
So, uh, it's a day out, similar to the dates that you guys came out with.

1360
01:28:20,069 --> 01:28:25,569
I'm going to be going on a date with the Jailbirds to an amusement park.

1361
01:28:25,569 --> 01:28:28,569
So you can look forward to the shenanigans that ensue.

1362
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:31,569
Shenanigans! Always shenanigans.

1363
01:28:32,069 --> 01:28:37,069
Anyways, I worked really hard to come up with all this merch so that everybody could enjoy it.

1364
01:28:37,069 --> 01:28:42,069
So be sure to grab yours as soon as it goes live. The link will be in the description.

1365
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:48,069
Well, this turned out to be such a wonderful birthday!

1366
01:28:48,069 --> 01:28:49,569
Yes!

1367
01:28:49,569 --> 01:28:54,569
And Advent, I'm so happy that we could celebrate all together as well, it made it so special for me.

1368
01:28:54,569 --> 01:28:59,569
Yay! Happy birthday, Nerissa!

1369
01:29:00,069 --> 01:29:03,069
And, we also had Justice as guests too, singing with me.

1370
01:29:03,069 --> 01:29:07,069
So thank you Justice for coming and celebrating with me as well.

1371
01:29:07,069 --> 01:29:10,069
And, most of all, thank you Jailbirds!

1372
01:29:10,569 --> 01:29:14,069
Thank you everyone! Happy birthday!

1373
01:29:15,569 --> 01:29:18,569
Bye-bye!

1374
01:29:21,069 --> 01:29:49,603
Jailbirds, thank you for coming to my 3rd BIRTHDAY here in hololive!
You've truly made the last few years of my life so incredibly memorable.
I can't wait to see where this next year of my life with Advent, hololive, and you takes me!

1375
01:29:21,069 --> 01:29:49,603
Thanks for always supporting me, and let's keep doing our best!!!
-Nerissa
