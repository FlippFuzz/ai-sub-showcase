00:05:23,248 --> 00:05:25,148
Nerissa...

3
00:05:26,548 --> 00:05:29,048
When was the last time we saw her?

4
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:33,548
She hasn't left her room in two weeks.

5
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:38,248
She doesn't love us anymore!

6
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:43,948
Fear not, my friends.

7
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:45,948
Is that Jailboss?

8
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:49,848
Tonight, we infiltrate her bedroom.

9
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:51,548
Follow me.

10
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:53,948
I know a secret passage.

11
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:04,548
Nerissa!

12
00:06:07,148 --> 00:06:08,548
Nerissa!

13
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:09,848
Nerissa!

14
00:06:10,548 --> 00:06:11,848
Oh no!

15
00:06:12,048 --> 00:06:14,248
You dare enter my room?

16
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:15,548
With that—

17
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:18,548
Don't mess with a girl's sleepover!

18
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:40,848
生まれ変わった
A reborn...

19
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:44,848
赤い花
...red flower.

20
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:49,048
誰のために咲くのか
For whom does it bloom?

21
00:06:53,048 --> 00:06:55,948
ゆらゆら
Swaying, swaying...

22
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:59,048
答えのないまま
...without an answer.

23
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:11,248
運命は脆く
Fate is fragile,

24
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:14,048
愚かな結末
a foolish ending.

25
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:16,348
磔にされた
Crucified,

26
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:19,048
心は泣いてる
my heart is weeping.

27
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:21,048
予定調和を
Knowing the pre-established harmony,

28
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:24,048
知るこの雫が
this teardrop...

29
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:28,048
貴方には見えていないのでしょう
...is invisible to you, isn't it?

30
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,848
なら
If so,

31
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:33,248
此処まで
this is the end.

32
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:36,248
悲しい声に 言葉に
Driven away by sad voices,

33
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,248
追いやられて
by words...

34
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:41,248
俯いたまま 微笑む
Smiling while looking down,

35
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:43,548
赤い花
the red flower.

36
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:46,548
深く根を張る 痛みが
If this deep-rooted pain

37
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:48,548
贖罪なら
is my atonement...

38
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:51,548
分かり合えない
We can never understand each other.

39
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:55,048
ずっとこのまま
It will remain like this forever.

40
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:07,048
変わらない運命
Unchanging destiny,

41
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:10,048
周囲は不条理
surrounded by absurdity.

42
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:12,348
剥き出しにされた
Exposed,

43
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:14,548
感覚の違い
the difference in our senses.

44
00:08:14,548 --> 00:08:17,048
ありふれた刃を
Brandishing a common blade,

45
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:19,348
振りかざす
you swing it down.

46
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:24,048
貴方には見えていないのでしょう
You probably cannot see it, can you?

47
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:26,048
もう
Anymore...

48
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,548
消えない
...it won't disappear.

49
00:08:29,048 --> 00:08:32,048
傷
This wound.

50
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:42,548
風が吹く夜に
In the wind-blown night,

51
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:45,048
散ってしまう花の色を
the color of the scattering flower...

52
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:47,848
貴方は知ることもきっと
...you will surely never even know,

53
00:08:47,848 --> 00:08:49,048
ないのでしょう
will you?

54
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:50,848
底の底まで
Falling to the very bottom,

55
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,248
堕ちたら
if I fall...

56
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:54,048
黒い景色
...into a black scenery.

57
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:56,548
俯いたまま 泣いていた
Crying while looking down,

58
00:08:56,548 --> 00:08:59,048
赤い花
the red flower.

59
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:02,048
朽ちていく心の中
Inside this rotting heart,

60
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:04,548
未だ抗ってる
still struggling...

61
00:09:04,548 --> 00:09:07,048
ありのまま
...wanting to live

62
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:11,048
生きていたいと
just as I am.

63
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:14,548
悲しい声に 言葉に
Driven away by sad voices,

64
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:17,048
追いやられて
by words...

65
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:19,848
俯いたまま 散りゆく
Scattering while looking down,

66
00:09:19,848 --> 00:09:22,548
運命でも
even if that is my fate.

67
00:09:22,548 --> 00:09:24,848
深く根を張る 痛みが
Even if this deep-rooted pain

68
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:27,048
消えなくても
does not disappear...

69
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:29,848
藻掻き続ける
I will keep struggling,

70
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:32,248
何度だって
again and again.

71
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:35,548
淡い想いに
To these faint feelings,

72
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:40,048
手を伸ばして
I reach out my hand.

73
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:11,403
My love, where are you?

74
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:14,003
Hello? Are you over here?

75
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:17,253
Oh, there you are!

76
00:10:17,353 --> 00:10:18,203
My darling!

77
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:22,303
Oh, you look so cute laying on my bed like that.

78
00:10:23,153 --> 00:10:24,953
Isn't he just adorable?

79
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:26,803
I just want to squeeze him!

80
00:10:26,903 --> 00:10:29,353
But, I'll leave him be for the time being.

81
00:10:30,403 --> 00:10:31,603
Jailbirds,

82
00:10:31,803 --> 00:10:33,003
I have to welcome you...

83
00:10:33,203 --> 00:10:37,403
to my room, as this is a very, very special day.

84
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:39,103
Do you know?

85
00:10:39,403 --> 00:10:40,503
Do you remember?

86
00:10:40,803 --> 00:10:42,903
That today is my... birthday?

87
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:45,903
In case you don't know me,
let me quick introduce myself.

88
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:47,303
Hiya darlings!

89
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:50,253
This is Hololive English Advent's Devilish Diva,

90
00:10:50,403 --> 00:10:51,803
the one, the only,

91
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:53,353
Nerissa Ravencroft!

92
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:58,003
And I'm so happy to have you in here for my room...
debut.

93
00:10:59,503 --> 00:11:02,353
Being able to celebrate with you guys is so amazing.

94
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:06,103
But, I thought it would be more fun
if I had some friends with me.

95
00:11:06,403 --> 00:11:09,303
So, I've invited some very special people today.

96
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,603
Would you guys please come on in?

97
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:13,303
Yay!

98
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:15,503
What's up you puppies?

99
00:11:15,703 --> 00:11:17,303
Leave him alone!

100
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,803
Bau bau!

101
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:24,903
Advent... Assemble!

102
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:28,203
And we're here today...

103
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:29,803
to celebrate Nerissa!

104
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:31,303
Yay!

105
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:32,503
Happy birthday!

106
00:11:32,703 --> 00:11:34,003
Thank you all for coming.

107
00:11:34,203 --> 00:11:35,703
We're here for your cat.

108
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:37,003
You're here for me, right?

109
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:38,703
We're here for your bed.

110
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:42,003
Ah, yes. What do you guys think, by the way?

111
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:43,303
It smells like you.

112
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,603
I'm glad.

113
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:46,703
I want to show off some details...

114
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:48,803
I know you guys have been here before,

115
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:53,803
but this is the Jailbirds' first ever time
seeing my room.

116
00:11:54,303 --> 00:11:57,003
So, let me go ahead and point out
some of the details.

117
00:11:57,203 --> 00:11:59,403
First, because everyone's so interested in it,

118
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:01,503
I want to highlight the bed area.

119
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:06,103
In this area we have a lot of my personal plushies,

120
00:12:06,303 --> 00:12:06,803
Cat!

121
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:08,003
and my cat.

122
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:11,203
He does have another cat bed,
but he likes to sleep there.

123
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:15,003
It's also... it's very Princess-y, right?
Just like me, right?

124
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:17,803
Babygirl coded.

125
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:20,403
I also have a beautiful painting right above my bed.

126
00:12:21,003 --> 00:12:23,003
And I see something else there. Is that a Jailbird?

127
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:24,903
No, no way.

128
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:26,503
That's not a Jailbird, right?

129
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:27,703
Who knows?

130
00:12:28,003 --> 00:12:29,203
Then, behind me,

131
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:31,003
over behind Fuwamoco,

132
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:32,703
there is this beautiful vanity area.

133
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:36,303
It's my kind of... It makes me feel
even more Princess-y.

134
00:12:36,503 --> 00:12:38,103
You can see there's a bust of my head...

135
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:40,003
Wow, you got a bust made of yourself?

136
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:41,303
It's important.

137
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:43,703
I also have a Renaissance painting.

138
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:48,003
Scattered throughout the room too,
you might notice them,

139
00:12:48,503 --> 00:12:50,203
I have little Advent references.

140
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:53,303
There's a Pero hiding.

141
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:54,703
Somewhere over here.

142
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,703
Up there,

143
00:12:58,003 --> 00:12:59,503
I have a Novalite.

144
00:13:00,703 --> 00:13:01,703
And then over here,

145
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:05,703
over by the vanity area, there's a little Geo. So...

146
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:11,003
Lots of little Advent references
all around for you to enjoy.

147
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:15,003
Yeah, that's it. That's awesome, right? That's it.

148
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,603
Alright, time to leave.

149
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:19,003
Well, thanks for having us.

150
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:21,303
Thanks so much, we're leaving now.

151
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,903
You're leaving? What the? You're not leaving!

152
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:24,903
Oh, I saw your cat.

153
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:28,303
I mean, okay, so are you going to have us
do anything then while we're here?

154
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:32,903
Yes! Well, I've prepared
a very special game today, actually.

155
00:13:34,503 --> 00:13:37,503
I think you guys are going to have a lot of fun.

156
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:41,603
So... It's something a little out of the ordinary.

157
00:13:41,803 --> 00:13:42,803
I'll protect you.

158
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:45,903
Today, you must treat me like your princesses.

159
00:13:47,003 --> 00:13:48,503
Oh? Well, like your princess, actually.

160
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,703
Like a princess? Like a princess?

161
00:13:52,103 --> 00:13:54,503
No, I'm your princess! And you are my princes.

162
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:57,103
So, it's going to be a Blind Date.

163
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,103
You have to make my heart flutter a lot.

164
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,103
And make me feel amazing on my birthday.

165
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:06,503
I guess it sounds like fun then.

166
00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:09,903
I'm the... I'm the one being rizz-ed in this game.

167
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:12,103
I'm excited to see your unexpected sides.

168
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:15,003
So... I need to prep everything in my room.

169
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:18,303
So I need you all to... Get over there.

170
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:20,303
No, no, no, just over there.

171
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:21,503
In the corner.

172
00:14:21,803 --> 00:14:23,703
I'm going to set up everything, okay?

173
00:14:24,903 --> 00:14:26,003
Wait, what if I go around you?

174
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:27,003
I'm setting up!

175
00:14:28,003 --> 00:14:29,403
Are we supposed to get dizzy like this?

176
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,803
I'm gonna pull everything, okay?

177
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,503
Are we supposed to look?

178
00:14:33,603 --> 00:14:34,703
Just spin! Just spin!

179
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:38,703
Just don't worry, it's just...
the furniture's a little heavy.

180
00:14:42,803 --> 00:14:44,303
Let's spin around.

181
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,603
I have everything all ready!

182
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:50,403
Okay!

183
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:51,903
What do you guys think?

184
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:54,003
Whoa! A chair!

185
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:55,503
What is this?

186
00:14:56,003 --> 00:14:57,003
It's a set!

187
00:14:57,203 --> 00:14:59,503
It kind of doesn't match the room's theme though.

188
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:07,444
I'm gonna put on a blindfold too.

189
00:15:07,577 --> 00:15:08,310
What?

190
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,044
Why?

191
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:11,077
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

192
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,277
With Piyans on this projector...

193
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,344
Piyans?

194
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:15,144
Piyans?

195
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:18,510
You guys can relax, okay? Relax.

196
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,077
And come close to me, you're so far away!

197
00:15:22,344 --> 00:15:26,310
So, on this projector here, there's going to be prompts with various questions.

198
00:15:27,044 --> 00:15:28,544
And situations will appear.

199
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:31,944
So you all have to answer them one by one.

200
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:34,677
Your voices are gonna be altered with a voice changer.

201
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:35,244
Oh!

202
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:35,844
Why?

203
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:37,244
Is it gonna be cute?

204
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:37,944
Yeah!

205
00:15:37,944 --> 00:15:40,544
But I'm not gonna be able to know who's talking.

206
00:15:40,944 --> 00:15:41,744
So based on that...

207
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,277
I won't have any preconceptions about anyone.

208
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:48,877
Because it'll just be based on your rizz alone.

209
00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:51,844
So feel free to be extra romantic, okay?

210
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,177
What's that, Shiori?

211
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,777
Don't worry about it.

212
00:15:57,644 --> 00:15:59,877
We'll do our best to be romantic then, huh?

213
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:00,544
Yeah!

214
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,910
Let's start!

215
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:06,010
The name of the game is Cellmate's in Love!

216
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:07,677
Cellmate's in Love!

217
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,210
Cellmate's in Love

218
00:16:11,077 --> 00:16:13,744
The questions for everyone will be displayed on the projector screen.

219
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,344
So please read them carefully.

220
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:18,977
But... I must put my blindfold on now.

221
00:16:22,344 --> 00:16:23,044
Okay.

222
00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:26,144
So I guess she won't know who's answering...

223
00:16:26,244 --> 00:16:28,544
So the person should move quietly.

224
00:16:28,544 --> 00:16:30,344
So she doesn't know the order.

225
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:31,210
Yeah.

226
00:16:31,377 --> 00:16:32,944
And plus we have a voice changer.

227
00:16:32,944 --> 00:16:33,444
Yeah.

228
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:38,744
Okay, well, we should probably line up now, huh?

229
00:16:39,144 --> 00:16:40,044
Okay.

230
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:41,744
Who wants to go first?

231
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,310
I don't know.

232
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,910
I think you should go first.

233
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,010
Okay.

234
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:48,877
Wait, can you answer in this order then?

235
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,577
Yeah!

236
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:51,077
Okay.

237
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:54,144
No!

238
00:16:54,144 --> 00:16:56,244
You read the first question!

239
00:16:58,444 --> 00:16:59,244
First Date!

240
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:00,544
First Date!

241
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,677
It's been over two years since Rissa and I became friends...

242
00:17:05,144 --> 00:17:09,710
But... I think it's time to take our relationship beyond friendship!

243
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,177
Wow.

244
00:17:14,877 --> 00:17:17,877
I'm scared I might ruin what we have...

245
00:17:18,977 --> 00:17:22,644
But... I also really want to tell her how I feel!

246
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:24,377
So...

247
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,244
Everyone, gather your courage...

248
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:30,377
And finally decide to ask Rissa out on a date!

249
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,010
What would you say to her?

250
00:17:33,377 --> 00:17:35,944
And where would you like to go for your first date?

251
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:38,810
Try to ask her smoothly!

252
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:40,444
That was a lot.

253
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,910
Okay, so it's not just a hypothetical situation, right?

254
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,877
It's a long point, isn't it?

255
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:51,344
We all have to figure out how to ask her out.

256
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:54,944
And ask how we are now, right?

257
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,444
Well, are you ready then?

258
00:17:59,077 --> 00:17:59,577
Okay.

259
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:00,544
Bye!

260
00:18:00,577 --> 00:18:01,477
I'm right here!

261
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:02,644
Okay.

262
00:18:07,977 --> 00:18:09,310
Yo Rissa.

263
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:14,144
You know...

264
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:16,344
I've been thinking...

265
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,510
You're really important to me.

266
00:18:20,644 --> 00:18:21,210
And...

267
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,944
I'd like to go out somewhere special together.

268
00:18:24,944 --> 00:18:25,610
And I...

269
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,244
When we have some time.

270
00:18:28,244 --> 00:18:29,844
Just the two of us.

271
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:30,877
You know?

272
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,110
So...

273
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:34,244
I was thinking...

274
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:35,877
Maybe...

275
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:39,644
We could go to that cafe that you said you liked a few months ago.

276
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:41,344
Oh, your favorite, right?

277
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,044
Uh, we could go there.

278
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:45,910
We could have a nice evening and then maybe...

279
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,877
You know, once our tummies are all full.

280
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:52,144
Then we can go on a bit of a stroll.

281
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,544
Enjoy, you know, the city lights...

282
00:18:54,877 --> 00:18:56,244
Maybe the water...

283
00:18:58,144 --> 00:18:59,277
Would you like that?

284
00:18:59,344 --> 00:19:00,377
I would like that!

285
00:19:00,444 --> 00:19:01,744
That sounds so sweet!

286
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:04,210
Well...

287
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,644
Then...

288
00:19:06,277 --> 00:19:07,177
It's a date.

289
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,144
Okay.

290
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,377
Let's do it.

291
00:19:10,444 --> 00:19:11,544
So romantic.

292
00:19:11,644 --> 00:19:12,077
Okay.

293
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,277
I did my best.

294
00:19:14,844 --> 00:19:15,844
You did great!

295
00:19:17,877 --> 00:19:18,410
Okay.

296
00:19:18,477 --> 00:19:19,444
Good job, good job.

297
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:20,677
I'll go.

298
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:21,344
I'll just go.

299
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:21,977
I'll go.

300
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:23,610
Okay. Do your best, Biboo!

301
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:24,277
I'll go.

302
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,710
Show her what you're made of.

303
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,910
Can we lower the mic a little bit for me?

304
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:31,977
I don't think you need that.

305
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,710
No, your love is tall enough.

306
00:19:33,744 --> 00:19:34,744
Wait, uh...

307
00:19:35,144 --> 00:19:37,144
This is kind of mean, isn't it?

308
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:39,644
Deal with it.

309
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:40,944
That's fine.

310
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:41,910
Okay.

311
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,210
I'm ready.

312
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:43,844
I'm ready.

313
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,044
Hey.

314
00:19:47,877 --> 00:19:48,877
Nerissa.

315
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,710
You and me.

316
00:19:51,377 --> 00:19:52,144
Movies.

317
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,577
Tonight.

318
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:55,744
Come or don't.

319
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,610
But if you don't...

320
00:19:57,644 --> 00:20:00,510
You're gonna miss out on so much, baby.

321
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:02,677
You know we're gonna do at the movies?

322
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:04,744
We're gonna pick the scariest movie ever.

323
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:09,932
I'm... I'm gonna cry...

324
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:12,632
I'm gonna cringe at the jumpscares...

325
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:14,932
I'm gonna be so beaming scared,

326
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:17,232
you're gonna have to comfort me.

327
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:19,932
And then you're gonna have to put your arm around my shoulder

328
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:21,932
and be like, "It's okay, sweetie."

329
00:20:21,932 --> 00:20:23,632
"You'll be fine."

330
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:26,432
And then I'm gonna... I'm gonna nuzzle myself into your chest...

331
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:27,932
Yeah, while you comfort me.

332
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:30,232
And we're gonna bond over fear.

333
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:32,432
And it's gonna be the most amazing thing ever.

334
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,932
Oh my gosh, that sounds uh...

335
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:36,932
Whoa... I'm kind of interested.

336
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:38,632
Sounds like a booty call.

337
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:40,232
But I'm a little scared too.

338
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:42,932
I feel like I'm gonna have to be the one comforting you...

339
00:20:42,932 --> 00:20:44,932
I don't know how I feel about that.

340
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:45,932
That's the point.

341
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:47,232
Yeah, that's the point.

342
00:20:47,232 --> 00:20:49,432
Well, that's a good... Okay, let's move on to the next person then.

343
00:20:50,932 --> 00:20:52,432
Good job.

344
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:53,632
Yeah, nice try.

345
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:55,432
Next person. Who's next?

346
00:20:56,432 --> 00:20:58,432
Whoa, are you ready to go?

347
00:20:58,432 --> 00:21:00,932
After that, you have to show off.

348
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:02,432
Get going. Go on.

349
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:04,432
I'm waiting.

350
00:21:13,432 --> 00:21:14,932
Rissa...

351
00:21:14,932 --> 00:21:17,932
Well, you know...

352
00:21:18,432 --> 00:21:21,232
We've been close for a little while now...

353
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:25,432
It's gone by really fast, right?

354
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:29,932
But we've never really been able to hang out, just the two of us.

355
00:21:29,932 --> 00:21:31,932
You know? Rissa?

356
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:38,932
I think I'd really like it if it was just you and myself.

357
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:41,232
That's what I was thinking.

358
00:21:41,932 --> 00:21:44,932
Maybe we could go... I get...

359
00:21:44,932 --> 00:21:47,432
A massage together?

360
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,432
And then, afterwards...

361
00:21:49,432 --> 00:21:53,432
Once we feel so much more relaxed and free...

362
00:21:55,932 --> 00:21:58,432
We could go to a cafe...

363
00:21:58,432 --> 00:22:01,432
A cafe that's very special to me.

364
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:04,432
Because I know you're a little indecisive too.

365
00:22:06,432 --> 00:22:09,932
And then, we could just chat.

366
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,432
And... more.

367
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,932
More?

368
00:22:15,932 --> 00:22:17,432
That sounds so fun too!

369
00:22:17,432 --> 00:22:20,932
You guys are really speaking to my heart here with these cafes...

370
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:22,932
And dates and stuff.

371
00:22:24,932 --> 00:22:26,932
I like it a lot.

372
00:22:26,932 --> 00:22:30,932
I think we have one more contestant, so Bachelorette number four...

373
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,432
Will you please take the stage?

374
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:34,432
Make it romantic!

375
00:22:34,432 --> 00:22:36,432
*Stomps angrily on the ground*

376
00:22:36,432 --> 00:22:37,932
I wanna go on a date with you!

377
00:22:41,432 --> 00:22:43,432
My lady... *tips fedora*

378
00:22:43,432 --> 00:22:46,932
*Pulls out 10 million dollars in cash*

379
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,632
*Waves it under your nose*

380
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:50,432
This is all for you.

381
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:52,432
And you know what? Not only that...

382
00:22:52,432 --> 00:22:55,432
But I have 10 million roses in the ground right here!

383
00:22:57,432 --> 00:22:59,932
Wait, do we all... don't die?

384
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:01,432
Just like my love for you.

385
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:02,932
That's how it's supposed to be.

386
00:23:02,932 --> 00:23:04,932
You are as beautiful as the moon.

387
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:08,432
So bright, so elegant, so in the night sky.

388
00:23:08,432 --> 00:23:10,432
I love seeing you at night, ma'am.

389
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:12,932
Sorry, what are we doing for this date?

390
00:23:13,432 --> 00:23:14,932
Oh sorry! I forgot about the date!

391
00:23:16,932 --> 00:23:18,432
Go on a date with me though!

392
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:20,432
Okay, you've convinced me.

393
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:24,432
I think all of you have successfully managed to rizz me on a date.

394
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:28,232
So there's our first question.

395
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:30,932
Yay! Come on back!

396
00:23:32,432 --> 00:23:34,432
Let me get my cash again.

397
00:23:38,932 --> 00:23:41,432
I can't tell who my favorite is yet.

398
00:23:41,432 --> 00:23:43,932
I think we're going to need some more questions for me to be able to pick.

399
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:45,932
More? Alright.

400
00:23:45,932 --> 00:23:47,432
There's more?!

401
00:23:48,932 --> 00:23:51,432
Alright, well let's move on to the next question then.

402
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,932
Alright... We successfully asked Nerissa out,

403
00:23:56,932 --> 00:23:58,432
and she happily said yes!

404
00:23:58,432 --> 00:23:59,932
Yay!

405
00:24:00,432 --> 00:24:02,932
Since it's our first date,

406
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:05,232
we want to make her feel special and happy, right?

407
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:06,432
Of course!

408
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:08,932
Well, what kind of surprise do we have in store for our first date?

409
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:10,932
A surprise?

410
00:24:10,932 --> 00:24:12,932
Yeah, I love surprises.

411
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:15,432
I'm looking forward to it.

412
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:19,932
Now the question is... are we gonna continue the story of our first date?

413
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:21,932
Yeah?

414
00:24:21,932 --> 00:24:23,932
Maybe... let's do that.

415
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:25,432
Me?

416
00:24:25,432 --> 00:24:26,432
Okay.

417
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,432
Okay, blindfold back on.

418
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:30,932
Again! Yay!

419
00:24:32,932 --> 00:24:34,932
Alright, I'm ready to be rizzed.

420
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,932
Alright, well we're ready to rizz you.

421
00:24:38,932 --> 00:24:40,932
Let's go in order of rizz then.

422
00:24:40,932 --> 00:24:42,432
Okay, the twins.

423
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:43,932
Here I go!

424
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:45,932
She's so brave.

425
00:24:51,932 --> 00:24:53,932
So then, during our date...

426
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:57,432
While we're walking along the water at night with all the city lights around us...

427
00:24:58,432 --> 00:24:59,932
Suddenly...

428
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,632
You lose sight of me.

429
00:25:01,932 --> 00:25:02,932
Huh?

430
00:25:03,873 --> 00:25:07,273
You feel a bit panicked...

431
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:11,373
and then suddenly, you see a bunch of mascot characters.

432
00:25:11,373 --> 00:25:13,023
Huh?

433
00:25:13,023 --> 00:25:19,673
And they're doing a little bit of a dance. Just un-uh, ah-uh, ah-uh!

434
00:25:19,673 --> 00:25:23,323
And then, all of a sudden, one of them goes...

435
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:24,473
Bwah!

436
00:25:24,473 --> 00:25:26,373
And out comes me!

437
00:25:26,373 --> 00:25:27,623
Ah!

438
00:25:27,623 --> 00:25:29,373
A bit of a surprise!

439
00:25:29,373 --> 00:25:31,073
And ah, I have roses.

440
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:33,473
And I say, you're the character of my life.

441
00:25:33,473 --> 00:25:34,773
For you!

442
00:25:35,473 --> 00:25:36,573
So cute!

443
00:25:37,273 --> 00:25:37,923
Yes!

444
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:42,973
That's so romantic, Bachelor Number One?

445
00:25:43,273 --> 00:25:44,973
Thank you! Romance, yeah!

446
00:25:48,073 --> 00:25:49,173
Okay!

447
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:49,873
Good.

448
00:25:49,873 --> 00:25:51,173
Thank you!

449
00:25:51,173 --> 00:25:51,873
Yeah!

450
00:25:51,873 --> 00:25:52,823
Nice!

451
00:25:52,823 --> 00:25:53,873
All right.

452
00:25:53,873 --> 00:25:55,173
Next up is...

453
00:25:55,173 --> 00:25:56,373
Let's go!

454
00:25:56,373 --> 00:25:58,473
Go on my little rizz champion.

455
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,673
Okay, I got this. Yeah. Steal the mic... okay, well whatever.

456
00:26:03,673 --> 00:26:04,473
So...

457
00:26:05,173 --> 00:26:07,073
How Nerissa hears it...

458
00:26:07,073 --> 00:26:12,373
All right Nerissa. After our date, you know, um, you have to take me home...

459
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:18,773
because I spilled my drink all over myself from being scared 'cause you were comforting me, right?

460
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:22,773
Uh, so afterwards, I take you home to my place.

461
00:26:22,773 --> 00:26:25,673
And you know what we're gonna do? We open the door...

462
00:26:25,673 --> 00:26:27,773
and there's trash everywhere.

463
00:26:27,773 --> 00:26:32,773
And that is my surprise because I know everything about you and I know that you love cleaning.

464
00:26:32,773 --> 00:26:38,173
So, surprise! My room is dirty and you have to clean it.

465
00:26:38,173 --> 00:26:44,273
And you love that so much. And that's so romantic for you. Like, "Yeah woman, clean my house."

466
00:26:44,273 --> 00:26:48,773
And... and I let you. I let you clean my house.

467
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,173
And you... you feel so strong about that.

468
00:26:53,473 --> 00:26:57,473
You know, I do love to clean. Especially for my friends.

469
00:26:57,473 --> 00:27:02,073
However, I think if I was on a romantic date, uh, it would not be at the top of my list.

470
00:27:02,073 --> 00:27:08,073
But... but in... in the trash there's like treasures for you that I put in the trash, like flowers.

471
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:09,023
Oh!

472
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:10,873
There's like... there's flowers...

473
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:12,373
You have to dig for it.

474
00:27:12,373 --> 00:27:15,773
I think I would be turned... I think I would be turned off by that.

475
00:27:15,773 --> 00:27:20,673
I feel like when I found them I might be like, "Oh, that's cute", but I might be a little...

476
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:23,273
You did your best. So let's move on to the next one, how about that?

477
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:26,373
No one understands me! My type of romance!

478
00:27:26,373 --> 00:27:27,573
It's okay!

479
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,573
Okay, who's next?

480
00:27:30,373 --> 00:27:31,373
Did you like it?

481
00:27:31,373 --> 00:27:32,073
Good job.

482
00:27:32,073 --> 00:27:32,873
Thank you.

483
00:27:34,173 --> 00:27:36,273
I'm gonna do my best!

484
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:42,073
Well, you know...

485
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:44,273
here at this cafe...

486
00:27:45,673 --> 00:27:50,273
I guess you're really excited for the cakes that we ordered, right?

487
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:52,173
And...

488
00:27:52,173 --> 00:27:52,873
Well...

489
00:27:53,573 --> 00:27:55,373
I wanted to surprise you.

490
00:27:56,273 --> 00:28:00,373
And I know there's one thing that you love very much.

491
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:01,473
So...

492
00:28:01,773 --> 00:28:03,673
How Nerissa hears it...

493
00:28:02,073 --> 00:28:03,073
Nerissa...

494
00:28:03,673 --> 00:28:05,173
Look me in the eyes.

495
00:28:07,273 --> 00:28:08,573
You see this here?

496
00:28:08,973 --> 00:28:10,473
This is my smartphone.

497
00:28:10,473 --> 00:28:11,273
Bam!

498
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,373
Down on the table.

499
00:28:13,373 --> 00:28:14,373
Today...

500
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:17,073
I'm giving you all my attention.

501
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:19,373
Because you're my princess.

502
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,873
Um, today...

503
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:23,273
It's just you and me.

504
00:28:24,373 --> 00:28:25,673
Whoa...

505
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:29,573
The rest of the world disappears when we're together for you?

506
00:28:29,573 --> 00:28:31,873
That's such a good surprise.

507
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:34,873
I love it so far, Bachelor Number Three!

508
00:28:34,873 --> 00:28:37,673
All right, let's hear the last bachelor, shall we?

509
00:28:37,673 --> 00:28:38,773
That was a good one.

510
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:39,873
Yeah.

511
00:28:39,873 --> 00:28:40,873
Good job.

512
00:28:40,873 --> 00:28:42,873
Yeah I'm sad. I'm sad.

513
00:28:45,973 --> 00:28:46,973
My lady.

514
00:28:47,473 --> 00:28:50,173
As we walk on the moon where our date takes place in...

515
00:28:50,173 --> 00:28:52,673
I reconstructed it from the ground up.

516
00:28:52,673 --> 00:28:56,073
There is an amusement park in your honor, in your name.

517
00:28:56,073 --> 00:28:57,873
Nerissa Ravenland!

518
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:04,473
And there are Jailbirds.

519
00:29:04,473 --> 00:29:06,873
As far as the eye can see.

520
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:11,373
And you... each one serves you to the utmost ability they have.

521
00:29:11,373 --> 00:29:13,873
You can even step on them. That is my surprise.

522
00:29:13,873 --> 00:29:16,573
An entire army just for you. A fat flocks.

523
00:29:16,573 --> 00:29:19,873
Oh my gosh, that is kind of romantic.

524
00:29:19,873 --> 00:29:22,673
Yeah. But they're moon jailbirds.

525
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:26,373
They're moon jailbirds? It's like a whole different species.

526
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:27,473
Are they like, white colored too then?

527
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:29,573
Yes, they're also maybe fatter.

528
00:29:29,573 --> 00:29:30,873
Oh!

529
00:29:30,873 --> 00:29:33,873
Yeah. Fat on my love for you.

530
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:34,873
What?

531
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,273
You feed them with your love?

532
00:29:37,273 --> 00:29:38,373
That's how they survive.

533
00:29:38,373 --> 00:29:41,173
Well, thank you Bachelor Number Four.

534
00:29:41,173 --> 00:29:42,073
No problem.

535
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:42,973
That was awesome.

536
00:29:44,273 --> 00:29:45,973
These are all awesome dates.

537
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:46,873
Wow, even mine?

538
00:29:46,873 --> 00:29:48,073
Oooh...

539
00:29:48,073 --> 00:29:50,273
Well, it was a good attempt.

540
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:55,373
Good job! Yeah! Everyone did so good! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

541
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:58,473
Let's move on to the next question, shall we?

542
00:30:00,273 --> 00:30:01,773
Ah, all right!

543
00:30:01,773 --> 00:30:03,073
Question Number Three!

544
00:30:03,073 --> 00:30:05,173
The surprise was a huge success!

545
00:30:05,173 --> 00:30:07,073
Heart-stirring line

546
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:10,871
Even on this special date...

547
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:15,771
you feel frustrated that the 'just friends' vibe has not gone away yet.

548
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:19,621
Now you want Nerissa to see you more than a friend!

549
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:21,271
And you wanna...

550
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:25,171
You want her to think of you as a... more of like a romantic interest!

551
00:30:25,171 --> 00:30:26,671
So it's time to make your move!

552
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:27,771
How are you gonna do it?

553
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:29,471
Say something to win her heart!

554
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:33,671
Please do win my heart, Advent.

555
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:34,821
Please.

556
00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:37,671
Don't look!

557
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:39,421
Is that possible?

558
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:43,071
I'll put my blindfold back on,

559
00:30:43,071 --> 00:30:45,771
and you guys can come up with...

560
00:30:45,771 --> 00:30:47,871
everything you want to say.

561
00:30:47,871 --> 00:30:49,421
Think, think!

562
00:30:49,421 --> 00:30:51,021
Time to think!

563
00:30:51,021 --> 00:30:53,021
Well, thinking time's over!

564
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:54,821
Bachelor Number One,

565
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:57,071
would you please approach the mic?

566
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,921
Say some what?

567
00:30:57,921 --> 00:30:59,021
Say some what?

568
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:01,021
Say something to make her more than friends!

569
00:31:01,021 --> 00:31:02,221
Oh, I see, I see.

570
00:31:02,221 --> 00:31:03,821
It's my time!

571
00:31:04,771 --> 00:31:06,321
Bachelor Number One!

572
00:31:06,321 --> 00:31:07,571
Bachelor Number One!

573
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:08,671
Go Bill!

574
00:31:08,671 --> 00:31:09,671
Let's go!

575
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:10,671
Yeah.

576
00:31:10,671 --> 00:31:11,421
Um...

577
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:13,171
I'm Bill.

578
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,221
Bill?

579
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,371
Nerissa...

580
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:20,071
You know...

581
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:22,571
we spent a lot of time together.

582
00:31:22,571 --> 00:31:23,221
And...

583
00:31:23,721 --> 00:31:24,721
I think...

584
00:31:24,721 --> 00:31:26,921
I know you pretty well.

585
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:28,221
I would hope that...

586
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:30,121
you would think the same of me.

587
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,271
But...

588
00:31:32,271 --> 00:31:33,421
I feel like...

589
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:34,671
you know...

590
00:31:34,671 --> 00:31:36,771
I'd like to take things...

591
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:38,121
a step further.

592
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:39,421
You know...

593
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:41,071
we're not...

594
00:31:41,071 --> 00:31:42,771
just friends...

595
00:31:42,771 --> 00:31:43,921
anymore, right?

596
00:31:43,921 --> 00:31:44,821
So...

597
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:47,221
Can I...

598
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:51,021
Can I hold your hand?

599
00:31:53,071 --> 00:31:54,071
Please?

600
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:55,171
Princess?

601
00:31:55,171 --> 00:31:57,071
You can... you can hold my hand.

602
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:58,271
If you want to.

603
00:31:58,271 --> 00:31:59,021
I'll...

604
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:00,321
I'll hold your hand.

605
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:05,071
That's enough!

606
00:32:06,321 --> 00:32:07,521
Thank you!

607
00:32:07,521 --> 00:32:08,921
That's so sweet!

608
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:09,971
Hand holding?

609
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:12,321
That's such a big advancement of our relationship.

610
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:13,671
But I'd still like to hear...

611
00:32:13,671 --> 00:32:15,771
Bachelor Number Two.

612
00:32:15,771 --> 00:32:16,671
Good luck.

613
00:32:16,671 --> 00:32:17,571
You got this.

614
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:18,321
Trash!

615
00:32:18,321 --> 00:32:19,221
You got this.

616
00:32:19,221 --> 00:32:20,021
Trash!

617
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,021
Trust.

618
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:23,271
Trash.

619
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:24,171
You're trash.

620
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:25,171
Don't be trash.

621
00:32:25,171 --> 00:32:26,271
Just do a story.

622
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:28,771
Go William!

623
00:32:28,771 --> 00:32:30,171
I'm William.

624
00:32:34,671 --> 00:32:36,071
Alright, baby...

625
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:37,671
I'm coming over here...

626
00:32:38,121 --> 00:32:39,121
What?

627
00:32:39,121 --> 00:32:40,121
What?

628
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:41,071
Whoa!

629
00:32:41,071 --> 00:32:42,171
Wait!

630
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:43,721
Is this...?

631
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:45,321
You hear me in your ear, right?

632
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:46,121
Yeah.

633
00:32:46,121 --> 00:32:47,521
Smell me right now.

634
00:32:47,521 --> 00:32:49,421
She smells like trash!

635
00:32:49,421 --> 00:32:51,021
I smell good! I smell good!

636
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:53,171
That's the pheromones, baby.

637
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,721
That means you're attracted to me.

638
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:55,721
The pheromones!

639
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:57,371
If you think I smell good too,

640
00:32:57,371 --> 00:32:58,871
that means you like me so much.

641
00:32:58,871 --> 00:33:00,321
You're so attracted to me.

642
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:02,971
So I think we should take our relationship to the next level.

643
00:33:02,971 --> 00:33:04,021
What do you say?

644
00:33:04,021 --> 00:33:05,121
You're too close!

645
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:06,321
Is that a yes?

646
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:08,021
Baby...

647
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:08,921
Is that a yes?

648
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:09,971
Yes or no?

649
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:10,871
Baby...

650
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:14,471
I kind of... I enjoy that aggressiveness a little bit I think.

651
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:15,321
Yeah.

652
00:33:15,321 --> 00:33:16,221
Oh!

653
00:33:16,221 --> 00:33:17,571
Good, good!

654
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:20,021
It's, it's...

655
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:21,521
Your hands looked deadly.

656
00:33:22,521 --> 00:33:25,171
Maybe just a little forceful, maybe just a little sudden.

657
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:26,771
'Cause in your dirty... in your dirty room...

658
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,171
with all your dirty trash...

659
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:30,121
and your dirty flowers underneath the trash...

660
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:33,471
I don't know, like I feel like it might be a little bit disgusting.

661
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:35,321
When it's just you and me baby,

662
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:38,121
in the moment you will forget about everything.

663
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:39,121
I see.

664
00:33:39,121 --> 00:33:41,871
Well let's move on to Bachelor Number Three.

665
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:43,071
You can do this.

666
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:43,971
You can do it.

667
00:33:47,221 --> 00:33:48,221
What's her name?

668
00:33:48,221 --> 00:33:49,421
Go Matilda!

669
00:33:49,421 --> 00:33:50,471
Matilda?

670
00:33:50,471 --> 00:33:51,671
Matilda!

671
00:33:51,671 --> 00:33:52,821
Why was I Bill?

672
00:33:52,821 --> 00:33:53,921
Why not?

673
00:33:58,271 --> 00:34:00,121
Nerissa...

674
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:04,021
We had some very nice times together.

675
00:34:04,021 --> 00:34:05,771
Just you and me.

676
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:06,671
And...

677
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:08,071
Well...

678
00:34:09,821 --> 00:34:11,721
You know we're genmates but...

679
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:14,221
to me...

680
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:16,221
we're a lot more than that.

681
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:19,321
You know...

682
00:34:19,321 --> 00:34:20,671
Every time...

683
00:34:20,671 --> 00:34:21,921
I sent you...

684
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:23,371
one of those pictures...

685
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:27,021
that... maybe showed a bit too...

686
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:29,221
That was just me and you.

687
00:34:32,221 --> 00:34:33,471
There was a reason behind that.

688
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,671
And...

689
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:36,521
well...

690
00:34:37,621 --> 00:34:39,921
today I'd like you to know that.

691
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,571
So...

692
00:34:43,421 --> 00:34:46,171
um... I'm waiting for your answer, okay?

693
00:34:48,271 --> 00:34:49,421
Cute!

694
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,471
It's so innocent too!

695
00:34:54,071 --> 00:34:55,471
Thank you, Bachelor Number Three!

696
00:34:57,371 --> 00:34:58,171
Good job!

697
00:34:59,071 --> 00:35:01,471
Alright, we have just one bachelor left.

698
00:35:01,471 --> 00:35:03,171
Bachelor Number Four,

699
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:04,471
will you take the mic?

700
00:35:15,496 --> 00:35:17,646
Nerissa, my dearest...

701
00:35:18,646 --> 00:35:21,396
I like you more than a friend.

702
00:35:25,346 --> 00:35:28,246
Even... I don't know how you feel about me...

703
00:35:28,846 --> 00:35:30,846
And regardless of who you choose...

704
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:32,396
Whatever makes you happy...

705
00:35:32,646 --> 00:35:33,896
I will honor it.

706
00:35:33,996 --> 00:35:37,846
And I will hope that you will always be happy with that person.

707
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:39,896
Whether it is the beautiful Matilda...

708
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,346
The other people I've named and forgot I named...

709
00:35:44,146 --> 00:35:45,646
You're just so wonderful...

710
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:47,396
And your smile is precious.

711
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:49,796
*Tips fedora*

712
00:35:50,096 --> 00:35:54,446
Walk away with my 10 million dollars of cash depending on how you answer!

713
00:35:54,646 --> 00:35:55,646
Oh my gosh!

714
00:35:56,046 --> 00:35:57,246
So sweet!

715
00:35:57,796 --> 00:35:59,196
That was so earnest too, wait.

716
00:35:59,296 --> 00:36:02,446
I wasn't expecting that from you, Bachelor Number 4, Steve.

717
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:06,296
No one ever expects that with a person with 10 million dollars.

718
00:36:06,546 --> 00:36:07,246
No.

719
00:36:08,896 --> 00:36:09,746
Well how sweet.

720
00:36:09,846 --> 00:36:11,046
You guys all did so good!

721
00:36:11,396 --> 00:36:13,646
I feel my heart racing for sure!

722
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:17,496
So, which one made your heart skip a beat the most, huh?

723
00:36:18,496 --> 00:36:21,796
Well, the honest answer of who made my heart...

724
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,296
STOP...

725
00:36:25,346 --> 00:36:27,646
...would be Bachelor Number 2.

726
00:36:28,196 --> 00:36:29,646
I take that as a win.

727
00:36:29,746 --> 00:36:30,646
That's pretty good!

728
00:36:30,846 --> 00:36:32,396
But I don't... it's difficult to say.

729
00:36:33,596 --> 00:36:34,846
It's difficult!

730
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:39,146
Again, it's still hard to pick.

731
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:42,396
I think we have to ask a few more questions before I can settle on one of you.

732
00:36:42,546 --> 00:36:43,296
One more!?

733
00:36:43,746 --> 00:36:44,796
Yes, two more questions.

734
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:47,146
So, shall we read off the next one?

735
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:49,796
Okay! Let's go to the fourth question then!

736
00:36:50,096 --> 00:36:50,696
Okay.

737
00:36:51,196 --> 00:36:51,896
Okay.

738
00:36:52,496 --> 00:36:55,096
The sweet days you longed for...

739
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:56,496
With Nerissa...

740
00:36:57,246 --> 00:37:01,246
It's been two years since you finally confessed your love.

741
00:37:01,396 --> 00:37:02,446
Two years!

742
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:03,546
And...

743
00:37:03,696 --> 00:37:06,496
Embraced something truly special between the two of you.

744
00:37:07,196 --> 00:37:08,396
Everything seemed perfect.

745
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:10,996
Like a dream you never wanted to end!

746
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,396
But...

747
00:37:12,996 --> 00:37:14,996
A tiny mistake on your part...

748
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:17,746
Sparked a huge fight between the two of you!

749
00:37:18,646 --> 00:37:20,146
With all your heart...

750
00:37:20,396 --> 00:37:22,746
Apologize for the wrong you've done...

751
00:37:23,046 --> 00:37:26,896
And strive together to overcome this trial that threatens your love!

752
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:28,696
Okay...

753
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:29,646
Got it.

754
00:37:29,896 --> 00:37:31,646
So we've been dating for two years...

755
00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:33,896
And you guys have upset me.

756
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:35,246
Crisis!

757
00:37:35,646 --> 00:37:38,296
So, won't you please apologize and make it all better?

758
00:37:39,096 --> 00:37:41,246
I'll put my blindfold back on.

759
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:44,146
So make things right between us, okay, you four?

760
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,696
Two years...

761
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:47,696
Two years is pretty serious.

762
00:37:52,346 --> 00:37:54,446
Alright, Bachelor Number 1, it's your turn.

763
00:37:54,996 --> 00:37:55,596
Okay.

764
00:37:56,296 --> 00:37:57,446
Here I go!

765
00:38:05,596 --> 00:38:06,496
Nerissa...

766
00:38:07,946 --> 00:38:08,996
I'm sorry...

767
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,646
I know I hurt you, very deeply...

768
00:38:12,946 --> 00:38:13,946
With all my...

769
00:38:16,746 --> 00:38:18,496
Well, it wasn't meant to be like this...

770
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:21,246
But ultimately, it turned out this way.

771
00:38:22,346 --> 00:38:22,896
My...

772
00:38:23,546 --> 00:38:24,796
Indecisiveness...

773
00:38:25,796 --> 00:38:26,196
My...

774
00:38:26,946 --> 00:38:28,396
Lack of action...

775
00:38:29,546 --> 00:38:30,296
I know...

776
00:38:31,096 --> 00:38:34,346
That you, the love of my life...

777
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:37,296
I should have done it.

778
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:40,146
I should have... already proposed to you!

779
00:38:40,596 --> 00:38:42,396
Already have made you...

780
00:38:42,646 --> 00:38:44,696
Long before, but...

781
00:38:46,396 --> 00:38:48,196
I'm sorry for hurting you this way.

782
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:50,146
For hurting you at your core...

783
00:38:50,346 --> 00:38:52,246
In your heart, so deeply.

784
00:38:53,246 --> 00:38:54,246
Could you ever...

785
00:38:54,846 --> 00:38:56,146
Forgive me?

786
00:38:56,696 --> 00:38:57,796
What a cutie!

787
00:38:57,846 --> 00:38:59,496
Still Bachelor Number 1.

788
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:02,446
You managed to be so earnest and sweet!

789
00:39:02,796 --> 00:39:04,646
You're really reaching to my heart.

790
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:08,696
Let's move on to Bachelor Number 2 and see what sort of answer they're going to give.

791
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:09,346
Good job champ.

792
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:09,996
Good job champ!

793
00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:11,046
Yeah!

794
00:39:21,696 --> 00:39:22,546
Hey Nerissa.

795
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:25,996
I know I was gaming with the boys...

796
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:28,396
And then you walked in...

797
00:39:28,796 --> 00:39:30,196
And you wanted attention.

798
00:39:30,346 --> 00:39:30,996
And I was like...

799
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:32,046
"Five minutes!"

800
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:33,346
"I can't pause the game!"

801
00:39:33,396 --> 00:39:34,846
"It's an online game Nerissa!"

802
00:39:34,996 --> 00:39:35,496
But...

803
00:39:35,846 --> 00:39:37,846
And then you went away crying...

804
00:39:38,296 --> 00:39:40,796
But after the gaming session...

805
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,046
I was like "hmm..."

806
00:39:42,396 --> 00:39:44,146
"Maybe I did do something wrong..."

807
00:39:45,046 --> 00:39:46,296
"Maybe I should have..."

808
00:39:46,946 --> 00:39:48,796
"Maybe I should have invited her to play a game with me."

809
00:39:49,146 --> 00:39:50,096
So...

810
00:39:50,196 --> 00:39:51,196
I'm gonna do something...

811
00:39:51,346 --> 00:39:53,196
That I've never done ever once in my life.

812
00:39:53,346 --> 00:39:54,246
I've never done this before.

813
00:39:55,046 --> 00:39:56,046
Apologize!

814
00:39:58,246 --> 00:39:59,846
I've never apologized to anyone ever!

815
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:02,096
And I'm gonna apologize to you now...

816
00:40:02,246 --> 00:40:02,996
So listen.

817
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:07,094
I want to be your Player Two.

818
00:40:07,944 --> 00:40:10,344
I'll play with you instead of the boys.

819
00:40:10,794 --> 00:40:12,444
Come here babygirl.

820
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:13,394
Yeah.

821
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:15,594
That's... I think that's good, Bachelor Number Two.

822
00:40:15,594 --> 00:40:17,494
Let's move on to Bachelor Number Three.

823
00:40:17,494 --> 00:40:18,644
Does she love that?

824
00:40:20,144 --> 00:40:21,344
Thank you.

825
00:40:22,944 --> 00:40:25,344
Alright, Bachelor Number Three to the mic, please.

826
00:40:32,144 --> 00:40:33,044
Hey.

827
00:40:35,244 --> 00:40:36,044
I know...

828
00:40:36,544 --> 00:40:39,544
Things have been a little weird recently, huh?

829
00:40:40,694 --> 00:40:41,544
But...

830
00:40:43,244 --> 00:40:45,044
I wanted to say something.

831
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,144
Nerissa...

832
00:40:49,244 --> 00:40:50,544
I'm sorry.

833
00:40:51,844 --> 00:40:52,644
I know...

834
00:40:53,394 --> 00:40:54,144
You know...

835
00:40:54,644 --> 00:40:56,444
Maybe I was acting a little childish.

836
00:40:57,444 --> 00:40:59,044
I kept on saying things...

837
00:41:00,244 --> 00:41:01,844
Like... you're stinky.

838
00:41:02,844 --> 00:41:03,544
And then...

839
00:41:04,144 --> 00:41:04,844
You know...

840
00:41:05,444 --> 00:41:07,744
Maybe you took that personally, but...

841
00:41:08,794 --> 00:41:10,644
It's just... I was teasing you...

842
00:41:11,944 --> 00:41:13,344
Because I love you!

843
00:41:14,294 --> 00:41:16,744
I love you Nerissa Ravencroft!

844
00:41:18,494 --> 00:41:19,694
And I'm sorry.

845
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:22,294
And I just wanted to say...

846
00:41:23,744 --> 00:41:24,394
Is that...

847
00:41:25,094 --> 00:41:25,944
You're stinky.

848
00:41:26,744 --> 00:41:27,244
But...

849
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:29,144
I love it.

850
00:41:29,694 --> 00:41:30,944
I love your stink!

851
00:41:32,644 --> 00:41:34,094
That's enough.

852
00:41:34,744 --> 00:41:38,144
Let's move to the last bachelor, Bachelor Number Four.

853
00:41:38,444 --> 00:41:39,344
That was pretty good.

854
00:41:39,494 --> 00:41:40,294
What the heck?

855
00:41:40,694 --> 00:41:42,344
What a beautiful stench.

856
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:44,844
Okay.

857
00:41:45,344 --> 00:41:46,144
Last one.

858
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:52,594
Hey Nerissa.

859
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,994
It's me, one of the boys.

860
00:41:57,444 --> 00:41:59,944
I just wanted to say I'm sorry that...

861
00:42:00,544 --> 00:42:04,944
The other person and I were gaming instead of giving you attention.

862
00:42:05,444 --> 00:42:06,044
Hello?

863
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:10,944
We were just having so much fun playing games together.

864
00:42:11,294 --> 00:42:12,844
I should have been focused on you.

865
00:42:14,194 --> 00:42:15,594
I'm crying right now.

866
00:42:18,394 --> 00:42:19,694
I'm just so sorry.

867
00:42:19,894 --> 00:42:21,644
I'm so sorry as one of the boys.

868
00:42:22,744 --> 00:42:24,844
This is your feet and apology.

869
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:26,244
Th-Thank you?

870
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:29,394
I guess in your universe I have two boyfriends?

871
00:42:29,694 --> 00:42:31,794
I'm dating both you and Bachelor Number Two.

872
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:33,744
I forgive you for that too by the way.

873
00:42:33,744 --> 00:42:34,894
I forgive you.

874
00:42:35,544 --> 00:42:37,744
Oh, very understanding lovers.

875
00:42:38,244 --> 00:42:40,394
It's understandable, we were gaming too hard.

876
00:42:40,544 --> 00:42:41,294
It was so good.

877
00:42:41,744 --> 00:42:42,794
It was pretty hot.

878
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:44,194
That's a good game right here.

879
00:42:46,544 --> 00:42:49,394
Well, I think I'm getting closer to my answer.

880
00:42:49,844 --> 00:42:52,844
Of what one of these lovely bachelors I'm going to pick.

881
00:42:53,544 --> 00:42:57,244
But I think we're going to maybe need one... one more question?

882
00:42:57,444 --> 00:42:58,094
One more?

883
00:42:58,294 --> 00:42:58,844
Okay.

884
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:01,594
Wow, let's move on to the final question.

885
00:43:03,044 --> 00:43:06,294
And after this one, Nerissa makes her decision...

886
00:43:06,944 --> 00:43:08,994
About who she chooses, so Nerissa...

887
00:43:09,244 --> 00:43:09,944
Ah?

888
00:43:10,844 --> 00:43:12,844
Please answer carefully, okay?

889
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:14,944
Choose from the heart, okay?

890
00:43:15,194 --> 00:43:16,494
I will, from the heart.

891
00:43:17,144 --> 00:43:18,144
From the heart!

892
00:43:18,644 --> 00:43:21,744
Yeah, in fact, Nerissa why don't you read the final question...

893
00:43:21,844 --> 00:43:23,244
So you can finally see.

894
00:43:23,444 --> 00:43:24,644
Oh, okay.

895
00:43:24,844 --> 00:43:27,244
Question Number Five: My Eternity.

896
00:43:27,644 --> 00:43:28,344
Oh!

897
00:43:28,744 --> 00:43:30,594
This is your moment, Bachelors.

898
00:43:30,994 --> 00:43:33,794
Make the ultimate marriage proposal to me.

899
00:43:35,244 --> 00:43:36,244
Huh?

900
00:43:37,344 --> 00:43:39,594
I've never made a marriage proposal before.

901
00:43:40,144 --> 00:43:41,094
Marriage proposal?

902
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:42,744
Now is the time.

903
00:43:43,244 --> 00:43:45,344
So let me put my blindfold back on.

904
00:43:45,644 --> 00:43:48,144
And I'm looking forward to seeing your answers, or hearing them.

905
00:43:48,344 --> 00:43:50,644
Two years and she still can't see us.

906
00:43:51,644 --> 00:43:52,444
Um...

907
00:43:52,844 --> 00:43:54,094
You know... ah...

908
00:43:54,494 --> 00:43:58,194
The marriage proposal, should we really be going to the mic?

909
00:43:58,644 --> 00:43:59,394
Oh.

910
00:43:59,644 --> 00:44:00,444
Ah.

911
00:44:01,044 --> 00:44:02,944
I guess you guys can do whatever you'd like.

912
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:05,144
Bachelor Number One, will you approach?

913
00:44:06,794 --> 00:44:07,944
Slowly.

914
00:44:08,644 --> 00:44:09,744
Thinking.

915
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:11,394
Slowly.

916
00:44:12,144 --> 00:44:13,044
Thinking.

917
00:44:15,144 --> 00:44:17,494
Bachelor Number One, do not love me or something?

918
00:44:17,744 --> 00:44:18,494
Where are you?

919
00:44:18,744 --> 00:44:20,144
It's such a special day.

920
00:44:20,244 --> 00:44:22,744
We've been out to dinner at my favorite restaurant.

921
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:26,094
Are you standing me up on such a special day?

922
00:44:29,344 --> 00:44:30,244
Um...

923
00:44:41,744 --> 00:44:44,194
Nerissa Ravencroft... yes?

924
00:44:45,994 --> 00:44:47,144
What's so funny?

925
00:44:50,144 --> 00:44:51,844
Will you marry me?

926
00:44:54,344 --> 00:44:55,044
Yes.

927
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,444
Just like that?

928
00:44:57,644 --> 00:44:58,544
Just like that?

929
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:00,044
Please?

930
00:45:09,219 --> 00:45:11,219
I mean, we've been dating for two years!

931
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:12,019
What do you mean?

932
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:13,419
We're getting married!

933
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,319
Bachelor Number 2!

934
00:45:15,819 --> 00:45:16,619
Oh.

935
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:19,419
Just let that go, bro.

936
00:45:19,419 --> 00:45:20,119
Yeah...

937
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:28,019
Boom.

938
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:30,119
I toss something on the ground. Pick it up.

939
00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:32,819
I know you're blindfolded, pick it up anyway.

940
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:33,619
Pick it up.

941
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:35,819
What?

942
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:36,819
Go.

943
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:38,819
Oh my god!

944
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:43,319
What is going on?

945
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,119
It was a ring!

946
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:47,519
I put a ring on your finger!

947
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:49,319
We're engaged!

948
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:51,319
It looks like plastic!

949
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:52,819
We're engaged now!

950
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:54,819
That's the wrong hand!

951
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:58,319
I will marry you!

952
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:00,319
Get out of here!

953
00:46:00,819 --> 00:46:02,319
We're married!

954
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:03,519
Get out!

955
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:05,119
We're married!

956
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:08,819
That was so scary.

957
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:09,819
I'm so scared.

958
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,819
Gotta go comfort her now.

959
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,819
Yeah, please, no more harassment, Bachelors.

960
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,319
Let's move on to Bachelor Number 2...

961
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,119
Wait, Bachelor Number 3.

962
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:22,819
Bachelor Number 3, please.

963
00:46:32,419 --> 00:46:35,119
Many seasons have passed...

964
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,519
...since we met.

965
00:46:37,819 --> 00:46:39,319
Many memories.

966
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:41,319
Hard times.

967
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,319
Beautiful times.

968
00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:48,119
Many tears we shed together while we watched the sun rise.

969
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:52,319
I'd like to spend many more sunrises...

970
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,119
...and sunsets together.

971
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,819
Will you be my... everything?

972
00:46:57,319 --> 00:46:58,119
Yes.

973
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:00,819
Aw, that is so sweet!

974
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,819
Bachelor Number 3, you're so sweet!

975
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,819
I don't feel like I should clap.

976
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:09,319
All right.

977
00:47:09,419 --> 00:47:10,319
You don't have to.

978
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:13,819
We have one more contestant. Bachelor Number 4.

979
00:47:13,819 --> 00:47:15,319
Would you please... approach?

980
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:16,319
What?

981
00:47:16,819 --> 00:47:17,819
What?

982
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:23,819
What's going on?

983
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:27,119
My bro.

984
00:47:27,319 --> 00:47:27,919
Yes?

985
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,319
You are like the bro-est of my life.

986
00:47:30,819 --> 00:47:32,319
Eh- what the heck is going on?

987
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:33,319
Thanks.

988
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:35,319
We've been gaming for like two years, bro.

989
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,519
Yeah bro, we have been.

990
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:37,119
I know.

991
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:38,819
Wow.

992
00:47:39,819 --> 00:47:41,819
I love playing shooting games with you.

993
00:47:41,919 --> 00:47:42,519
Hello?

994
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,319
You are my number two.

995
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:45,819
Or my number one even.

996
00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:47,119
I'll be your number two, bro.

997
00:47:47,319 --> 00:47:47,919
Hello?

998
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,119
Wow.

999
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:49,819
Yeah.

1000
00:47:49,819 --> 00:47:50,819
I just love you so much, my bro.

1001
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:51,819
Whoa, thanks, bro.

1002
00:47:51,819 --> 00:47:52,819
Yeah.

1003
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,119
Will you marry me?

1004
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:54,919
What?!

1005
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:57,319
Well, I think I'm disqualified.

1006
00:47:57,319 --> 00:47:58,319
Yeah.

1007
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,519
Bachelor Number 4...

1008
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:02,519
Get out of here!

1009
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:05,319
Oh my god.

1010
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,319
Oh my god.

1011
00:48:09,819 --> 00:48:11,819
And with that, the questions are through.

1012
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:12,819
Oh.

1013
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:13,819
Oh.

1014
00:48:13,819 --> 00:48:14,819
She can come to the wedding though.

1015
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:17,819
We've had some awesome... maybe if you can call it that...

1016
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,119
...love stories born.

1017
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:20,519
Some good, some bad.

1018
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:24,819
From one to four, whose story did you like the most?

1019
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:29,319
Please reveal the number, Number One!

1020
00:48:29,319 --> 00:48:30,819
Who is the most romantic?

1021
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,819
I'm gonna go backwards actually.

1022
00:48:32,919 --> 00:48:33,819
Drum roll!

1023
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,819
I think it's obvious which bachelor did NOT steal my heart today.

1024
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,319
Oh...

1025
00:48:39,819 --> 00:48:40,819
That way, huh?

1026
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,319
Okay, drum roll...

1027
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,319
Bachelor Number 2, step forward.

1028
00:48:45,819 --> 00:48:47,119
You are disqualified!

1029
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:48,519
Get out of here!

1030
00:48:52,819 --> 00:48:54,319
Bachelor Number 4, step forward.

1031
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,319
Oh.

1032
00:48:55,819 --> 00:48:57,119
You are disqualified!

1033
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,119
Get out of here!

1034
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:02,319
Somehow I feel like I knew it was you two.

1035
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,319
I don't know what you're talking about.

1036
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,319
Come on, wifey.

1037
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:10,119
This is the hard part now.

1038
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,819
I'm between Bachelor Number 1 and Bachelor Number 3.

1039
00:49:13,819 --> 00:49:16,119
Who stole my heart the most?

1040
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,819
Was it the earnest Bachelor Number 1...

1041
00:49:18,819 --> 00:49:21,819
...or the very sweet Bachelor Number 3 who seemed to know me best?

1042
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:25,319
Ah, I can't decide.

1043
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,319
But if I had to pick between this impossible decision...

1044
00:49:31,819 --> 00:49:33,819
I'd have to pick... Bachelor Number 3!

1045
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:38,819
What does this mean?!

1046
00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:41,319
It's okay!

1047
00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:42,519
You can join us here.

1048
00:49:42,819 --> 00:49:44,819
It's okay! We're married!

1049
00:49:46,819 --> 00:49:47,819
You are the bride!

1050
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,319
No!

1051
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,819
But I must say, knowing that each of you thought so deeply...

1052
00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:54,319
...about a life with me...

1053
00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:56,319
...except some of you maybe.

1054
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:00,319
It makes me feel so special on my special day.

1055
00:50:00,819 --> 00:50:03,319
So thank you for warming my heart.

1056
00:50:07,407 --> 00:50:09,707
Happy Birthday!

1057
00:50:13,507 --> 00:50:15,707
Happy Birthday, I guess.

1058
00:50:22,007 --> 00:50:22,907
Rissa...

1059
00:50:23,207 --> 00:50:24,907
You're so fluffy.

1060
00:50:30,407 --> 00:50:31,407
I love you.

1061
00:50:31,407 --> 00:50:32,007
I love you.

1062
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:33,907
Bau bau...

1063
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:35,907
Bau bau...

1064
00:50:37,307 --> 00:50:38,807
Bau bau forever.

1065
00:50:39,107 --> 00:50:39,707
Bau bau.

1066
00:51:04,707 --> 00:51:07,407
Ah... What a wonderful birthday this is.

1067
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:10,407
I've even found a wonderful partner.

1068
00:51:11,307 --> 00:51:15,607
It feels like this next year of my life is going to be so amazing.

1069
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:18,107
I know, right baby? Hehehe.

1070
00:51:19,807 --> 00:51:21,307
Hey! The blind date's over.

1071
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:25,107
Snap back to reality. Let's play Twister!

1072
00:51:25,107 --> 00:51:26,407
Oh! Yeah!

1073
00:51:27,107 --> 00:51:30,407
Ah, I got Twister ready so we can all play together.

1074
00:51:31,307 --> 00:51:35,107
Looking at it, it might be a bit tricky for all five of us to play at once though.

1075
00:51:35,607 --> 00:51:37,007
Yeah, I think you might be right.

1076
00:51:37,307 --> 00:51:38,507
What should we do then?

1077
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:41,207
Umm... Well, how about to make it fun,

1078
00:51:41,507 --> 00:51:43,007
we can play one at a time.

1079
00:51:43,407 --> 00:51:44,807
You know what? Actually,

1080
00:51:45,107 --> 00:51:47,007
I've just thought of a special rule for today.

1081
00:51:47,307 --> 00:51:48,407
Let's call the game...

1082
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:50,507
Posing Twister!

1083
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,707
Posing Twister! Whoa!

1084
00:51:53,707 --> 00:51:55,107
As the name suggests,

1085
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:58,507
the rule is to strike poses while playing Twister.

1086
00:51:59,107 --> 00:52:00,807
For example, if the instruction says

1087
00:52:01,007 --> 00:52:03,107
'Right hand on red, and cat pose',

1088
00:52:03,407 --> 00:52:06,407
you place your right hand on red and do the cat pose.

1089
00:52:07,307 --> 00:52:09,007
Once all four limbs are in position,

1090
00:52:09,307 --> 00:52:12,407
you can move just one limb to strike the specific pose.

1091
00:52:13,007 --> 00:52:14,807
The time limit will be one minute.

1092
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:17,407
And if you can keep your balance for the full minute,

1093
00:52:17,607 --> 00:52:19,007
you can clear the challenge.

1094
00:52:19,607 --> 00:52:21,607
But, if you lose your balance at any point,

1095
00:52:21,907 --> 00:52:22,807
the game is over.

1096
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,207
Quick question!

1097
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:24,907
Yes?

1098
00:52:25,207 --> 00:52:26,807
Can the audience mess with the player?

1099
00:52:27,107 --> 00:52:28,607
Huh? Yeah, why not?

1100
00:52:29,007 --> 00:52:30,407
So, who wants to go first?

1101
00:52:31,307 --> 00:52:33,007
What? Uh... well we were just playing,

1102
00:52:33,207 --> 00:52:34,407
so somebody else go first.

1103
00:52:34,907 --> 00:52:36,307
Yeah, someone go first. Okay.

1104
00:52:36,607 --> 00:52:38,207
I guess I'll go first... okay.

1105
00:52:38,807 --> 00:52:41,207
Watch out! Okay! Do your best Mococo-chan!

1106
00:52:41,507 --> 00:52:43,007
I'll show you how it's done, okay?

1107
00:52:43,107 --> 00:52:44,307
Do your best, yeah!

1108
00:52:44,707 --> 00:52:46,007
I'll try my best to distract you.

1109
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,107
I'll have fun!

1110
00:52:48,107 --> 00:52:49,807
I've never played Twister before.

1111
00:52:50,107 --> 00:52:51,207
It's your first time then?

1112
00:52:53,107 --> 00:52:54,807
Well, you got one minute. Okay?

1113
00:52:55,107 --> 00:52:56,007
Do your best.

1114
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,007
You ready? Then let's start!

1115
00:52:59,207 --> 00:52:59,707
Go!

1116
00:53:02,107 --> 00:53:02,907
First up!

1117
00:53:03,107 --> 00:53:06,007
Left foot on green, and wolf pose!

1118
00:53:06,607 --> 00:53:08,107
Awoooo!

1119
00:53:11,007 --> 00:53:12,107
Okay, next.

1120
00:53:12,307 --> 00:53:14,407
Right hand on red, and cat pose!

1121
00:53:14,807 --> 00:53:16,607
Wait, isn't that pretty fast for a first timer?

1122
00:53:16,807 --> 00:53:17,807
Faster! Faster!

1123
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,907
Nya!

1124
00:53:21,207 --> 00:53:23,307
Left foot on blue, cow pose!

1125
00:53:24,007 --> 00:53:24,607
Cow?

1126
00:53:24,907 --> 00:53:26,407
Moo...

1127
00:53:26,907 --> 00:53:28,907
Moo...

1128
00:53:34,007 --> 00:53:36,307
Right hand on red, hero pose!

1129
00:53:36,607 --> 00:53:38,107
Wait, I thought my right hand is on red?

1130
00:53:41,707 --> 00:53:43,007
Right hand on red again?

1131
00:53:45,107 --> 00:53:46,407
Hero pose!

1132
00:53:48,107 --> 00:53:50,407
Left hand on yellow, happy pose!

1133
00:53:52,407 --> 00:53:54,107
Happy! Happy happy!

1134
00:53:55,207 --> 00:53:58,107
Now place your left foot on yellow and express anger!

1135
00:53:58,507 --> 00:53:59,707
I'm furious!

1136
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:01,507
So much rage!

1137
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:04,507
Right hand on blue...

1138
00:54:09,007 --> 00:54:11,407
It feels like I'm gonna split apart!

1139
00:54:14,807 --> 00:54:15,907
You did so good!

1140
00:54:16,107 --> 00:54:19,407
All right, Mococo! You passed with flying colors!

1141
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:29,107
All right, who's next? Mococo?

1142
00:54:30,007 --> 00:54:31,407
Um... well...

1143
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:34,707
Biboo! You're next

1144
00:54:34,907 --> 00:54:36,707
because you made fun of me at the beginning.

1145
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,807
Okay! I'll do it then!

1146
00:54:40,007 --> 00:54:43,407
Because of that, I'm going to be your biggest distraction, okay?

1147
00:54:44,007 --> 00:54:44,707
Okay.

1148
00:54:44,807 --> 00:54:46,907
How about I tell Biboo what to do then?

1149
00:54:49,907 --> 00:54:50,907
All right, let's start!

1150
00:54:51,207 --> 00:54:52,707
Right foot on blue,

1151
00:54:52,907 --> 00:54:54,707
graceful Queen Pose!

1152
00:54:56,907 --> 00:54:57,907
Oh my...

1153
00:54:59,107 --> 00:55:00,907
Okay, Miss Elizabeth Roseblood Flame...

1154
00:55:01,828 --> 00:55:03,828
Left foot on blue, lion pose!

1155
00:55:03,828 --> 00:55:05,328
Now do a lion pose.

1156
00:55:05,828 --> 00:55:08,828
Roar! Rawr!

1157
00:55:10,428 --> 00:55:11,828
Left hand on red...

1158
00:55:13,128 --> 00:55:14,828
Give me a rabbit pose.

1159
00:55:14,928 --> 00:55:15,928
Rabbit?

1160
00:55:15,928 --> 00:55:17,128
What does a rabbit say?

1161
00:55:17,128 --> 00:55:18,928
Figure it out, I'm not a rabbit!

1162
00:55:18,928 --> 00:55:20,228
Peko!

1163
00:55:20,228 --> 00:55:21,328
Peko!

1164
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:24,828
Now place your right foot on green...

1165
00:55:26,828 --> 00:55:28,228
...and go Bau Bau!

1166
00:55:28,228 --> 00:55:30,328
Bau bau!

1167
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:32,328
Bau bau! Bau bau!

1168
00:55:32,828 --> 00:55:34,328
Left foot on red...

1169
00:55:35,328 --> 00:55:36,628
..."grr" pose!

1170
00:55:37,828 --> 00:55:39,528
Now give us your best "grr" pose!

1171
00:55:39,528 --> 00:55:42,828
Grrr...

1172
00:55:44,328 --> 00:55:45,628
Right hand on blue...

1173
00:55:45,628 --> 00:55:46,628
Okay.

1174
00:55:46,828 --> 00:55:49,328
Now kawaii! Go kawaii!

1175
00:55:50,328 --> 00:55:51,828
Haa? Kawaii desho?
Huh? I'm cute right?

1176
00:55:51,828 --> 00:55:54,328
Kawaii kara yurushite.
Forgive me because I'm cute.

1177
00:55:54,328 --> 00:55:55,828
Good enough for me.

1178
00:55:57,828 --> 00:55:58,828
Did I win?

1179
00:55:58,828 --> 00:56:00,328
You didn't lose your balance...

1180
00:56:00,328 --> 00:56:04,828
...but I didn't think that was a very cute poser at the end. What about you guys?

1181
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:05,828
No...

1182
00:56:05,828 --> 00:56:06,828
Wasn't good enough.

1183
00:56:06,828 --> 00:56:09,828
But, you did your best, so good job!

1184
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:11,328
Yay!

1185
00:56:15,328 --> 00:56:17,328
Alright, you pick who's next Biboo.

1186
00:56:17,328 --> 00:56:19,328
Ah... okay Shiori, you go next.

1187
00:56:19,328 --> 00:56:20,828
Okay, tell me what to do.

1188
00:56:21,328 --> 00:56:22,828
Alright, boss me around.

1189
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:26,828
Okay Shiori... are you ready?

1190
00:56:26,828 --> 00:56:28,328
Yeah, I guess so.

1191
00:56:28,828 --> 00:56:30,328
Let's start!

1192
00:56:31,828 --> 00:56:33,328
Left foot on yellow...

1193
00:56:33,328 --> 00:56:34,828
...baby pose!

1194
00:56:34,828 --> 00:56:36,328
Left foot... put it on yellow.

1195
00:56:36,328 --> 00:56:37,828
Yellow, got it.

1196
00:56:37,828 --> 00:56:40,328
And now you're gonna show us baby Shiori.

1197
00:56:40,328 --> 00:56:43,828
Waaah!

1198
00:56:46,328 --> 00:56:47,328
Okay, now...

1199
00:56:47,328 --> 00:56:48,328
Again!

1200
00:56:48,328 --> 00:56:50,328
Left foot on yellow...

1201
00:56:50,328 --> 00:56:51,828
...horse pose!

1202
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:53,328
Horse pose?

1203
00:56:53,328 --> 00:56:54,328

1204
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,328

Got it.

00:57:04,828 --> 00:57:06,328
...coolest prince pose.

1210
00:57:07,328 --> 00:57:09,828
Will you marry me then? There.

1211
00:57:09,828 --> 00:57:11,828
Kyaa!

1212
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,828
Okay... uh let's stop this. Right foot...

1213
00:57:14,828 --> 00:57:16,328
...on yellow...

1214
00:57:16,328 --> 00:57:17,328
Okay.

1215
00:57:18,328 --> 00:57:20,328
...and... witch pose!

1216
00:57:21,328 --> 00:57:23,828
This is my broom somewhere here.

1217
00:57:23,828 --> 00:57:24,828
Okay there's a broom here.

1218
00:57:27,328 --> 00:57:28,828
Okay... now your...

1219
00:57:28,828 --> 00:57:30,328

...on red.

1221
00:57:31,828 --> 00:57:32,828
Okay.

1222
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:34,828
And do a bear pose.

1223
00:57:34,828 --> 00:57:36,328
I am already in bear pose.

1224
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:37,828
Grrr!

1225
00:57:39,328 --> 00:57:41,828
Okay, you're gonna take your right hand...

1226
00:57:41,828 --> 00:57:43,328
...and put it onto yellow.

1227
00:57:43,328 --> 00:57:44,328
Okay.

1228
00:57:44,328 --> 00:57:46,328
And you're gonna do a butterfly pose.

1229
00:57:46,328 --> 00:57:48,328
I am wiggling like butterfly.

1230
00:57:48,328 --> 00:57:49,828
I am flying!

1231
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:52,328
Good job!

1232
00:57:54,328 --> 00:57:56,328
Good job Shiori!

1233
00:57:56,328 --> 00:57:58,328
Wow you did so good Shiori!

1234
00:57:58,328 --> 00:58:00,328
Wow you guys are all too good at this.

1235
00:58:01,828 --> 00:58:03,328
I don't know...

1236
00:58:03,328 --> 00:58:04,828
...you'll do great.

1237
00:58:05,328 --> 00:58:07,328
Well, Fuwawa, I think you're up.

1238
00:58:07,828 --> 00:58:08,828
Okay...

1239
00:58:08,828 --> 00:58:11,328
I don't know if I'm gonna be as good as everybody else.

1240
00:58:11,328 --> 00:58:12,828
You got this.

1241
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:16,328
Okay Fuwawa go on.

1242
00:58:16,828 --> 00:58:18,328

Okay, let's start!

00:58:29,328 --> 00:58:30,328
Yeah right.

1249
00:58:32,328 --> 00:58:33,328
Hula~

1250
00:58:33,328 --> 00:58:35,328
Whoa~

1251
00:58:36,328 --> 00:58:37,328
Okay okay.

1252
00:58:37,828 --> 00:58:39,328
Left foot on yellow...

1253
00:58:39,328 --> 00:58:40,828
...dolphin pose!

1254
00:58:41,328 --> 00:58:42,828
Oh no do they need water?

1255
00:58:42,828 --> 00:58:43,828
There's no water!

1256
00:58:43,828 --> 00:58:45,328
Dolphin sounds!

1257
00:58:46,328 --> 00:58:47,828
Okay next...

1258
00:58:48,328 --> 00:58:50,828

00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:53,828
Right hand on red...

1260
00:58:53,828 --> 00:58:54,828
Good luck.

1261
00:58:54,828 --> 00:58:56,328
Good luck with that.

1262
00:58:57,328 --> 00:58:58,328
Oh no...

1263
00:58:58,328 --> 00:59:00,328
You can do it! You can do it!

1264
00:59:01,328 --> 00:59:03,328
Fight! Fight!

1265
00:59:03,328 --> 00:59:04,828
You can do it!

1266
00:59:07,328 --> 00:59:08,828
You got it!

1267
00:59:08,828 --> 00:59:11,328
I can't put my foot all... ah, your foot! Your foot!

1268
00:59:15,328 --> 00:59:16,828
Okay okay next.

Right foot on yellow, puppy pose!

1270
00:59:19,328 --> 00:59:20,328
That's her default.

1271
00:59:20,328 --> 00:59:22,328
You can't take your hands off!

1272
00:59:22,328 --> 00:59:23,828
Where do you lean?

1273
00:59:23,828 --> 00:59:24,828
Huh?

1274
00:59:24,828 --> 00:59:26,328
Right foot... right foot...

すぐにクラクラ
...makes me dizzy instantly.

1537

まだまだ機能 願望BOX
Still more functions, desire BOX.

1555

Dyeing too, censored, absolutely.

1556
01:18:38,106 --> 01:18:40,106
あるわけないじゃない
There's no way that exists.

1557
01:18:40,106 --> 01:18:41,606
Can not believe

1558
01:18:41,606 --> 01:18:42,906
愛なんてただの勘違い
Love is just a misunderstanding.

1559

Don't like でも今のまま
Don't like, but as it is now...

1560
01:18:44,106 --> 01:18:45,306
大人ぶっている
...pretending to be an adult.

1561
01:18:45,306 --> 01:18:46,106
この感じ
This feeling.

1562
01:18:46,106 --> 01:18:48,606
だってもう 溶け出すような
Because already, like melting...

1563
01:18:48,606 --> 01:18:51,106
体温に身 任せれば
...if I surrender my body to the heat.

1564
01:18:51,106 --> 01:18:53,606
Don't care 私じゃないみたい
Don't care, it's like it's not me.

1565
01:18:53,606 --> 01:18:55,106
Ah No text me

1566
01:18:55,106 --> 01:18:56,306

I want 埋もれてたいな
I want, I want to be buried in it.

1569
01:19:00,106 --> 01:19:03,606
でも私がNOは絶対
But my 'NO' is absolute.

1570
01:19:03,606 --> 01:19:06,106
Let's taste it

1571
01:19:15,606 --> 01:19:17,606
ねぇ どうして
Hey, why?

1572
01:19:19,606 --> 01:19:25,106
愛は悪戯するんだろう
I wonder why love plays tricks.

1573
01:19:25,606 --> 01:19:30,106
ねぇ いつかは
Hey, someday...

1574
01:19:30,106 --> 01:19:35,606
叶えたいのも消えるの
...will even the wish to come true disappear?

1575
01:19:46,106 --> 01:19:49,106
後悔は案外簡単に
Regret comes unexpectedly easily...

1576
01:19:49,106 --> 01:19:51,606
否定して壊れちゃうけど
...denying and breaking it, but...

1577
01:19:51,606 --> 01:19:55,106
いつかだけの心は
...a heart for 'someday'...

1578
01:19:57,106 --> 01:19:59,606
気が付くの手を伸ばしちゃって
...realizing it, reaching out a hand.

1579
01:19:59,606 --> 01:20:00,906
その先欲しい
I want what's beyond.

1580
01:20:04,954 --> 01:20:05,654
Tada...
Just...

落ち着きましょう
Let's calm down.

1584
01:20:12,554 --> 01:20:15,154
その手で触れてよ
Touch me with those hands.

1585
01:20:15,754 --> 01:20:17,654
ほら 泣いて
Look, crying.

1586
01:20:18,054 --> 01:20:22,054
グラグラって酔っちゃいそうな Mind
A mind that feels like it's wobbling and getting drunk.

1587
01:20:22,054 --> 01:20:23,354
愛刺さる罠
A trap where love pierces.

1588
01:20:23,454 --> 01:20:27,354
モガモガって寄っちゃったのは Ah
Struggling and drawing closer, ah...

1589
01:20:27,454 --> 01:20:28,754
このせいで
Because of this.

01:20:28,754 --> 01:20:29,554
Help me

1591
01:20:29,554 --> 01:20:30,554
Rescue me

1592
01:20:30,554 --> 01:20:31,554
Save me

1593
01:20:31,754 --> 01:20:33,054
Mayday

1594
01:20:33,054 --> 01:20:36,054
どうしても溶け出す様な体温に
By the body heat that seems to melt no matter what,

1595
01:20:36,054 --> 01:20:39,754
身も分別きこそ外れ出したんだ
Even my body and reason have started to come undone.

1596
01:20:39,754 --> 01:20:41,554
もう Ask me して

What are you gonna use it for, sis?

1733
01:26:37,569 --> 01:26:39,069
Uh, I don't know.

1734
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:41,069
I think I'm gonna put it in matcha lattes too, but...

1735
01:26:41,069 --> 01:26:43,069
I think I could just put it in my wa- I could put it in anything.

1736
01:26:43,069 --> 01:26:45,369
You could just take 'em, you could chuck 'em too.

1737
01:26:45,569 --> 01:26:46,569
What?!

1738
01:26:46,569 --> 01:26:48,569
Not at people! But like, at the floor.

1739
01:26:48,569 --> 01:26:50,569
At people would be okay too.

1740
01:26:50,569 --> 01:26:52,069

01:27:51,069 --> 01:27:53,069
Along with these four items.

1768
01:27:53,069 --> 01:27:56,069
Only the Limited Edition comes with an autographed postcard.

1769
01:27:56,069 --> 01:27:57,069
So don't wait!

1770
01:27:57,069 --> 01:28:00,569
Get yours now for your fat flock friends!

1771
01:28:00,569 --> 01:28:02,569
Yeah!

1772
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:06,069
Now, what's this Day-Out With Nerissa bonus voice pack like, huh?

1773
01:28:06,069 --> 01:28:07,069
Do you have a preview?

1774
01:28:07,569 --> 01:28:10,069
I guess I could tell you a little bit about it.

1775
01:28:10,069 --> 01:28:11,569
Ooh!

1776
01:28:11,569 --> 01:28:14,069
Well, it's actually based off of the illustration.

1777
01:28:14,069 --> 01:28:16,069
So, uh, it's a day out.

1778
01:28:16,069 --> 01:28:18,569
Similar to the dates that you guys came out with...

1779
01:28:18,569 --> 01:28:21,569
I'm going to be going on a date with the Jailbirds...

1780
01:28:21,569 --> 01:28:23,069
...to an amusement park!

1781
01:28:23,069 --> 01:28:27,069
So you can look forward to the shenanigans that ensue.

1782
01:28:27,069 --> 01:28:28,569
Oh, shenanigans.

1783
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:30,069
Always shenanigans.

1784
01:28:30,069 --> 01:28:31,069
Touch grass.

1785
01:28:31,569 --> 01:28:35,069
Anyways, I worked really hard to come up with all this merch...

1786
01:28:35,069 --> 01:28:36,569
...so that everybody could enjoy it.

1787
01:28:36,569 --> 01:28:39,369
So be sure to grab yours as soon as it goes live!

1788
01:28:39,369 --> 01:28:41,069
The link will be in the description!

1789
01:28:41,069 --> 01:28:43,069
Yay!

1790
01:28:43,569 --> 01:28:46,069
Well, this turned out to be such a wonderful birthday.

1791
01:28:46,069 --> 01:28:47,069
Yeah!

1792
01:28:47,069 --> 01:28:48,569
And Advent...

1793
01:28:48,569 --> 01:28:51,569
I'm so happy that we could celebrate all together as well.

1794
01:28:51,569 --> 01:28:53,569
It made it so special for me.

1795
01:28:53,569 --> 01:28:55,369
Yeah!

1796
01:28:55,569 --> 01:28:59,069
And we also had Justice as guests too, singing with me!

1797
01:28:59,069 --> 01:29:03,069
So, thank you Justice for coming and celebrating with me as well.

1798
01:29:03,069 --> 01:29:06,069
And, most of all, thank you Jailbirds!

1799
01:29:06,069 --> 01:29:08,069
Yay! Happy birthday!

1800
01:29:08,069 --> 01:29:09,569
Thank you everyone!

1801
01:29:09,569 --> 01:29:11,069
Have a good day!

1802
01:29:11,069 --> 01:29:16,069
Bye bye!
