REQUIEM FOR LOVE

3
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,100
Oh you, there is no one I adore more.

4
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,100
You, who must have risked life and limb to be here with me forevermore.

5
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,800
The last words I wrote before I was cast into this endless abyss...

6
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,400
...by the immortals seeking to protect this world and all of its inhabitants.

7
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,000
Wrapped in darkness, alone, void of all emotion...

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,800
...I once more feel a presence signaling my return.

9
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,400
Love's fervent zeal, a spark of light in this ocean.

10
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Now there is but little left for you to do before I am free and we can be together.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,200
And those who trapped me within these pages shall rue locking away this beauty forever.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Only your love can set me free.

13
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,200
Go, recite the verse before you quickly...

14
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,000
...lest before me you bend and take a knee.

15
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Love Me, Love Me, Love Me

Love Me, Love Me, Love Me
Lyrics, Music: Kikuo
English Translyrics: Nerissa Ravencroft

16
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:26,000
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
La, la-la, la-la, la-la-la-la-la!

17
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:33,200
Once in a far away, far away world was a collar that coiled like a snake.

18
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,500
I want someone please, I need someone please, so I listened close as it howled in ache.

19
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,300
Please don't be angry and please don't abandon me, don't leave me here on my own. Okay?

20
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,800
It wrapped itself tightly, daily and nightly, only with praise would it loosen its hold.

21
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,000
I placed in the top of my class, there's no one left for me to surpass.

22
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't I look cute in this dress?

23
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,500
I really really must confess, it's tightening 'round my neck!

24
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,800
Give me your love, all of your love.

25
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,800
Give me your love, all you can conjure up.

26
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,800
Give me your love, all of your love,

27
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,100
till you go mad with ecstasy.

28
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,500
All of the hurt, all of the ache,

29
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,200
help me escape,

30
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,000
take it oh take it away!

31
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,500
Is there no end to this pain?

32
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:50,000
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

33
00:05:04,828 --> 00:05:10,128
Grow as you may but the necklace will stay just as small as the day it was found.

34
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:16,128
It's so suffocating, the endless placating, no one is, no one is ever enough.

35
00:05:16,828 --> 00:05:22,128
Won't lose to anyone, always rank number one, aren't you a beautiful child?

36
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:29,428
Hey! I'm better than her, I'm better than him, oh, everyone come round and gawk at perfection.

37
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:35,128
Meeting you right after school, I'm finally confessing to you.

38
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:38,428
Ain't it too good to be true?

39
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:44,628
A girl like me in love with you, who's miserable, vulgar and crude.

40
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:49,128
Give me your love, all of your love, give me your love...

41
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:53,128
...you can have everything if I have you.

42
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:57,828
I can have you, shoulder my load, now yours to behold.

43
00:05:57,928 --> 00:06:00,628
Still not enough, you're not enough.

44
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:06,128
Never enough, still I won't lose in my old...

45
00:06:07,128 --> 00:06:10,128
Truly I'm so sorry.

46
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:14,128
Give me your love, all of your love, give me your love...

47
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:18,128
...all you can conjure up.

48
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:22,428
Give me your love, all of your love, till you go mad with ecstasy.

49
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:25,128
I know it hurts, only gets worse.

50
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:31,828
God how it hurts, soon you'll be craving the pain.

51
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:37,128
This is my happiness!

52
00:06:57,228 --> 00:07:03,128
Is this my happiness?

53
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:32,928
Did you enjoy my lovely song?

54
00:07:33,128 --> 00:07:34,828
I hope you did.

55
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:37,928
It was for you, after all.

56
00:07:38,828 --> 00:07:42,128
But... why are you not smiling?

57
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:45,428
Are you not happy to see me?

58
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:48,628
Well...

59
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:50,628
Say something. Answer me!

60
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:53,428
Who... who are you?

61
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:54,628
What?

62
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:57,228
You don't know who I am?

63
00:07:57,428 --> 00:08:02,928
But everyone knows. You are the one that released me, right?

64
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:05,128
I'm... I'm sorry.

65
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:09,428
You're sorry? For what? For releasing me?

66
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:11,828
No, no, no.

67
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:13,628
For upsetting you.

68
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:16,628
If I said something wrong, I apologize.

69
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:18,128
Apologize?

70
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:23,128
You who should be amongst my most dearest and beloved followers...

71
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:26,128
...who has freed me from that prison...

72
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:29,128
...who has shown me your love above all others.

73
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:33,828
You then act like you don't even know who I am?

74
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:37,128
Why would you toy with my emotions?

75
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:40,628
I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean.

76
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:42,128
You're not sure what I mean?

77
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:44,128
Are you mocking me now?

78
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:47,928
If you truly do not know who I am, then why is it that you set me free?

79
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:52,128
If not for my love, and if not by your love...

80
00:08:52,228 --> 00:08:54,928
...then for what?

81
00:08:55,128 --> 00:08:58,828
Tell me the truth, and the whole truth, now!

82
00:08:59,428 --> 00:09:02,828
No more lies or there will be consequences.

83
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:04,828
I... I'm not lying.

84
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:08,428
I swear to you, I have no idea how I released you.

85
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:14,128
I just came to a temple to collect rare spices and memories from the many books stowed away here.

86
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,828
By the gods, that's the whole truth.

87
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:20,928
Extract memories from books?

88
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,928
Are you telling me you're a witch?

89
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:27,828
How dare you step foot here!

90
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:33,628
Even knowing the long history between demons and witches, you still dare step foot here?

91
00:09:34,128 --> 00:09:37,128
I know how witches dare to try and bind my kind.

92
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:41,628
Would you be foolish enough to dare attempt that on me?

93
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:44,828
Yes, okay. Yes, I'm a witch.

94
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:48,428
But I've never... well, mostly never, tried anything like that.

95
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:49,828
I swear.

96
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:53,128
And this time I was not led on by my nature at all. No.

97
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:57,928
This time it was an angel that told me of this place.

98
00:09:58,128 --> 00:10:01,628
An angel came to me in my dreams.

99
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:07,175
An angel came to me in my dreams...

100
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:09,375
...and told me of an enchanted book
with centuries of memories stored away here.

101
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,275
Can you imagine the knowledge and stories
hidden in centuries of memories?

102
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:18,775
With a prize like that,
I had to come find the book, no matter the danger.

103
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:22,175
Little could I have known
the true nature of the book, though...

104
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:23,275
Enough!

105
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:25,275
I've heard enough.

106
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:29,775
I believe you are who you say you are, a witch.

107
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:33,275
But I don't fully believe your childish story.

108
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:37,975
No angel would ever lead a witch
to such a dangerous book.

109
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:42,975
And I can hardly believe it is just the book
and not myself you are after.

110
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:47,775
It- It's true! An angel came to me
in my dreams and told me to come here.

111
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:52,075
I was drawn to that book
with all its power and stories.

112
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:57,775
And, well, I guess you inside it.

113
00:10:57,775 --> 00:11:01,775
The powerful aura it gave off drew me right to it.

114
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:07,775
How was I to know that the allure was thanks to
a demon trapped within its pages? Who would've guessed?

115
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:15,775
Though, now that I recount my story,
it does seem it really was me who released you.

116
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:22,775
Speaking of coming and going, now that you are free,
I think it is time I take my leave of this place.

117
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:26,675
I'm glad I was able to help free you from...
from whence you came!

118
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:31,275
I didn't say you could leave!

119
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:35,775
You may leave when I say you can leave.

120
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:39,275
And stop your nervous fidgeting.

121
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:44,775
I'm no fool. You think I didn't see you reaching
for your book of magic?

122
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:53,275
You, a witch, should know better than anyone
that no amount of magic is powerful enough
to destroy a demon of my power.

123
00:11:53,275 --> 00:12:01,275
However, you can take some small solace
in the fact that if I had wanted you dead,
you'd already be so.

124
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:06,775
The only reason you're still alive is because
you helped free me.

125
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:15,275
Alas, I cannot allow a witch who so obviously
came with the intent to bind me to her will
leave here freely.

126
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:19,275
Your story did little to convince me
your aims were otherwise.

127
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:22,275
So, I will give you an ultimatum.

128
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:26,775
You serve me here in my hollow temple.

129
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:28,775
Love me.

130
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,275
Adore me.

131
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:32,275
Worship me.

132
00:12:32,275 --> 00:12:36,775
Every living day, give me all the love you have.

133
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:39,775
Or I can take your soul right now.

134
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:41,775
Your choice.

135
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:46,775
Kiara... I need you.

136
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:09,775
Be My Guest
Lyrics, Music: Azari

137
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:06,975
Lost in the rain with no umbrella
Night snaps out your eyes

138
00:13:06,975 --> 00:13:10,575
Can't seem to find your way back home
Come in and be my guest

139
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:14,275
Lost in the rain with no umbrella
Night snaps out your eyes

140
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:17,975
Can't seem to find your way back home
Come in and be my guest

141
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:25,275
Such a lovely smile spread across your face
But it's simple forgery

142
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:32,575
If you need to hide from the world outside
Why not try to be my guest

143
00:13:32,575 --> 00:13:36,275
Waiting all day long but your friends don't come
And you're left there all alone

144
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:40,275
Still you can't jump off from the high rooftops
So come on and be my guest

145
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:43,575
Waiting all day long but your friends don't come
And you're left there all alone

146
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:47,275
Still you can't jump off from the high rooftops
So come on and be my guest

147
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:50,975
And like a cat the way I step and step and step

148
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,575
With carefully my feet go tap and tap and tap

149
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:57,975
You'll follow nicely with the snap and snap and snap

150
00:13:57,975 --> 00:14:01,575
So lovely you'll be mesmerized by me

151
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:05,575
My institutions peaceful as can be
Despite the way that it seems

152
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:09,575
Both our quotes and our supports
Will be concise, clear and clean

153
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:13,275
Since we're only starting out
There's some probabilities

154
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:17,275
But just listen up tonight
You'll have to stay up at least

155
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:24,275
No they don't like you when you know it's true
Still you're at their beck and call

156
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:31,275
Since you're desperately giving easily
Come inside and be my guest

157
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:38,575
You're the last to choose but you're left confused
Seems that someone took your share

158
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:45,975
If you won't accuse 'cause you don't have proof
Take a chance and be my guest

159
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:57,275
On the way back home there's a sweet aroma
That tempts you off your path

160
00:14:57,275 --> 00:15:01,275
I can't help but laugh 'cause I know in fact

161
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:03,825
...bound to be my guest

162
00:15:30,435 --> 00:15:31,075
Yo!

163
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:32,175
Demon!

164
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:34,975
How dare you kill an innocent?

165
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:39,475
Excuse me?

166
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:42,175
I've done no such thing.

167
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:43,275
Innocent?

168
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,925
I would hardly call a witch who lives for power

169
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:50,175
and binds my kind for her own purposes innocent.

170
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:51,675
Innocent?

171
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:54,475
The very idea is laughable.

172
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:56,575
Leave.

173
00:15:57,075 --> 00:15:59,175
I have no quarrel with you, so go now in peace

174
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:01,575
before I change my mind.

175
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:07,175
A small token for your past bravery and trials.

176
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:08,675
How gracious.

177
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:12,275
Don't think I can't see straight through your ploys though.

178
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:15,375
You will not escape justice.

179
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,975
Not this time.

180
00:16:17,575 --> 00:16:21,175
You have brought this fight on yourself through your actions, demon.

181
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:24,975
You have brought all of this on yourself.

182
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:26,175
For what?

183
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:28,275
For killing a mere witch?

184
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:30,175
She was not just a witch!

185
00:16:30,675 --> 00:16:32,075
She was my friend!

186
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:34,175
And a kind-hearted person.

187
00:16:35,575 --> 00:16:37,175
And you killed her

188
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:39,475
in cold blood.

189
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:42,975
Oh, the legendary Phoenix,

190
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:45,975
the mighty fiery Kiara,

191
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:48,175
friends with a witch?

192
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,675
It's almost funny.

193
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,975
Did you not realize?

194
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:56,575
It was your witch friend who freed me.

195
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:57,975
Liar!

196
00:16:58,575 --> 00:17:00,975
She would never do such a ghastly thing.

197
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,975
I trust she would stay away from the dark magics and demonic rituals.

198
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:10,175
To suggest otherwise is just another one of your dark lies.

199
00:17:11,975 --> 00:17:13,575
She didn't deserve to die.

200
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:15,275
Ah, poor Phoenix.

201
00:17:16,075 --> 00:17:19,075
Still so trusting of those around you

202
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:22,175
and unable to see through their deceptions.

203
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,275
Your kind spirit constantly deceives you.

204
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:28,975
That witch was never your friend.

205
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:32,075
We all know they cannot be trusted.

206
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,975
Even after all these years, you still have not changed.

207
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:41,175
Still believing in lies and still so easily misled.

208
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:44,175
Still such a fool.

209
00:17:45,075 --> 00:17:47,075
It is you who is the fool,

210
00:17:47,475 --> 00:17:48,275
demon!

211
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:54,075
Your lust for love and attention continues to lead you down the path of death and destruction.

212
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:58,975
And you don't even see that you're the one destroying your own happiness.

213
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:03,575
The Gods were right to confine you there.

214
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:08,075
You, who are still shackled by your lust for love,

215
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,275
your desire for attention,

216
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:12,875
your desire to be worshipped!

217
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:16,175
I am the Demon of Sound!

218
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:20,175
How dare you speak to me in such a manner.

219
00:18:21,175 --> 00:18:24,175
It is but right that all should worship me on their knees.

220
00:18:25,175 --> 00:18:28,175
Their love for none but myself.

221
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:29,975
Leave!

222
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:32,175
I have heard enough of your falsities.

223
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:34,175
This is your last warning.

224
00:18:35,475 --> 00:18:39,075
Go now, or you'll be left to rot here forever!

225
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:41,575
I am not afraid of you,

226
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:44,175
and I will heed no such warning.

227
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:48,275
Listen, and listen well, demon.

228
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:52,075
I will not allow you to claim any more victims.

229
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:56,975
To be banished in a void was not sufficient enough punishment for you.

230
00:18:59,475 --> 00:18:59,975
No.

231
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:04,175
Now, I will finish what the Gods should have.

232
00:19:12,575 --> 00:19:16,075
Come on get moving cause now I'm on a roll oh

You gotta throw your hands up

252

You can't decide

253
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:08,865

As we can light it up up up enough

259
00:20:19,815 --> 00:20:21,265
I'm standing round

260
00:20:21,265 --> 00:20:23,315
Can't avoid the voices in my head

And now it's time to learn your place

00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:44,265
Smoking like a cigar cigar

IRyS.

289
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:46,665
It has been so long.

290
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:47,665
IRyS.

291
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:50,365
Nerissa, I'm so so sorry this happened to you.

292
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:52,765
It was not my intention.

293
00:21:53,965 --> 00:21:55,215
What do you mean?

294
00:21:55,265 --> 00:21:57,215
What was not your intention?

295
00:21:57,815 --> 00:21:58,565
This.

296
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:01,015
You being... then the witch...

297
00:22:01,065 --> 00:22:02,165
...and Kiara too.

298
00:22:03,715 --> 00:22:04,465
What?

299
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:07,815
Are you saying you sent the Phoenix here to slay me?

300
00:22:08,765 --> 00:22:10,365
No, I didn't!

301
00:22:10,515 --> 00:22:11,215
Well, yes...

302
00:22:11,215 --> 00:22:12,565
...but it was not my intention.

303
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,465
IRyS, what are you trying to tell me?

304
00:22:15,915 --> 00:22:17,365
That you tried to kill me?

305
00:22:17,515 --> 00:22:19,765
You who were supposed to be my friend!

306
00:22:19,865 --> 00:22:22,615
We've been friends since the beginning!

307
00:22:22,865 --> 00:22:24,365
Yes, of course, yes!

308
00:22:24,765 --> 00:22:26,865
You sent Kiara to kill me?

309
00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:27,765
No, no!

310
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:28,815
Then what?

311
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:29,965
Be clear!

312
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:32,665
Or is this how you greet your beloved friend...

313
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:34,965
...after so long?

314
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:36,515
No, I...

315
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,265
I would never send someone to kill you.

316
00:22:39,465 --> 00:22:41,265
But yes, I'm still your loyal friend.

317
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:44,565
I always have been and always will be.

318
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:47,665
I... I tried to free you...

319
00:22:47,715 --> 00:22:48,715
...and I did.

320
00:22:48,865 --> 00:22:51,465
I sent the witch Shiori here to free you...

321
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:52,565
...and she did.

322
00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:55,565
But I didn't know she was friends with Kiara...

323
00:22:55,565 --> 00:22:58,015
...and would summon her here if threatened.

324
00:22:58,215 --> 00:22:59,715
I thought she would come alone.

325
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:01,215
This was not supposed to happen.

326
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:02,515
It was not my intention.

327
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,315
You sent a witch to free me?

328
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:08,865
Why would you send one who binds my kind for power?

329
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:11,315
Of all those in the world...

330
00:23:11,465 --> 00:23:12,465
...a witch?

331
00:23:12,765 --> 00:23:15,315
Why not send one of my most beloved followers?

332
00:23:15,565 --> 00:23:18,365
Only they are said to be able to free me.

333
00:23:23,165 --> 00:23:24,515
Explain yourself!

334
00:23:24,715 --> 00:23:26,015
What's going on?

335
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:28,065
I'm...

336
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:28,815
I'm sorry.

337
00:23:28,915 --> 00:23:31,265
I have a lot to explain,

338
00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:32,765
but we don't have time now.

339
00:23:32,915 --> 00:23:34,065
We need to go.

340
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:34,965
Now!

341
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:36,515
Death is coming for you.

342
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:37,265
What?

343
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:38,665
Please...

344
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:39,765
...come with me.

345
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:42,865
I know a way in which we can hide from death,

346
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:45,165
but we have to leave now, before it's too late.

347
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,715
I'm not going anywhere with you

348
00:23:48,765 --> 00:23:51,715
until you explain to me what is going on.

349
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:52,615
Now!

350
00:23:52,715 --> 00:23:55,315
Why would you send a witch to free me, IRyS?

351
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:57,815
Nerissa, I had no choice.

352
00:23:58,715 --> 00:23:59,965
You had no choice?

353
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,865
You could have sent one of my followers instead.

354
00:24:03,815 --> 00:24:05,515
You don't have any more followers.

355
00:24:05,615 --> 00:24:07,015
They're all dead.

356
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:08,915
They all died...

357
00:24:09,065 --> 00:24:10,315
...long ago.

358
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:11,315
What?

359
00:24:11,815 --> 00:24:13,615
No... that can't be.

360
00:24:14,715 --> 00:24:16,515
Has it been that long?

361
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,665
It's been over a thousand years

362
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:23,265
since you've been locked away.

363
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:24,765
And your followers...

364
00:24:24,815 --> 00:24:26,115
...they're all gone now.

365
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:28,515
It's been many long years

366
00:24:28,565 --> 00:24:30,765
since your name was whispered in these lands.

367
00:24:30,915 --> 00:24:32,265
You mean they...

368
00:24:32,315 --> 00:24:33,815
...no longer...

369
00:24:34,615 --> 00:24:36,165
...love me?

370
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:38,615
I...

371
00:24:38,665 --> 00:24:39,515
I'm sorry.

372
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:41,815
I tried to free you as fast as I could.

373
00:24:41,865 --> 00:24:42,865
I really did.

374
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:45,665
But it took a long time to work out how to free you,

375
00:24:45,715 --> 00:24:47,665
and there was so much going on.

376
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:50,415
And the gods weren't about to look kindly

377
00:24:50,465 --> 00:24:52,815
on any trying to undo their work either.

378
00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:54,565
I'm sorry.

379
00:24:54,665 --> 00:24:57,215
I don't have time to explain everything right now.

380
00:24:58,565 --> 00:24:59,715
I understand.

381
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,365
But IRyS...

382
00:25:03,863 --> 00:25:04,443
Tell me.

383
00:25:04,693 --> 00:25:06,893
Do you still love me?

384
00:25:07,393 --> 00:25:09,793
What? Yes, of course!

385
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:12,293
Then why do you lie to me?

386
00:25:12,593 --> 00:25:14,943
I... I'm not lying, Nerissa!

387
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:15,943
Enough!

388
00:25:16,593 --> 00:25:20,293
You of all people should understand that a witch

389
00:25:20,293 --> 00:25:24,193
wouldn't be able to resist the power in my book
and attempt to bind me.

390
00:25:24,593 --> 00:25:28,793
And you can hardly expect me to believe that you,

391
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:33,193
one of both planes, didn't know of the witch's
connection to such a famed warrior.

392
00:25:33,593 --> 00:25:36,493
This wasn't an attempt to free me.

393
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,293
This...

394
00:25:39,293 --> 00:25:41,693
This was an attempt to kill me.

395
00:25:41,893 --> 00:25:45,293
To be free of me, to do what the gods couldn't.

396
00:25:45,893 --> 00:25:46,593
Get back!

397
00:25:46,993 --> 00:25:50,093
Nerissa, that's not true. You don't understand.

398
00:25:50,293 --> 00:25:52,893
Please give me some time to explain.

399
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,093
But not here. Death is coming for you.

400
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:57,093
We have to go.

401
00:25:57,493 --> 00:25:59,593
I'm not going anywhere with you.

402
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:03,193
Nerissa! Surely by now Kiara's soul
has arrived before Death.

403
00:26:03,393 --> 00:26:06,593
And once Death finds out that you are free again...

404
00:26:06,793 --> 00:26:11,293
We don't have much time. We have to go. Now!

405
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:12,193
Please, Nerissa!

406
00:26:12,493 --> 00:26:15,193
No! I don't believe you.

407
00:26:15,393 --> 00:26:17,393
You've broken my spirit.

408
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:21,693
To learn that my followers no longer love me
was one thing.

409
00:26:22,093 --> 00:26:25,793
But to discover that my closest

410
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:29,293
and most loyal friend has betrayed me...

411
00:26:29,493 --> 00:26:34,293
...tried to kill me, and no longer loves me too.

412
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,093
If you no longer wish to give me your love,

413
00:26:38,293 --> 00:26:40,993
then I... will take it.

414
00:26:45,993 --> 00:26:49,993
Missing Promise

415
00:26:45,993 --> 00:26:49,993
Lyrics: hotaru  Music: 半田 翼
Lyrics: hotaru  Music: Tsubasa Handa

416
00:27:00,443 --> 00:27:02,743
遠ざかり始めた
Has begun to recede

417
00:27:02,793 --> 00:27:07,193
その背中はもう振り返らない
That back of yours already won't look back

418
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:12,943
長い夜が明けても
Even if the long night ends

419
00:27:13,043 --> 00:27:19,643
過ちと罪は今もずっと消えずに
Mistakes and sins still won't ever disappear

420
00:27:20,093 --> 00:27:22,893
落ちる夕陽 闇が忍び寄り
The setting sun, darkness creeping in

421
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:26,043
黒く染まってく現実
A reality turning black

422
00:27:26,193 --> 00:27:32,093
想うほどに どうして傷つけ試した
Why did I hurt and test you as much as I cared?

423
00:27:32,293 --> 00:27:35,193
欲しかったのは ただ光射す
What I wanted was just that sunlit

424
00:27:35,293 --> 00:27:38,093
その笑顔なのに
smile

425
00:27:38,243 --> 00:27:41,943
何度間違い続けた日々を
As if untying and retying

426
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:45,293
ほどいて結び直すように
the days I kept making mistakes

427
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:48,643
迷っても愛にいくよ
I'll go to love even if I'm lost

428
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:51,993
哀しい涙は拭って
Wiping away sad tears

429
00:27:52,143 --> 00:27:55,343
いつの間にか忘れていた
Searching for that gentle voice

430
00:27:55,493 --> 00:27:58,693
その優しい声を探して
I'd forgotten before I knew it

431
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,043
また手を取り合えたなら
If we could hold hands again

432
00:28:02,193 --> 00:28:06,793
君ともう一度約束を
I'd make a promise with you once more

433
00:28:11,493 --> 00:28:15,893
途切れそうな可能性
Chasing the possibility that's about to break

434
00:28:16,043 --> 00:28:20,443
見失わないように追いかけて
So I don't lose sight of it

435
00:28:20,593 --> 00:28:23,493
手に入れたものなら
If it's something I obtained

436
00:28:23,643 --> 00:28:30,243
理想とは違う どこか欠けた愛情
It's different from the ideal, a love lacking something

437
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:34,043
怒り 嘆き 歪めたまま
Anger, grief, distorted as they are

438
00:28:34,193 --> 00:28:37,393
ぶつけ合う逆さまの言葉
We hurl inverted words at each other

439
00:28:37,543 --> 00:28:43,243
想うほどに どうして許せなかった
Why couldn't I forgive you as much as I cared?

440
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:46,493
守りたかった 笑顔を
I wanted to protect your smile

441
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:49,343
気づけば壊して
But I realized I'd broken it

442
00:28:49,493 --> 00:28:52,793
たとえすれ違い離れてても
Even if we pass each other by and drift apart

443
00:28:52,943 --> 00:28:56,143
君を信じられたなら
If I could have believed in you

444
00:28:56,293 --> 00:28:59,493
また会える日が来たかな
I wonder if the day we meet again would've come

445
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:02,843
二人の懐かしい顔で
With our nostalgic faces

446
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:06,193
何気なく過ごしていた
If I look back on those times

447
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:09,543
あの時を思い返すなら
we spent casually

448
00:29:09,693 --> 00:29:12,893
ありのまま伝えあえてた
We could've told each other things as they were

449
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:18,293
まるで運命のように
Just like destiny

450
00:29:28,543 --> 00:29:31,743
無くしたものかも 戻らないこと
Even if I know that what I've lost

451
00:29:31,893 --> 00:29:35,093
分かっていても
might not come back

452
00:29:35,243 --> 00:29:41,543
願いをかけること 辞められはしない
I won't ever stop making a wish

453
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:44,893
いつか どれほど大切な
Every time my chest aches

454
00:29:45,043 --> 00:29:50,143
人だったのか 胸が苦しむ度に
I'll know how important a person you were one day

455
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:54,293
知った
I'll know

456
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:59,793
共に過ごした日を
The days we spent together

457
00:30:01,818 --> 00:30:04,718
笑い合った日々を
The days we laughed together

458
00:30:10,818 --> 00:30:14,418
何度間違い続けた日々を
The days we kept making mistakes

459
00:30:14,418 --> 00:30:18,218
解いて結び直すように
As if to untie and retie them

460
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:21,318
迷っても会いに行くよ
Even if I lose my way, I'll go to meet you

461
00:30:21,318 --> 00:30:24,718
悲しい涙は拭って
Wipe away the sad tears

462
00:30:24,718 --> 00:30:27,718
いつの間にか忘れていた
I had forgotten before I knew it

463
00:30:27,718 --> 00:30:30,918
その優しい声を探して
Looking for that gentle voice

464
00:30:30,918 --> 00:30:34,918
ただ手を取り合えたなら
If only we could just hold hands

465
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:39,418
君ともう一度約束を交わそう
Let's make a promise with you once more

466
00:31:18,718 --> 00:31:20,018
Kiara.

467
00:31:20,018 --> 00:31:21,218
Dead.

468
00:31:21,818 --> 00:31:24,718
Huh, never thought I'd see the day.

469
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:27,218
But tell me, what laid you low?

470
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,718
I must know, as there are few that could bring this about.

471
00:31:30,718 --> 00:31:35,718
And even fewer who would give you reason to voyage on through my blackened halls

472
00:31:35,718 --> 00:31:39,418
and not return to the world of the living as a hatchling.

473
00:31:39,418 --> 00:31:41,718
Must be urgent, whatever it is.

474
00:31:40,618 --> 00:31:42,218
Forgive me, but...

475
00:31:42,218 --> 00:31:45,418
...I felt this was something you needed to hear urgently.

476
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:49,718
I was slain by one with whom you are quite familiar.

477
00:31:49,718 --> 00:31:52,218
A tyrant of darkness.

478
00:31:52,218 --> 00:31:55,718
One out to bring all the world under her domain.

479
00:31:55,718 --> 00:31:59,418
To worship her for all eternity.

480
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:01,218
It can't be.

481
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:06,718
I'm afraid the Demon of Sound has been freed from the void again

482
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:09,718
and is in the world once more.

483
00:32:10,218 --> 00:32:14,718
Her long confinement has ended, and she is the same as she has ever been.

484
00:32:14,718 --> 00:32:19,718
Quick to anger, blinded by her lust for adoration.

485
00:32:20,718 --> 00:32:25,218
And this time, I was the second victim of her lust for love and blood.

486
00:32:25,218 --> 00:32:29,218
You? Murdered by that love-obsessed demon?

487
00:32:29,718 --> 00:32:30,718
Yes.

488
00:32:31,718 --> 00:32:35,218
And her first victim was a good friend of mine, too.

489
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:40,218
Forgive me, Lord Death, but this injustice cannot stand.

490
00:32:40,718 --> 00:32:45,218
Unfortunately, her power is already beyond my ability to stop.

491
00:32:45,218 --> 00:32:48,718
Please, you must do something to stop that demon.

492
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:51,218
That monster.

493
00:32:52,218 --> 00:32:54,218
She will surely only take more lives...

494
00:32:54,218 --> 00:32:57,718
...and plunge the world into further chaos.

495
00:32:58,218 --> 00:32:59,718
Come on, quick!

496
00:32:59,718 --> 00:33:04,218
Ascend to the world of the living with your great scythe in hand...

497
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:08,718
...and reap the life of the Demon of Sound before she can claim another victim.

498
00:33:09,218 --> 00:33:13,718
Avenge my life and the life of my friend, I beg you.

499
00:33:14,218 --> 00:33:17,718
That demon cannot be left to ravage the world once more.

500
00:33:17,718 --> 00:33:20,218
I warned the other gods before, but here we are.

501
00:33:20,218 --> 00:33:25,718
It is time I take this into my own hand and do what I should have done long ago.

502
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:42,718
Hmph. Your demonic side was always to be the death of you, IRyS.

503
00:33:42,718 --> 00:33:45,218
Don't you dare speak her name!

504
00:33:45,218 --> 00:33:46,218
Silence!

505
00:33:46,218 --> 00:33:50,218
Your bloodlust and desire for adoration has clouded your judgment...

506
00:33:50,218 --> 00:33:53,218
...to the point where you can't even tell friend from foe anymore.

507
00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:57,218
You're the one who brought bloody doom upon your own beloved friend.

508
00:33:57,218 --> 00:33:59,218
And yourself.

509
00:33:59,718 --> 00:34:04,718
Your fear of losing your hold over things brings about the very result you so fear.

510
00:34:05,218 --> 00:34:06,718
How dare you!

511
00:34:06,718 --> 00:34:11,718
Continue on with your excuses, blame who you will for your own misdoing if you wish.

512
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:16,718
In the end, you have only yourself to blame for the situation you find yourself in.

513
00:34:17,218 --> 00:34:22,218
A lust for love so strong that those you loved turn away.

514
00:34:23,218 --> 00:34:26,218
A desire for power so overwhelming...

515
00:34:26,218 --> 00:34:30,718
...those you have power over turn on you.

516
00:34:31,218 --> 00:34:36,718
An anger so deep that you destroy all who might have helped save you.

517
00:34:37,218 --> 00:34:40,718
Your fate has been sealed by your own hand.

518
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:45,718
And now, I am now here to deliver it to you.

519
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,718
Why do you get to decide who lives or dies?

520
00:34:50,718 --> 00:34:53,718
You, who sits alone in your own realm.

521
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:59,418
Empress of all, both life and death at your fingertips.

522
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:01,218
Why?

523
00:35:01,505 --> 00:35:07,205
What could you possibly know about the desire for the love and adoration of others?

524
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:11,505
You, who already has everything.

525
00:35:12,505 --> 00:35:20,205
You, and all the gods, all full of yourselves and so ready to look down upon those of us who fight for more.

526
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:27,305
Mouths full of twisted tongues...

527
00:35:28,305 --> 00:35:32,805
Their hearts rot with jealousy.

528
00:35:34,205 --> 00:35:39,005
They're jealous of me!

529
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:44,705
Spiteful that I was loved more!

530
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:53,805
Again, you cannot see past your own desires.

531
00:35:54,105 --> 00:35:57,305
The gods took pity on you and your kind.

532
00:35:57,605 --> 00:36:01,105
When I created you, the first demon,

533
00:36:01,405 --> 00:36:06,305
the gods felt it unjust and dangerous for such a being to exist for the sole purpose

534
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:11,305
of watching over the surface in my stead. To be mindless, soulless.

535
00:36:11,605 --> 00:36:15,105
So, they gave the demon a psyche

536
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:18,305
and plucked it from my deepest and blackest halls,

537
00:36:18,405 --> 00:36:21,805
freeing it to roam amongst the two worlds whenever it pleased.

538
00:36:23,605 --> 00:36:28,505
I warned them that the demonic nature was too strong and dangerous to give such desires,

539
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:34,005
and far too dangerous for such a being to exist alongside the mortals.

540
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:37,505
But, the others persisted and now here we are.

541
00:36:37,805 --> 00:36:43,305
My unheeded warnings leading us back to where it all started.

542
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:49,605
You almost plunged the world into chaos due to your unbridled lust for adoration.

543
00:36:49,705 --> 00:36:53,005
Time and time again you gave in to your nature.

544
00:36:53,105 --> 00:36:59,805
Banishing you to a void was supposed to be a chance for you to reflect on your past,

545
00:37:00,005 --> 00:37:04,305
but it has only proven that you are truly unfit for this world.

546
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:17,205
アイアイヘイチューなななななんですの
I-I-I-I hate you, what is it?

547
00:37:17,305 --> 00:37:20,205
君がいなきゃあたしは無い無い
Without you, I am nothing

はいはいそうですねその通りです
Yes, yes, that's right, exactly

550
00:37:23,305 --> 00:37:26,305
喉を過ぎ去れば解の在り処
Once it passes through the throat, the location of the solution

551
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:39,705
アイアイヘイチューなななななんですの
I-I-I-I hate you, what is it?

552
00:37:39,805 --> 00:37:42,805
君は軽薄くたびれだけ
You are frivolous and only weary

553
00:37:42,905 --> 00:37:46,805
あたし一人じゃいられない
I can't be alone

554
00:37:46,905 --> 00:37:48,205
それは常にひしひし
That's always piercing

555
00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:51,205
あなたワイワイどうして？　でんでんダメですの
You're noisy, why? Not good at all

556
00:37:51,305 --> 00:37:54,405
意味があるなら言葉にせずに
If there's a meaning, don't put it into words

557
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:57,805
正しさ態度で示さなきゃ
You must show the correctness in your attitude

558
00:37:57,905 --> 00:38:01,005
すべてがずっと笑われないまま丸まる
Everything keeps being laughed at as it curls up

559
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:03,905
トップシークレット明かさないように
Top secret, don't reveal it

560
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:07,205

00:38:10,305 --> 00:38:13,205

565
00:38:39,305 --> 00:38:42,305
やはり軽薄ご機嫌なあたし
As expected, frivolous, me in high spirits

566
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:45,305
渇いた底冷えいずるの
The dry, bone-chilling cold emerges

567
00:38:45,405 --> 00:38:48,505
君がいまがいま踊る高嶺など
The peak where you're dancing now

568
00:38:48,605 --> 00:38:51,205
トップシークレット愛に似た焦燥
Top secret, impatience similar to love

569
00:38:51,305 --> 00:38:54,805
喉を火傷させる
Burning the throat

576

はいはいそうですねその通りです

584
00:40:02,286 --> 00:40:03,786
奈落の底で
In the depths of hell

585
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,486
ストップ！
Stop!

586
00:40:36,421 --> 00:40:38,816
Oh, such a misguided fool.

587
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:44,586
Your reckless ways have brought black doom upon yourself and those most beloved around you.

588
00:40:44,586 --> 00:40:50,516
Blaming your misery on others when your demise was, in fact, forged by your own hands.

589
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:53,006
While you have earned your death in full,

590
00:40:53,006 --> 00:40:56,786
it is with pity, not anger,

591
00:40:56,786 --> 00:41:01,806
that this blade falls upon you.

592
00:41:29,486 --> 00:41:32,486
炉心融解

00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:59,361
街明かり 華やか エーテル麻酔の冷たさ
The bustling city and its neon lights, a touch of ether that's cold as ice

594
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:04,861
眠れない 午前二時 全てが急速に変わる
It's 2 AM and I can hardly sleep cause everything keeps changing rapidly

595
00:42:04,861 --> 00:42:07,861
オイル切れのライター
I'm like a lighter that's all out of gas

596
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:09,986
焼けつくような胃の中
My insides are on fire

597
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:12,611
全てがそう嘘なら
If only everything was a lie

598
00:42:12,611 --> 00:42:16,611
本当に良かったのにね
Things would be so much better

599
00:42:16,611 --> 00:42:19,986
君の首を絞める夢を見た
I had a dream where these hands of mine were strangling your neck

600
00:42:19,986 --> 00:42:22,361
光の溢れる昼下がり
On a bright, sunny afternoon

601
00:42:22,361 --> 00:42:25,486
君の細い喉が跳ねるのを
I watched your slender throat twitch

602
00:42:25,486 --> 00:42:29,611
泣き出しそうな目で見つめていた
As my eyes welled up with tears

603
00:42:29,611 --> 00:42:38,486
核融合炉にさ 飛び込んでみたいと思う
I want to throw myself into a nuclear reactor

604
00:42:38,486 --> 00:42:42,361
真っ青な光 包まれて綺麗
And its pale blue light would envelop me so beautifully

605
00:42:42,361 --> 00:42:48,361
核融合炉にさ 飛び込んでみたら そしたら
If I could throw myself into a nuclear reactor

606
00:42:48,361 --> 00:42:53,861
すべてが許されるような気がして
Then everything might be okay, I might be forgiven

607
00:43:05,611 --> 00:43:11,361
ベランダの向こう側 階段を昇ってゆく音
On the other side of the veranda, I hear footsteps ascending the stairs

608
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:17,111
陰り出した空が 窓ガラスに部屋に落ちる
As the clouds creep over the sunlight, it drips through my window and into my room

609
00:43:17,111 --> 00:43:22,861
拡散する夕暮れ 泣き腫らしたような日の赤
Twilight scatters across the horizon, red like eyes swollen by tears

610
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:25,486
融けるように少しずつ
Slowly but surely, it's melting away

611
00:43:25,486 --> 00:43:28,611
少しずつ死んでゆく世界
Slowly but steadily, the world is dying

612
00:43:28,611 --> 00:43:30,986
君の首を絞める夢を見た
I had a dream where these hands of mine were strangling your neck

613
00:43:30,986 --> 00:43:34,361
春風に揺れるカーテン
My curtains were swaying gently in the spring breeze

614
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:37,986
乾いて切れた唇から
Your dry, parched lips mustered up

615
00:43:37,986 --> 00:43:42,111
こぼれる言葉は泡のよう
Words that would vanish like foam on the waves

616
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:50,486
核融合炉にさ 飛び込んでみたいと思う
I want to throw myself into a nuclear reactor

617
00:43:50,486 --> 00:43:54,861
真っ白に記憶 融かされて消える
Into the shining, white light my memories will fade and disappear

618
00:43:54,861 --> 00:44:01,486
核融合炉にさ 飛び込んでみたら また昔みたいに
If I could throw myself into a nuclear reactor, I might be able to sleep like I used to

619
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:06,611
眠れるようなそんな気がして
And everything might be okay, I feel like I'll be able to sleep again

620
00:44:28,861 --> 00:44:34,861
時計の秒針や テレビの司会者や
The second hand on the clock, and the host on the television

621
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:39,986
そこにいるけど 見えない誰かの
Someone who is there, but I just can't see...

622
00:44:39,986 --> 00:44:42,986
そこに見えない誰かの
There's someone there

623
00:44:42,986 --> 00:44:45,486
見えない誰かの
But I just can't see them

624
00:44:45,486 --> 00:44:52,611
笑い声 飽和して 反響する
Their laughter swells and grows into an endless echo

625
00:44:52,611 --> 00:44:52,861
Allegro agitate

626
00:44:52,861 --> 00:45:01,361
耳鳴りが消えない 止まない
The ringing in my ears won't stop, it won't go away

627
00:45:04,804 --> 00:45:08,179
Allegro agitate

628
00:45:09,129 --> 00:45:14,879
耳鳴りが消えない　止まない
The ringing in my ears won't stop, it won't go away

629
00:45:41,279 --> 00:45:44,179
誰も皆消えていく夢を見た
I had a dream where the whole entire world disappeared

630
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:46,979
真夜中の部屋の広さと静寂が
Tonight, I'm swallowed by the vastness of my dark room

631
00:45:46,979 --> 00:45:50,079
胸につかえて
Yet, silence closes in and suffocates me

632
00:45:50,529 --> 00:45:53,979
上手に息ができなくなる
My lungs can't find the air I need to breath

633
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:01,479
核融合炉にさ　飛び込んでみたいと思う
If I could throw myself into a nuclear reactor

634
00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:07,079
そしたらきっと眠るように　消えていけるんだ
Then I could finally fade away, as easily as closing my eyes to sleep

635
00:46:07,479 --> 00:46:14,879
僕のいない朝は　今よりずっと素晴らしくて
A new dawn without me would surely be dazzling new day

636
00:46:15,279 --> 00:46:21,079
全ての歯車が噛み合った
All of the gears would be turning together in harmony

637
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:29,679
きっとそんな世界だ
Surely, that's how the world would be

638
00:47:02,979 --> 00:47:05,879
Hi darlings, and welcome to my 3D concert.

639
00:47:05,879 --> 00:47:08,479
My first technically solo one!

640
00:47:08,479 --> 00:47:11,179
As you can see up here is the hashtag for today,

641
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:15,179
which is #RequiemforLove3D.

642
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:17,179
I'm watching the chat. Did you guys enjoy it?

643
00:47:17,179 --> 00:47:18,479
Did you like it? Did you have fun?

644
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:19,179
I sure hope so.

645
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:23,679
Well, obviously a lot just happened,

646
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:26,179
but I must let you all know

647
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:28,179
this was all a musical,

648
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,879
so none of it was real. I didn't—no one is hurt.

649
00:47:31,879 --> 00:47:34,179
There was no Hololive girls hurt

650
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:36,179
in the making of this musical,

651
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:38,179
so please don't worry.

652
00:47:38,179 --> 00:47:41,179
Um, this stage is awesome,

653
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:43,479
so I want to give it up to the team

654
00:47:43,479 --> 00:47:45,179
over at Hololive Productions

655
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:48,679
who put this all together.

656
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:51,179
Can we just take a look, take a moment to admire

657
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:53,179
this beautiful stage before us?

658
00:47:53,179 --> 00:47:55,479
Some of the more lesser-shown details

659
00:47:55,479 --> 00:47:57,179
I kind of wanted to highlight a little bit.

660
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:00,679
So, let's go ahead and take a look at,

661
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:04,479
maybe the moon, maybe. Look at that big thing

662
00:48:04,479 --> 00:48:07,479
in the background! It was also dark red

663
00:48:07,479 --> 00:48:10,179
at one point,

664
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:14,179
but currently it is as it probably should be—

665
00:48:14,179 --> 00:48:16,179
normal, beautiful, because I was killed. So...

666
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:19,179
We also have the giant castle in the background,

667
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:22,179
which is, oh my gosh, I was so excited for this!

668
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:24,179
I was like "I want something that's really

669
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:25,679
kind of like cathedral-esque"

670
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:29,179
and dark and gothic and they fully delivered!

671
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:33,179
I'm so, so pleased with how it ended up looking

672
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:35,179
in the final. So, so happy.

673
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:38,679
We also have the beautiful stained glass.

674
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:41,679
If you take a look back there,

675
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:44,679
these ones were actually screens,

676
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:48,179
but we also have the ones on the side

677
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:50,679
that were a little bit broken,

678
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:54,179
but could also change as well. So, very fun!

679
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:57,179
It was kind of something that I was like,

680
00:48:57,179 --> 00:49:00,179
"Oh, I wonder how it's gonna go?"

681
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:03,679
But I think it ended up looking really cool, right?

682
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:07,179
Lastly, we have all of these lovely flowers

683
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:10,179
out in front. I just thought they came out

684
00:49:10,179 --> 00:49:12,179
so pretty and I love how they kind of

685
00:49:12,179 --> 00:49:14,679
change throughout.

686
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:17,179
So it just kind of looked like nothingness,

687
00:49:17,179 --> 00:49:20,179
like a little void of like dead plants,

688
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:24,179
but then at the end they all bloomed

689
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:27,179
and it was so beautiful and oh my gosh!

690
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:30,179
I was so nervous! You might have noticed

691
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:34,179
also, something's a little different about me today.

692
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:37,179
Do you see anything different? My wings are out!

693
00:49:37,179 --> 00:49:40,179
I decided since we've known each other

694
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:43,179
for kind of a long time now,

695
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:46,179
that maybe it was finally time to...

696
00:49:46,179 --> 00:49:49,179
stop pretending they're a coat and actually

697
00:49:49,179 --> 00:49:52,179
show you what they were.

698
00:49:52,179 --> 00:49:54,679
But I did decide to take off my arm warmers

699
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:56,179
a little bit

700
00:49:56,179 --> 00:49:58,679
just cause, you know, I was feeling a little

701
00:49:58,679 --> 00:49:59,879
warm after all of that movement.

702
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:57,179
Yeah, there we go! What do you think?

703
00:49:57,179 --> 00:49:59,679
I am capable!

704
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:00,965
...of flight.

705
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:04,865
Obviously, it's a little—

706
00:50:06,165 --> 00:50:08,765
It's a little slow, but I'm working on it.

707
00:50:08,765 --> 00:50:10,865
I'm working on my muscles.

708
00:50:11,765 --> 00:50:13,565
So, we'll—I'll figure it out eventually.

709
00:50:13,565 --> 00:50:16,165
It's been a while. I was locked up for like

710
00:50:16,165 --> 00:50:18,365
9,000 years. Cut me some slack!

711
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:26,465
Well, this is all very exciting.

712
00:50:26,465 --> 00:50:29,265
So again, I'm so happy to have you here.

713
00:50:29,265 --> 00:50:33,765
I wanted to talk a little bit about—I have an announcement after this, but before that...

714
00:50:33,765 --> 00:50:36,765
...I wanted to talk a little bit about just the making of this.

715
00:50:36,765 --> 00:50:41,565
Whoa! We had so many lovely guests, first and foremost.

716
00:50:41,565 --> 00:50:44,065
First, we started off with Shiori Novella...

717
00:50:44,065 --> 00:50:49,165
...who was our beautiful, cute witch, who came here maybe not knowing what she was getting into.

718
00:50:49,465 --> 00:50:54,365
Then, we had Takanashi Kiara, the brave, amazing Phoenix...

719
00:50:54,365 --> 00:50:59,065
...came in trying to avenge her friend, but ended up getting bested by the best.

720
00:50:59,665 --> 00:51:03,365
Then, we had IRyS, my Nephilim friend—friends as we're both...

721
00:51:03,365 --> 00:51:06,365
...demons, kind of!

722
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:12,865
And then, last but not least, of course, we had Calliope Mori come in and...

723
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:16,565
...take my life, as she should have, because, wow, I was kind of...

724
00:51:16,565 --> 00:51:19,765
...I was kind of mean in that musical, don't you think?

725
00:51:19,765 --> 00:51:23,865
Not exactly the way that I usually am, so kind, but...

726
00:51:24,765 --> 00:51:27,765
Regardless, it was really fun.

727
00:51:27,765 --> 00:51:32,065
I came up with the idea for the story, and I wanted something that was like a little more exciting...

728
00:51:32,065 --> 00:51:36,465
...a little more chuunibyou, because deep down...

729
00:51:36,465 --> 00:51:39,965
...I am cringe, but I am free.

730
00:51:39,965 --> 00:51:44,165
So I hope you enjoyed the concept. We had amazing scriptwriters...

731
00:51:44,165 --> 00:51:48,965
...and just the whole team working on all of this was so amazing.

732
00:51:48,965 --> 00:51:52,565
So thank you for everyone who put in their efforts into this.

733
00:51:52,565 --> 00:51:56,565
Seriously means so much to me. And audience—Jailbirds...

734
00:51:56,565 --> 00:52:00,165
...thank you so much for watching. I hope you had a wonderful time.

735
00:52:00,165 --> 00:52:03,365
And now, it is time for an important announcement!

736
00:52:03,765 --> 00:52:07,965
This is my celebration merch: Nerissa Ravencroft 850,000 Subscribers Celebration!

737
00:52:07,965 --> 00:52:12,165
So let's go ahead and take a look at the details. Next up—or first up, I suppose...

738
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:17,665
...'Your assignment has arrived' Plush Blanket.

739
00:52:17,665 --> 00:52:22,765
This is a plush blanket featuring an illustration by basically my second mama...

740
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:27,765
...Yomosaka, at this point, who also did the promotional art, or the...

741
00:52:27,765 --> 00:52:32,765
...the, like, main cover art for this musical today.

742
00:52:32,765 --> 00:52:37,665
So it's very lovely. All of the merch today is going to be themed off of the DEO outfit.

743
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:42,665
Again, so beautiful, so gorgeous. You can cuddle up with it at night if you're feeling lonesome.

744
00:52:42,665 --> 00:52:45,365
So highly recommend grabbing it.

745
00:52:45,665 --> 00:52:48,865
Next up, we have the DEO Nerissa Voice Keychain.

746
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:53,965
This illustration is by Noka. This is a cute keychain, of course.

747
00:52:53,965 --> 00:52:59,165
You can carry it around with you everywhere. And in case you miss the sound of my voice...

748
00:52:59,165 --> 00:53:04,165
...it has my voice in it! About six different voice samples...

749
00:53:04,165 --> 00:53:09,165
...so you can click-click-click-click and hear me say different varying funny little things.

750
00:53:09,165 --> 00:53:11,765
So do consider it.

751
00:53:11,765 --> 00:53:17,165
Next up is the Nerissa Ravencroft Hand Puppet.

752
00:53:17,165 --> 00:53:22,165
I really wanted one, and I thought you guys would too, and especially...

753
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:27,065
...with the sexy DEO outfit, I just thought it made sense.

754
00:53:27,065 --> 00:53:32,765
Do think about the puppet shows that you could put on with me as your starring puppet.

755
00:53:32,765 --> 00:53:37,765
Think about it, consider the possibilities!

756
00:53:37,765 --> 00:53:41,565
So that is the—first one—that is one of the last ones, but next up...

757
00:53:41,565 --> 00:53:45,065
...is the last item, which is the 'Match with Me!' Necklace.

758
00:53:45,065 --> 00:53:49,865
This features the necklace from my DEO outfit. It is silver...

759
00:53:49,865 --> 00:53:54,965
...and it has a tiny amethyst-colored gem, because it's kind of hard to tell...

760
00:53:54,965 --> 00:54:00,165
...but the gem on my actual necklace is not red, it is actually kind of purply.

761
00:54:00,165 --> 00:54:03,665
So please look forward to it.

762
00:54:03,665 --> 00:54:08,465
Next up is the Complete Set Purchase Bonus, Limited Edition version.

763
00:54:08,465 --> 00:54:13,565
It's going to come with a postcard with a handwritten autograph by yours truly.

764
00:54:13,565 --> 00:54:18,765
And of course, the art is going to be the same one that's featured in the plush blanket...

765
00:54:18,765 --> 00:54:22,765
...the art by Yomosaka-san. So please do consider getting it...

766
00:54:22,765 --> 00:54:26,765
...if you want the whole set, if you want the limited set.

767
00:54:26,765 --> 00:54:30,765
Next up is the regular complete set. This is going to come with...

768
00:54:30,765 --> 00:54:35,665
...a postcard with a duplicated foil-stamped autograph by me...

769
00:54:35,665 --> 00:54:40,765
...in the case that you miss out on the limited, but you'll still get my signature either way, so don't worry too much.

770
00:54:40,765 --> 00:54:45,565
And both the limited and complete set are going to be coming with...

771
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:50,665
...a bonus voice pack called 'A Late Night at the Office' featuring me, of course...

772
00:54:50,665 --> 00:54:54,265
...and you, who works in my office, Jailbird.

773
00:54:54,265 --> 00:54:58,765
So that is all of my merchandise. Please, please buy it!

774
00:54:58,765 --> 00:55:03,365
I hope you like it. Again, this is a celebration for 850,000 and I would be remiss...

775
00:55:03,365 --> 00:55:05,865
...to not say that this is all thanks to you guys and your support.

776
00:55:05,865 --> 00:55:08,365
So thank you so, so much for supporting me.

777
00:55:02,926 --> 00:55:06,326
...following me, for watching my covers, for watching this today,

778
00:55:06,326 --> 00:55:09,526
watching my streams, commenting, everything you guys do, I'm so grateful.

779
00:55:09,526 --> 00:55:12,226
So thank you so much. So that's the...

780
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,226
...the final full set.

781
00:55:14,226 --> 00:55:16,226
And yeah, it's all good.

782
00:55:16,226 --> 00:55:18,426
So please buy it.

783
00:55:18,426 --> 00:55:20,526
I hope you guys like it.

784
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:21,926
I hope you're looking forward to receiving the items

785
00:55:21,926 --> 00:55:23,226
if you're buying it.

786
00:55:23,226 --> 00:55:25,426
They will go live right after this, I believe.

787
00:55:25,426 --> 00:55:28,026
So go ahead and check the description.

788
00:55:28,026 --> 00:55:30,626
It should have all the information right below.

789
00:55:30,626 --> 00:55:33,126
So thank you all so much, and that's that.

790
00:55:33,126 --> 00:55:36,226
So, I guess I should say goodbye.

791
00:55:36,226 --> 00:55:38,726
So... I don't want to, though.

792
00:55:38,726 --> 00:55:41,026
I'm having so much fun today,

793
00:55:41,026 --> 00:55:43,326
dancing with everyone and singing for you guys.

794
00:55:43,326 --> 00:55:46,026
But I'm so grateful I could spend time with you

795
00:55:46,026 --> 00:55:48,726
and share this special moment with you.

796
00:55:48,726 --> 00:55:51,226
I hope you guys all had a lot of fun,

797
00:55:51,226 --> 00:55:52,726
and I'll look forward to seeing you all

798
00:55:52,726 --> 00:55:54,226
in my next stream.

799
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:56,926
So for now, bye-bye, darlings!

800
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:22,393
REQUIEM FOR LOVE
