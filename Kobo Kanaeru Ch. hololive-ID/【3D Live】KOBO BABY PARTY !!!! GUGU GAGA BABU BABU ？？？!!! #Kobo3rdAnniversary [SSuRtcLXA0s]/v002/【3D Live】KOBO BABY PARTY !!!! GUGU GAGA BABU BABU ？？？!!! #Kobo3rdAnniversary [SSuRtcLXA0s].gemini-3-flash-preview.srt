Wait, why is it getting cloudy?

86
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:04,508
Kalau hujan gini kan nggak jadi keren.
If it rains like this, it won't be cool anymore.

87
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:09,508
Ni timing ujan nya nggak bisa di-delay apa? Hmm...
Can't the timing of this rain be delayed or something? Hmm...

88
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:14,508
Nggak bawa payung lagi.
Didn't bring an umbrella either.

89
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:19,508
Kasa... kasa pake gitar apa nggak ya? Jangan-jangan. Haah, shikata ga nai.
Umbrella... should I use the guitar as an umbrella? No, don't. Haah, it can't be helped.

Ya udah, shikata ga nai.
Oh well, it can't be helped.

91
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:29,008
Tanpa payung pun aku pasti bisa.
Even without an umbrella, I can do it.

102
00:09:45,008 --> 00:09:46,508

I know you can.

120
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:46,016
Just try, try, here, here.

121
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:49,016
We've done this before many years ago.

122
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:52,016
There you go! Wheee!

123
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:56,016

128
00:11:15,516 --> 00:11:18,016
Kuso gaki. Not again.
Brat. Not again.

129
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:28,516
Let's go, Bokobokobo.

130
00:11:28,516 --> 00:11:31,016
Let's go home, okay?

131
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:33,516
Here we are back...

132

At home!?

133
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:20,016
Oh my god!

134

What's going on? This is so chaotic!

135
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:27,516
Attention! Attention!

00:12:27,516 --> 00:12:30,516
Ai, ai, attention please.
Aye, aye, attention please.

137
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:35,016
Time for your first lesson, because apparently we're here with a lot of kids,

138
00:12:35,016 --> 00:12:38,516
but I think I would like some introductions first, okay?

139
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:41,016
So we have some order here. Let's try.

140
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:44,016
Okay, let's begin with...

141
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:47,516

00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:00,016
Yippee! Yippee!

145
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:03,016
Yippee! Your name is Yippee? Yippee! Okay, tada!

146
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,016
Very good, baby!

I go next to you.
I'll go next to you.

148
00:13:11,016 --> 00:13:14,016
Who are you? Huh? Introduction!

149
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:21,016
Biboo! Biboo!

150
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:25,016
Biboo!

151
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:27,016
Okay, good job. Thank you!

152
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,016
And who are you, cutie patootie? Hmm?

153
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:38,016
Lu-na! Lu-na!

154
00:13:42,516 --> 00:13:46,016
Okay, okay. And now, because I seem to not be able

155
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:49,016
to recognize my own child today, who are you?

156
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:55,016
Abababa! Abababa!

157
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:03,516
Abababa! Abababa!

158
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:06,516
Okay, I guess it was Kobo after all.

159
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:09,516
Good job everybody! Well done, you did so well!

160
00:14:13,516 --> 00:14:17,516
Kobo, do you remember who I am?

161
00:14:18,016 --> 00:14:22,016
Mama! Mama! Mama!

162
00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:25,516
Yes, Mama! But also known as Kiki-Riki,

163
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:28,516
I'm Takanashi Kiara from Hololive English Myth,

164
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:32,016
and today I seem to be the babysitter of this group.

165
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:36,016
But, but, but, chotto matte!
But, but, but, wait a minute!

166
00:14:36,016 --> 00:14:38,516
Why are these babies here anyway? What's going on?

167
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:46,016
I thought I made only Kobo into a baby
Koboだけを赤ちゃんにしたつもりも、
I thought I made only Kobo into a baby,

168
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:51,516
it seems that all the girls on this island have become babies!
この島にいた子みんな赤ちゃんになっちゃったみたい！
it seems that all the girls on this island have become babies!

00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,324
キアラ、子守り頼んだよ〜
Kiara, I'm counting on you to babysit~

172
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:04,854
Did you understand?

173
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:05,644
Babu?

174
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:06,174
Yeah!

175
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:07,154
わかった？
Understand?

176
00:15:07,154 --> 00:15:08,084
わかった？ Okay!
Understand? Okay!

177
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:10,604
Okay, doesn't matter.

178
00:15:10,604 --> 00:15:14,524
Everybody, I think we should play a game, yeah?

179
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:21,064
No problem.

180
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:22,324
I have an idea.

181
00:15:22,324 --> 00:15:24,494
We're gonna draw something over there.

182
00:15:24,494 --> 00:15:25,814
I'm gonna draw something...

183
00:15:25,814 --> 00:15:28,024
...and you all will guess what it is.

184
00:15:28,254 --> 00:15:29,824
Babu? Yeah?

185
00:15:30,434 --> 00:15:31,924
And if you get it right...

186
00:15:31,924 --> 00:15:34,224
...you will get a big cake! How about that?

187
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:45,624
Are you ready?

188
00:15:45,624 --> 00:15:46,424
Babu?

189
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:47,324
Yes!

190
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:51,624
Okay, we will start with Round One!

191
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:56,824
While I draw, you will behave, okay? Stay there?

192
00:15:56,824 --> 00:15:58,324
Okay? Start!

193
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:21,524
Sit, sit, here, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

194
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,324
Okay, it's finished.

195
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:26,524
Everybody, please take a look!

196
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:28,524
見て、見て！
Look, look!

197
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:30,824
What is this?

198
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,424
What is this, think!

199
00:16:34,524 --> 00:16:36,424
Okay, I will ask you now.

200
00:16:37,424 --> 00:16:39,524
Babu? What is this?

201
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:50,024
Nya! Nya! Nya! Oh!

202
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:51,324
ねこ！
Cat!

203
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:52,524
Cat!

204
00:16:52,524 --> 00:16:53,324
Oh!

205
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:55,724
I wonder...

206
00:16:56,524 --> 00:16:59,024
Maybe it's a potential answer.

207
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:01,024
もしかしたら、そうかもしれない...
Maybe it might be so...

208
00:17:01,524 --> 00:17:03,524
What does Kobo-chan think that this is?

209
00:17:15,524 --> 00:17:17,324
Wait, I don't think so.

210
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:19,524
But we will see. We will see.

211
00:17:19,824 --> 00:17:21,224
Pi-po-chan?

212
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:24,524
うんち！ うんち！
Poop! Poop!

213
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:28,924
Eh? Is my drawing that bad?

214
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,224
そんなに？
That much?

215
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,424
そんなにひどい？
Is it that bad?

216
00:17:32,524 --> 00:17:34,524
Oh, Kobo! Not unchi, right?
Oh, Kobo! Not poop, right?

217
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:36,524
What is this? Tell me.

218
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:48,024
い、い、い、い、いぬ！

Yes!

224
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:06,524
Okay, Round Two!

225
00:18:06,524 --> 00:18:08,524
Start time!

226
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:12,324
Okay, please behave, okay?

227
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,524
Shhh... Start!

228
00:18:39,024 --> 00:18:41,024
I've finished, I think. Oh, I finished.

229
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:42,324
Okay, babies...

230
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:44,224
Look at this! Ta-da!

231
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:54,424
Let's think, what could it be?

232
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:56,024
This doesn't look nice?

233
00:18:56,024 --> 00:18:58,224
Does it look like an animal?

234
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:00,524
Does it look like... hmm, let's see.

235
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:03,524
Luna, what do you think that that is?

236

Maybe!

239
00:19:15,524 --> 00:19:18,024

242
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:37,024
Oh, maybe, maybe, could be.

243
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:40,524
What do you think, people? What is that over there?

244
00:19:40,524 --> 00:19:43,324
Think, think, think.

245

バナナ！ バナナ！ バナナ！
Banana! Banana! Banana!

246

You know banana is yellow.

Okay, okay, Ollie-chan, please save me!

248
00:19:56,024 --> 00:19:57,324

Oh! Abu!

It's not so difficult, right?

262
00:21:18,032 --> 00:21:20,032
You know, right?

263
00:21:21,032 --> 00:21:23,532
How about this time, we ask Kobo first?

264
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,532
Hmm? What do you think that is?

265
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:28,532
You know it.

Okay. Probably...

I'll ask them too, okay?

275
00:21:48,032 --> 00:21:50,032
What do you think that is?

276
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:53,032

Calliope needs a little bit of work though.

483
00:40:09,364 --> 00:40:11,264
Wait, what is wrong? I need to talk to that curse.

484
00:40:11,764 --> 00:40:14,064

ちょっと ちょっと 寂しい時でも
Even when I feel a little bit lonely

521
00:43:04,464 --> 00:43:08,964
水たまり跳んで 君と遊んだら
If I jump in puddles and play with you

00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:56,964
おんなじ気持ち 一つ増えたら

さあコネクトしよう
Now, let's connect

549
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,497
I'm me, no more hiding now

550
00:45:29,095 --> 00:45:30,475
Hey hey!

551
00:45:30,475 --> 00:45:34,104
Changing, so I'm trying now

552
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:38,291
あれ今こう思っていて
Wait, I'm thinking this now

553
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:40,230
あ そうじゃなくて
Ah, no, that's not it

554
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:43,221
えと あの、言わないほうがいいなって
Um, well, I thought it's better not to say it

555
00:45:43,221 --> 00:45:45,407
だけど どうするんだっけ
But wait, what should I do?

556
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:50,120
沈黙がみちびきくる 鳴り止むオリオン
Silence leads the way, the fading Orion

557
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:52,486
コントロールZ 効かないし
Control-Z doesn't work

558
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:56,339
ブツブツカスタマイズ 足りない何か
Muttering about customization, something's missing

559
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:58,402
いっそ溶かせたらいいのにな
I wish I could just melt it away

560
00:45:58,402 --> 00:46:00,744
不完全不完全で
Being imperfect, being imperfect

561
00:46:00,744 --> 00:46:02,897
正解はなんだって
Whatever the right answer is

562
00:46:02,897 --> 00:46:05,050
不完全不完全で
Being imperfect, being imperfect

563
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:07,225
答えは僕だって
The answer is me

564
00:46:07,225 --> 00:46:10,590
名称なんてないよねまずは
There's no name for it yet, but first

565
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:12,679
始めてみようかな
I'll try starting it

566
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:14,842
違う形 違うカタチ
Different shapes, different forms

567
00:46:14,842 --> 00:46:16,955
なのにどうして同じ気持ち
Yet why do we feel the same?

568
00:46:16,955 --> 00:46:19,067
繋ぎ合ってる時間
The time we spend connected

569
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,877
解け合うぬくもりありがとう
Thank you for the warmth we share

570
00:46:21,877 --> 00:46:24,012
思い切り伝えたいんだ
I want to tell you with all my heart

571
00:46:24,012 --> 00:46:26,194
カラフル笑顔 届いていいな
I hope my colorful smile reaches you

572
00:46:26,194 --> 00:46:28,260
繋ぎ合ってるみんなと
With everyone I'm connected to

573
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:32,045
ここが私の好きな場所
This is my favorite place

574
00:46:33,322 --> 00:46:36,586
弾む心とピュアなテンション
A bouncing heart and pure energy

575
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:38,630
今コネクトしよう
Let's connect now

576
00:46:38,722 --> 00:46:42,181
I'm me, no more hiding now

577
00:46:43,784 --> 00:46:45,154
Hey hey!

578
00:46:45,154 --> 00:46:48,892
Changing, so I'm trying now

579
00:46:50,122 --> 00:46:54,175
一生懸命頑張ってみたって変われないって
Saying I can't change no matter how hard I try

580
00:46:54,454 --> 00:46:58,655
諦めトライしてみるって前段を無視して
Ignoring the fact I'm trying after giving up

581
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:04,175
平然な顔して デタラメなままで
With a calm face, staying nonsensical

582
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,473
思ったようにいかなくて
Things didn't go as planned

583
00:47:06,473 --> 00:47:08,586
ポッキリ折れてた
I was completely broken

584
00:47:08,586 --> 00:47:11,926
心もう一度躍らせていきたいな
I want to make my heart dance once more

585
00:47:12,084 --> 00:47:14,240
不完全不完全で
Being imperfect, being imperfect

586
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,396
今を信じたいんだ
I want to believe in now

587
00:47:16,396 --> 00:47:18,598
不完全不完全で
Being imperfect, being imperfect

588
00:47:18,598 --> 00:47:20,662
僕は僕なんだ
I am who I am

589
00:47:20,662 --> 00:47:24,027
正解と届かなくても一歩
Even if I don't reach the answer, one step

590
00:47:24,027 --> 00:47:26,227
踏み出してみようかな
I'll try taking it

591
00:47:26,227 --> 00:47:28,315
違う色と 違う夢で
With different colors and different dreams

592
00:47:28,315 --> 00:47:30,491
進む未来糸解いて素敵
Unraveling the threads of the future is lovely

593
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:32,489
見えない糸感じてる
I'm feeling an invisible thread

594
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:35,393
温かい優しさありがとう
Thank you for your warm kindness

595
00:47:35,393 --> 00:47:37,504
思い切り歌いたいんだ
I want to sing with all my heart

596
00:47:37,504 --> 00:47:39,639
ハッピー振れ笑顔 届けていいな
I hope I can deliver happy smiles

597
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:41,750
出会ってくれたオリジナル
The original version of us that met

598
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:45,463
みんなと大切な場所
A precious place with everyone

599
00:47:57,725 --> 00:48:00,743
一人でちゃんと自立してんだ
I'm properly independent on my own

600
00:48:00,988 --> 00:48:04,736
みんなと一緒に第一歩を踏み出せることが
But being able to take the first step with you all

601
00:48:04,984 --> 00:48:07,207
見つけていくから
I'll keep finding it

602
00:48:08,045 --> 00:48:13,698
Ah--

603
00:48:16,557 --> 00:48:18,671
違う形 違うカタチ
Different shapes, different forms

604
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:20,807
なのに本当だ同じ気持ち
Yet it's true, we feel the same

605
00:48:20,807 --> 00:48:22,870
繋ぎ合ってる時間
The time we spend connected

606
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:25,760
解け合うぬくもりありがとう
Thank you for the warmth we share

607

Arsy Widianto-kun?

679
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,080
Aku cuma pura-pura lupa aja.
I was just pretending to forget.

680
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:08,580
Jangan-jangan kamu beneran lupa ya, Bo?
Don't tell me you really forgot, Bo?

681
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:13,580
Hah? Aku... banyak yang sudah terjadi hari ini.

Kepala aku sedikit sakit.
My head hurts a bit.

00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,580
It's okay, Kobo. Nggak apa-apa.
It's okay, Kobo. It's fine.

684
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,080
Tapi kenapa ya perasaan ini familiar?
But why does this feeling feel familiar?

685
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,580
Seakan kita sudah saling kenal
As if we've known each other

686
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,080
satu sama lain sebelumnya.
before.

687

Maaf Arsy.
Sorry Arsy.

689
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:56,580
Sebenarnya aku ingin dekatmu
The truth is I want to be close to you

690
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:02,580
Namun kusadari ku tak bisa
But I realize that I can't

691
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,880
Tak boleh ku di sini
I shouldn't be here

692
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:13,080
Bahaya ku makin cinta
It's dangerous, I'm falling more in love

693
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,880
Ku tak ingin jauh
I don't want to be far away

694
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,080
Tak ingin berpisah
I don't want to part

695
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:26,080
Mengapa semua selalu indah
Why is everything always beautiful

696
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,080
Saat denganmu
When I'm with you

697
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:35,580
Sayang untuk diakhiri
It's a shame to end it

698
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,580
Andai engkau bisa mengerti
If only you could understand

699
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,080
Betapa beratnya aku
How hard it is for me

700
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,080
Harus aku tetap tersenyum
I have to keep smiling

701
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,580
Padahal hatiku terluka
Even though my heart is hurting

702
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,580
Adakah arti cinta ini
Is there any meaning to this love

703
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:00,080
Bila ku tak jadi denganmu
If I don't end up with you

704
00:55:00,504 --> 00:55:04,671
...memang ku harus pergi. Yakinlah...
...that I must go. Believe that...

705
00:55:04,671 --> 00:55:08,088
...hatiku kamu.
...my heart is yours.

706
00:55:10,588 --> 00:55:16,921
Bukankah semesta yang pertemukan kita?
Didn't the universe bring us together?

707
00:55:17,671 --> 00:55:21,921
Harus kau sampaikan...
You must tell...

708
00:55:21,921 --> 00:55:26,504
...pada bintang.
...the stars.

709
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:32,504
Mengapa bukan kamu yang memiliki aku?
Why it's not you who has me?

710
00:55:33,088 --> 00:55:35,921
Andai engkau bisa mengerti...
If only you could understand...

711
00:55:35,921 --> 00:55:39,671
Betapa beratnya aku...
How hard it is for me...

712
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:44,338
Harus aku tetap tersenyum...
That I must keep smiling...

713
00:55:44,338 --> 00:55:48,088
Padahal hatiku terluka.
Even though my heart is wounded.

714
00:55:48,338 --> 00:55:52,338
Ada tak hati cinta ini...
Is there any love in this heart...

715
00:55:52,338 --> 00:55:55,838
...bila ku tak jadi denganmu?
...if I don't end up with you?

716
00:55:55,921 --> 00:55:59,338
Jika memang ku harus pergi...
If I indeed must go...

717
00:55:59,338 --> 00:56:06,588
Yakinlah hatiku kamu.
Believe that my heart is yours.

718
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:14,421
Mengapa cinta pertemukan...
Why did love bring us together...

719
00:56:14,421 --> 00:56:21,921
...bila akhirnya dipisahkan?
...if in the end we are separated?

720
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:29,921
Dan mengapa ku jatuh cinta...
And why did I fall in love...

721
00:56:30,088 --> 00:56:38,338
Pada cinta yang tak jatuh padaku?
With a love that didn't fall for me?

722
00:56:45,171 --> 00:56:48,671
Harus aku tetap tersenyum...
I must keep smiling...

723
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:52,338
...padahal hatiku terluka.
...even though my heart is wounded.

724
00:56:52,671 --> 00:56:56,921
Ada tak hati cinta ini...
Is there any love in this heart...

725
00:56:56,921 --> 00:57:00,754
...bila ku tak jadi denganmu?
...if I don't end up with you?

726
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:04,671
Jika memang ku harus pergi...
If I indeed must go...

727
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:11,921
Yakinlah hatiku kamu.
Believe that my heart is yours.

728
00:57:12,338 --> 00:57:15,671
Kamu...
You...

729
00:57:15,921 --> 00:57:19,504
Harus aku tetap tersenyum...
I must keep smiling...

730
00:57:19,504 --> 00:57:23,588
...padahal hatiku terluka.
...even though my heart is wounded.

731
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:27,588
Ada tak hati cinta ini...
Is there any love in this heart...

732
00:57:27,588 --> 00:57:30,921
...bila ku tak jadi denganmu?
...if I don't end up with you?

733
00:57:31,004 --> 00:57:34,504
Jika memang ku harus pergi...
If I indeed must go...

734
00:57:34,504 --> 00:57:44,671
Yakinlah hatiku kamu.
Believe that my heart is yours.

735
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:50,171
Yakinlah cinta...
Believe that this love...

736
00:57:50,671 --> 00:57:57,171
...untukmu.

761
00:59:10,671 --> 00:59:13,338
Tapi sayangnya cuma bentar.
Unfortunately it's only for a short while.

762
00:59:13,421 --> 00:59:17,171
Aku sebenarnya masih pengen lebih lama sih sama kamu.
I actually still want to spend more time with you.

766
00:59:25,754 --> 00:59:27,671
...ini dari hati aja apa adanya.
...speaking from the heart, as it is.

767
00:59:29,671 --> 00:59:31,671
Eh tapi pantesan lagu-lagunya tuh...
But no wonder your songs are...

768
00:59:31,754 --> 00:59:34,671
Aku tuh nggak bisa tau. Aku tuh pernah nulis lagu...
I can't do it, you know. I once tried writing a song...

769
00:59:34,754 --> 00:59:36,671
...romantis gitu, cuma tuh nggak bisa.
...romantic like that, but I couldn't.

770
00:59:37,671 --> 00:59:40,671
Aku tuh harus ngebayanginnya tuh fake gitu loh.
I had to imagine it being fake.

771
00:59:40,754 --> 00:59:42,671
