13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The moment we've all been waiting for...

14
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,800
5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

15
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:34,000
Ha-a-ha-a-a...

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,500
こんなことなるなんて　会う前にわかってたら
If I'd known it would turn out like this before we met...

17
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:48,500
もう少しだけ　しゃんとした僕を　見せられたはずなんだ
I should have been able to show you a slightly more proper version of myself.

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,500
どうしたらいいのかなんて　頭ではわかってるけど
I know in my head what I should do, but...

19
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:04,000
何気ないちょっとした言葉で
With just a casual word or two...

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,500
嬉し顔が出ちゃって　こんなバレバレじゃ格好悪いな
A happy face slips out; it's so obvious, it's embarrassing.

21
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:19,000
けどこのままじゃ引き下がれないよな　今も顔が照れくさくて
But I can't just back down like this, even now my face is blushing.

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,500
あなたのことが好きだなんて言えないんです　この気持ち伝わったら
I can't say that I love you; if these feelings got through...

23
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:34,000
嬉しいだって怖いから　何も言えずまたさよなら
Because I'm happy but also scared, I say goodbye again without saying a word.

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,500
あなたのことが好きすぎてたまらないんです　明日こそは言えるかな
I love you so much I can't help it; I wonder if I'll be able to say it tomorrow.

25
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:50,000
あなたも僕に同じように　恋してたらなんて考えちゃうな
I can't help but think, what if you were in love with me too?

26
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:04,000
会えない日が続いてる　このままじゃよろしくない
The days we can't meet continue; this isn't good.

27
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,500
会ったところで何ができるってわけじゃないんだけど
It's not like I can do much even if we did meet, but...

28
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:19,000
こんな恋は二度とないな　頭ではわかってるけど
A love like this will never happen again; I know it in my head, but...

29
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,500
眩しすぎるその笑顔が
That smile of yours is too dazzling.

30
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:34,000
僕を焦らせるんだ　ずっと見ていたくなるような
It makes me feel impatient; I want to keep looking at it forever.

31
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,500
見逃したくなくなってしまうような　こんな気持ちわかるのかな
Like I don't want to miss a thing; I wonder if you understand these feelings.

32
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:49,000
あなたが笑ってるなら　それでいいんです　でも隣は僕がいいな
If you're laughing, that's enough for me; but I wish I was the one beside you.

33
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,500
もしかしたら実は　ずっと気づいてるんじゃないかな
Maybe you've actually known all along.

34
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,000
あなたのことが好きすぎてたまらないんです
I love you so much I can't help it.

35
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:03,548
言えるかな
Can I say it?

36
00:05:03,548 --> 00:05:07,348
全てをひっくり返すくらいの一番なセリフは
The best line that would turn everything upside down

37
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,748
言えそうにないや
Doesn't seem like I can say it

38
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:29,348
どうしてもこの気持ちは
No matter what, this feeling

39
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:33,648
抑えられそうにはないんだ
Doesn't seem like it can be suppressed

40
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:37,548
あなたと出会ったあの日から
From that day I met you

41
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:41,348
ずっと気持ちは変わらないけど
My feelings haven't changed, but...

42
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,348
あなたのことが好きだなんて言えないんです
I can't say I like you

43
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:56,248
この気持ち伝わるかな
I wonder if these feelings will reach you

44
00:05:56,248 --> 00:06:00,048
足掻いたって空回り
Struggling, I just go in circles

45
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:03,648
何も言えずまたさよなら
Can't say anything, so goodbye again

46
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:07,448
あなたのことが好きすぎて堪らないんです
I love you so much I can't stand it

47
00:06:07,448 --> 00:06:11,348
明日こそは言いたいな
I want to say it tomorrow for sure

48
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:14,948
あなたも僕と同じように
If you, just like me,

49
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:19,548
恋してたらなんて考えてる
Were in love, I'm thinking...

50
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,048
でも分かってる
But I know

51
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:26,648
考えすぎってこと
That I'm overthinking it

52
00:06:51,448 --> 00:06:57,548
Kobo Kanaeru at your service. Let me be your sun to shine your day!

フロア見て、わあ！なんかパターン...
Look at the floor, wow! Some kind of pattern...

83

とくべっちゅして
Give me a special kiss

Oh baby I love you じゃ足りない
Oh baby I love you is not enough

99
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,590
一番大違い
The biggest difference

100
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,090
君が作るオリジナルの
The original one you make

101
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,590
とくべっちゅして
Give me a special kiss

102
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,540

夕焼け色、君がいる (Oh yeah)
In the sunset color, you are there (Oh yeah)

108
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,690
全てに触れずに
Without touching everything

109
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,140
二人だけでいよう
Let's be just the two of us

110

私のこと苦戦して
Struggle over me

なんでもある日の
On a day where everything exists

113
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,140
なんでもないキスしてね
Give me an ordinary kiss, okay?

114

Oh baby I love you じゃ足りない
Oh baby I love you is not enough

私を想ってほしい
I want you to think of me

広い街吸い込まれ (Oh yeah)
Being sucked into the wide city (Oh yeah)

大きな花丸だね
A big perfect score mark

130
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,190
好きなところ 優しいところ
Things I like, your kind side

嫌いなところも 優しいところ
Even things I hate, are your kind side

132
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,190
誰にもあげない
I won't give it to anyone

133
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,740
私だけ独り占め
I'll keep you all to myself

134
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,240
だって今までの人と
Because, compared to people until now

135
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,240
同じはいらないんです
I don't need the same thing

136
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,240
ねえもっと give me more love 私のため
Hey, give me more love, for my sake

137
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,790
生きてほしいんです
I want you to live

138
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,290
だからウサギと私は
That's why, like a rabbit and me

139
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,290
寂しくさせないで
Don't make me feel lonely

140
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,290
それじゃ束縛じゃないわ
That's not being possessive

141
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,790
苦しいのが好き

610
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,572
簡単だよー！
It's easy!

611
00:43:24,172 --> 00:43:25,972

ファイトー！

623
00:43:54,572 --> 00:43:57,172
じゃ、バイバイ！
Well, bye bye!

624
00:43:59,172 --> 00:44:02,172
みんな行っちゃった...
Everyone's gone...

625
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:06,172
寂しい...寂しい...
I'm lonely... I'm lonely...

626
00:44:06,172 --> 00:44:10,172
誰も来ないのかな...
I wonder if anyone else is coming...

627
00:44:25,972 --> 00:44:28,772
でも、
But,

628
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:41,972
サヨナラの前にキスをして
Kiss me before we say goodbye

629
00:44:41,972 --> 00:44:47,172
サヨナラの後は忘れさせて
Let me forget after we say goodbye

630
00:44:47,172 --> 00:44:52,572
でもあなたの名前が消えない
But your name won't disappear

631
00:44:52,572 --> 00:44:59,172
離れない 離さない 戻りたい
Don't leave, I won't let go, I want to go back

632
00:44:59,172 --> 00:45:01,572
Take me free この恋は...
Take me free, this love is...

633
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,619
止まった色味 部屋の中は香水だらけに染めた
Faded hues, the room is stained with the scent of perfume

634
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:09,919
Jusqu'à l'infini Flavor
Until the infinite flavor

635
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:12,419
当たり前さえも奇跡
Even the ordinary is a miracle

636
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:15,419
当たり障りのない君との奇跡
A safe miracle spent with you

637
00:45:15,919 --> 00:45:17,919
どれだけ恋しっても
No matter how much I love you

638
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,619
越えられない君を
I still can't reach you

639
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:25,619
今ならわかる気がして
I feel like I understand now

640
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:30,619
今から過去にも戻れるなら
If I could return to the past from here

641
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:36,319
サヨナラの前にキスをして
Kiss me before we say goodbye

642
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:41,919
サヨナラの後は忘れさせて
After goodbye, let me forget

643
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:47,319
でもあなたの名前が消えない
But your name won't disappear

644
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:52,119
離れない 離さない 戻りたい
Can't leave, won't let go, want to go back

645
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:55,919
Take me free

646
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:01,619
愛したい ほど愛しているのよ
I love you as much as I want to love you

647
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,119
気づけばあなたのことばかり浮かべて
Before I know it, I'm only thinking of you

648
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:12,119
明日になれば大丈夫
Everything will be okay tomorrow

649
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:17,619
何度言い聞かせればいいの
How many times must I tell myself?

650
00:46:19,419 --> 00:46:24,319
愛という沼に溺れてる
I'm drowning in the swamp of love

651
00:46:24,919 --> 00:46:28,919
私の声は届かない
My voice doesn't reach you

652
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:35,019
サヨナラの前にキスをして
Kiss me before we say goodbye

653
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,519
サヨナラの後は忘れさせて
After goodbye, let me forget

654
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,819
でもあなたの名前が消えない
But your name won't disappear

655
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:51,619
離れない 離さない 戻りたい Take me
Can't leave, won't let go, want to go back, take me

656
00:46:52,419 --> 00:46:57,019
サヨナラの前にキスをして
Kiss me before we say goodbye

657
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:02,419
サヨナラの後は忘れさせて
After goodbye, let me forget

658
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,819
でもあなたの名前が消えない
But your name won't disappear

659
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:14,619
離れない 離さない 戻れない Take me free
Can't leave, won't let go, can't go back, take me free

660
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:45,619
変えられない日々 抱きしめたまま
While embracing the days that cannot be changed

661

662
00:47:46,219 --> 00:47:50,419
いつか そう いつか
Someday, yes, someday

663
00:47:51,419 --> 00:47:55,419
弱い心が 捕まる前に
Before my weak heart gets caught

664
00:47:56,019 --> 00:48:00,019
そっと あなたを遠ざけた
I quietly kept you away

665
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:20,019
ああ こんな気持ち
Ah, this feeling

666
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:24,619
辛すぎるよ もう
It's too painful now

667
00:48:26,019 --> 00:48:30,019
あなたは誰なの
Who are you?

668
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:34,619
どこに隠れてたの
Where were you hiding?

669
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:39,619
ひどく怯えてる
I'm terribly frightened

670
00:48:40,419 --> 00:48:44,419
うつむいたままの
With head held down

671
00:48:45,419 --> 00:48:49,419
見失った私が
I, who lost sight

672
00:48:50,419 --> 00:48:53,119
泣いてた
Was crying

673
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:57,119
またあの季節
That season again

674
00:48:57,619 --> 00:48:59,619
夜空は白く
The night sky is white

675
00:49:00,219 --> 00:49:02,919
あなたもいて
You were there too

676
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:06,919
触れてこないで
Don't touch me

677
00:49:07,419 --> 00:49:09,119
嬉しいけど
I'm happy, but...

678
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:13,619
心が痛い
My heart hurts

679
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,419
離したくない
I don't want to let go

680
00:49:18,919 --> 00:49:20,919
離れたくない
I don't want to leave

681
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:25,119
でも諦めてた
But I had given up

682
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:30,419
もうこれ以上 好きになれない
I can't love you any more than this

683
00:49:31,019 --> 00:49:35,019
失う痛み 耐えきれないよ
I can't bear the pain of losing you

684
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:39,719
変えられない日々 抱きしめたまま
While embracing the days that cannot be changed

685
00:49:40,419 --> 00:49:44,419
いつか そう いつか
Someday, yes, someday

686
00:49:45,419 --> 00:49:49,419
ただそばにいて それだけでいい
Just stay by my side, that's enough

687
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:54,119
素直にはなれないけれど
Though I cannot be true to my feelings

688
00:50:04,011 --> 00:50:06,251
さあ　顔を上げて
Now, lift your head.

689
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:12,131
歩み始めなきゃ
You have to start moving forward.

690
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:17,531
リアルな私を　気づいて
Please notice the real me.

691
00:50:22,571 --> 00:50:27,531
またあの季節　この空の下
Once again, in that season, under this sky...

692
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,931
見上げている
...I'm looking up.

693
00:50:32,451 --> 00:50:35,211
傷ついたもの
The things that were hurt...

694
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:37,291
もう元には
...cannot be returned...

695
00:50:37,411 --> 00:50:43,211
戻らないけれど
...to how they were, but...

696
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:47,211
離したくない
I don't want to let go.

697
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:49,691
離れたくない
I don't want to be apart.

698
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:54,291
もう諦めない
I won't give up anymore.

699
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:57,171
あなたの心
Even if I have to...

700
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:59,611
傷つけてでも
...hurt your heart...

701
00:50:59,731 --> 00:51:03,851
この気持ちに嘘はつけない
...I can't lie to these feelings.

702
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:06,851
いつか笑顔で
So that someday...

703
00:51:06,971 --> 00:51:09,411
話せるような
...we can talk with a smile...

704
00:51:09,531 --> 00:51:13,411
私を見つけて
...please find me.

705
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:16,051
隣にいて
Stay by my side...

706
00:51:16,171 --> 00:51:18,811
聞かせてほしい
...I want you to tell me...

707
00:51:18,931 --> 00:51:23,811
二度と独りにはしないと
...that you'll never leave me alone again.

708
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:49,731
帰らない日々
While still holding onto...

709
00:51:49,891 --> 00:51:52,331
抱きしめたまま
...the days that won't return...

710
00:51:52,451 --> 00:51:56,571
きっとそうきっと
...surely, yes, surely...

711
00:51:56,691 --> 00:52:00,331
あの日の気持ち受け止めないと
...if I don't accept my feelings from that day...

712
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:06,131
前に進むことができない
...I won't be able to move forward.

713
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,611
離したくない
I don't want to let go.

714
00:52:08,731 --> 00:52:11,091
離れたくない
I don't want to be apart.

715
00:52:11,251 --> 00:52:15,651
一つの願いは
My one wish...

716
00:52:15,811 --> 00:52:19,291
大好きだよと伝えたいだけ
...is just to tell you that I love you.

717
00:52:19,451 --> 00:52:26,411
本当素直じゃないけれど
Even though I'm really not honest with myself.

718
00:53:34,371 --> 00:53:36,871
So... (laughter)

719
00:53:37,171 --> 00:53:40,171
How is it guys?

720
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:43,171
Then as closing...

721
00:53:43,371 --> 00:53:47,171
Did you take a lot of screenshots?

722
00:53:47,471 --> 00:53:50,971
And ah, how about my new stage?

723
00:53:54,871 --> 00:53:57,371
It's very cloudy here.

724
00:53:57,571 --> 00:54:01,971
Yeah, as you can see, there's two big chill-outs on the left and right.

725
00:54:02,971 --> 00:54:07,371
So cute, right?

726
00:54:07,771 --> 00:54:11,971
みんなどうだった？コボのパフォーマンス。
How was it everyone? Kobo's performance.

727
00:54:12,071 --> 00:54:15,171
いっぱいスクリーンショット撮れたかな？
Were you able to take a lot of screenshots?

728
00:54:15,271 --> 00:54:19,771
コボの新しいステージはどうだった？可愛いでしょ？
How was Kobo's new stage? It's cute, right?

729
00:54:19,971 --> 00:54:26,171
ビッグチルズがありますので、めっちゃ可愛いよね？
Since there are big Chills, it's super cute, isn't it?

730
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:32,171
So actually, yeah, we're already at the end of the show, guys.

731
00:54:32,371 --> 00:54:37,271
そろそろお別れの時間になりますよ。
It's almost time to say goodbye.

732
00:54:37,571 --> 00:54:39,771
But don't worry.

733
00:54:39,971 --> 00:54:43,771
Kobo still has something to share with you guys.

734
00:54:43,971 --> 00:54:47,071
まだ皆にお知らせがあります。
I still have an announcement for everyone.

735
00:54:47,471 --> 00:54:50,271

I've wanted to wear a jellyfish costume for a long time.

741
00:55:10,351 --> 00:55:13,151
And finally, my wish came true!

742
00:55:13,551 --> 00:55:15,451
So, how is it, guys?

743
00:55:15,751 --> 00:55:17,651
Do I look beautiful?

00:55:17,851 --> 00:55:21,151

And you can see there's Chillers in the front...

758
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:02,151

00:56:46,251 --> 00:56:50,851
...and the other is an illustration I drew by myself.

772
00:56:51,151 --> 00:56:53,651
Yeah, by myself.

773
00:56:53,851 --> 00:56:56,851
It looks good, right? Do you like it?

774
00:56:57,151 --> 00:56:59,851
I drew it by myself.

775
00:57:00,151 --> 00:57:04,651
So you can pin them to your bag...

776
00:57:04,751 --> 00:57:09,151
...or your hat, or your heart.

777
00:57:10,151 --> 00:57:15,851
Okay, so this one is one of my favorites.

778
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:20,651
One, two, three... Ta-da! The plushie keychain!

779
00:57:18,651 --> 00:57:48,651
Jellyfish Princess Kobo Plushie Keychain

780
00:57:20,951 --> 00:57:25,851
It's me! But mini Kobo in mini form.

781
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:29,151
You can bring me anywhere.

782
00:57:29,251 --> 00:57:37,151
On your backpack, your keys, your motorcycle, the car, whatever.

783
00:57:37,551 --> 00:57:41,151
Even next to your computer while you watch my streams.

784
00:57:41,551 --> 00:57:45,151
Soft and squishy.

785
00:57:46,451 --> 00:57:50,151
And finally, we also have the...

786
00:57:48,651 --> 00:58:21,651
Voice Pack / Situational Voice Pack / “Your One and Only Jellyfish Princess”

787
00:57:50,251 --> 00:57:54,451
...Situational Voice Pack.

788
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:59,451
So it's called "Your One and Only Jellyfish Princess".

789
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:06,451
What does it mean? Buy it! Buy it, okay?

790
00:58:06,951 --> 00:58:13,651
Yippee, it's a special voice pack where I talk to you...

791
00:58:13,851 --> 00:58:17,151
...about Jellyfish Princess.

792
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:21,151
And you know, your one and only just for you.

793
00:58:21,651 --> 00:58:39,651
Set Purchase Bonus / Autographed instant photo-style card

794
00:58:21,851 --> 00:58:25,151
If you buy a set of them...

795
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:29,151
...you'll get a special bromate with my signature on it.

796
00:58:29,651 --> 00:58:31,851
The merch is available for a limited time only.

797
00:58:32,151 --> 00:58:36,151
So you can grab yours from the official shop.

798
00:58:36,251 --> 00:58:40,151
Links are in the description.

799
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:44,151
So yeah, that's all for the announcement.

800
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:52,651
Thank you for coming and watching Kobo perform today.

801
00:58:53,151 --> 00:58:56,151
以上、こぼ・かなえるのお知らせでした。
That concludes the announcements from Kobo Kanaeru.

802
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:01,651
説明欄やチャット欄にリンクを貼ってありますので、
I've put the links in the description and chat section,

803
00:59:02,151 --> 00:59:06,151
クリックしてね！
so please check them out!

804
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:10,151
Oh yeah, but I can hear some of you want an encore.

805
00:59:10,251 --> 00:59:15,151
Encore, encore, encore hoshii?
Encore, encore, do you want an encore?

806
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:18,151
じゃあ、しょうがないわ。
Well, I guess I have no choice.

807
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:43,651
Please listen, Sweet Memories.

808
00:59:58,651 --> 01:00:04,651
Sweet Memories

809
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:07,001
Sweet Memories

810
01:00:12,511 --> 01:00:19,381
なつかしい 痛みだわ
It's a nostalgic pain

811
01:00:20,521 --> 01:00:26,451
ずっと前に 忘れていた
That I had long ago forgotten

812
01:00:28,511 --> 01:00:32,421
でも あなたを 見たとき
But when I saw you

813
01:00:33,511 --> 01:00:40,481
時間だけ 後戻りしたの
Only time went back

814
01:00:43,521 --> 01:00:48,431
幸せ？と 聞かないで
Don't ask me "Are you happy?"

815
01:00:49,531 --> 01:00:56,451
嘘つくのは 上手じゃない
I'm not good at lying

816
01:00:57,511 --> 01:01:03,421
友達なら いるけれど
I have friends, but...

817
01:01:03,511 --> 01:01:10,431
あんなには 燃え上がれなくて
I can't burn with passion like that

818
01:01:11,521 --> 01:01:16,451
失った 夢だけが
Only the dreams I've lost

819
01:01:17,531 --> 01:01:25,481
美しく 見えるのは なぜかしら
Why is it that they look so beautiful?

820
01:01:26,521 --> 01:01:33,431
過ぎ去った 優しさも 今は
Even the kindness of the past, now

821
01:01:34,521 --> 01:01:42,481
甘い記憶 Sweet memories
Is a sweet memory, sweet memories

822
01:01:54,511 --> 01:02:00,451
キスしたら いけないわ
I mustn't kiss you

823
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:08,451
傷をひとつ 増やすだけよ
It will only add one more wound

824
01:02:10,511 --> 01:02:16,451
長いあいだ あなたに
For a long time, to you

825
01:02:17,521 --> 01:02:24,481
会いたくて 泣いていたくせに
Even though I was crying because I wanted to see you

826
01:02:25,511 --> 01:02:30,421
あの頃は 若すぎて
Back then, we were too young

827
01:02:31,511 --> 01:02:38,451
いたずらに 傷つけあったふたり
We hurt each other for no reason

828
01:02:39,521 --> 01:02:45,431
色あせた 悲しみも 今は
Even the faded sadness, now

829
01:02:46,521 --> 01:02:55,481
甘い記憶 Sweet memories
Is a sweet memory, sweet memories

830
01:03:33,511 --> 01:03:36,421
失った
I've lost

831
01:03:33,511 --> 01:03:36,421
失った
I've lost

832
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:39,431
夢だけが
Only the dreams

833
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:39,431
夢だけが
Only the dreams

834
01:03:40,521 --> 01:03:47,481
美しく 見えるのは なぜかしら
Why is it that they look so beautiful?

835
01:03:48,511 --> 01:03:54,431
過ぎ去った 優しさも 今は

836
01:03:55,521 --> 01:04:04,481
甘い記憶 Sweet memories
Is a sweet memory, sweet memories

837
01:04:48,001 --> 01:04:53,001
フィナーレ
Finale

838
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:03,421
君は 本当に
You really...

839
01:05:03,511 --> 01:05:05,451
分かってない
...don't understand

840
01:05:05,321 --> 01:08:47,321
フィナーレ
Finale

841
01:05:05,971 --> 01:05:08,771
たとえば Happy End より
For example, more than a Happy End

842
01:05:10,471 --> 01:05:15,771
甘くて豪華なデザートより
More than a sweet and luxurious dessert

843
01:05:16,471 --> 01:05:19,671
君がいいんだよ
It's you that I want

844
01:05:22,471 --> 01:05:26,871
二つの傘より相合傘
More than two umbrellas, sharing one

845
01:05:27,671 --> 01:05:32,071
ちょっと冷たいけど愛するための
It's a bit cold, but if it's the price

846
01:05:32,571 --> 01:05:37,771
代償ならいくらでもどうぞ
To love you, then take as much as you want

847
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:41,771
ただずっとそばにいたい
I just want to be by your side forever

848
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:46,671
ねぇ誰を欲しがったって問題ない
Hey, no matter who you want, it's not a problem

849
01:05:47,171 --> 01:05:53,771
二人ぼっちのセカイでずっと
In this world where it's just the two of us, forever

850
01:05:54,571 --> 01:05:59,971
最後の花火を上げて フィナーレを飾って
Light up the final fireworks and decorate the finale

851
01:06:00,471 --> 01:06:05,771
奇跡の降る恋に落ちて
Fall into a love where miracles fall

852
01:06:06,271 --> 01:06:09,571
誰も離さないで
Don't let anyone go

853
01:06:10,471 --> 01:06:15,871
味気ないセカイも悪くないね
A tasteless world isn't so bad either

854
01:06:16,471 --> 01:06:21,971
どんなに恋をしたって出会えないよきっと
No matter how much you love, we'll surely never meet again

855
01:06:22,471 --> 01:06:28,571
終わりもない 幸せにキスをしよう
Let's kiss our never-ending happiness

856
01:06:40,171 --> 01:06:43,671
いつか今日を忘れても
Even if I forget today one day

857
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:48,671
君がいいんだよ
It's you that I want

858
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:55,671
土砂降りの日 愛おしく初めて目が合った
On a day of pouring rain, we lovingly met eyes for the first time

859
01:06:56,271 --> 01:07:01,571
ずっと 覚えておくよ
I'll remember it forever

860
01:07:27,471 --> 01:07:31,671
ねぇ誰を欲しがったって問題ない
Hey, no matter who you want, it's not a problem

861
01:07:32,171 --> 01:07:37,971
二人ぼっちのセカイでずっと

最後の花火を上げて フィナーレを誓って
Light up the final fireworks and vow for the finale

863
01:07:43,271 --> 01:07:48,671
奇跡の降る恋に落ちて
Fall into a love where miracles fall

864
01:07:49,171 --> 01:07:53,671

Don't let anyone go

865
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:58,671
素っ気ないセカイも悪くないね

869
01:08:39,171 --> 01:08:42,671
でもそれがね
But you know, that is

870
01:08:43,171 --> 01:08:47,171
二人の幸せ
Our happiness

871
01:08:56,971 --> 01:09:00,071
Oh my God, I almost cried.

872
01:09:00,571 --> 01:09:03,771
I almost cried singing this song.

873
01:09:04,271 --> 01:09:06,771

And thank you for Zeta-senpai because she covered this finale song first...

01:09:15,971 --> 01:09:19,871

01:09:20,271 --> 01:09:22,771
Aku bolak-balik dengerin ini terus, hehehe.
