00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,000
The night shines brighter when she sings...

3
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Special guests are here to join the fun

4
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
so don't blink

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The moment we've all been waiting for...

6
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
あぁ、ふわふわ...
Ah, fluff fluff...

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
こんなことにな
I never thought

13
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
るなんて
it would happen

14
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
出会う前にわかってたら
If only I knew before we met

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
もう少しだけシャンとした僕を
I could have shown you a cooler side of me

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
見せれたはずなんだ
I'm sure I could have

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
どうしたらいいのかなんて
What should I do?

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
頭ではわかってるけど
I know it in my head, but

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
何気ないちょっとした言葉で
Just from your casual words

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
わぁ、おっ、おっ
Wah, oh, oh

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
嬉しい顔が出ちゃって
A happy face just slips out

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
こんなバレバレじゃカッコ悪いな
It's so uncool to be this obvious

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
けどこのままじゃ引き下がれないよな
But I can't back down now

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
でも今更カッコつけて照れくさくて
But now it's embarrassing to try and look cool

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
あなたのことが好きだなんて言えないんです
I can't say that I like you

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
この気持ち伝わるかな
Will these feelings reach you?

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
浮き足立って空回り
I'm restless and spinning my wheels

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
何も言えずまたさよなら
Saying goodbye again without saying anything

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
あなたのことが好きすぎてたまらないんです
I like you so much it's unbearable

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
明日こそは言えるかな
Will I be able to say it tomorrow?

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
あなたも僕に同じように
If you felt the same way about me

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
恋してたら
If you were in love

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
なんて考えちゃうんだ
That's what I end up thinking

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
会えない日が続いてる
Days without seeing you continue

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
このままじゃよろしくない
This isn't good

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
会ったところで何ができるって
Not that I can do anything if we meet

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
わけじゃないんだけど
It's not like that, but

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
こんな恋は二度とないな
I'll never have a love like this again

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
頭ではわかってるけど
I know it in my head, but

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
眩しすぎその笑顔が
That smile is too bright

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
わぁ、おっ、おっ
Wah, oh, oh

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
僕を焦らせるんだ
It makes me panic

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
ずっと見ていたくなるような
I want to keep watching you forever

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
独り占めしたくなってしまうよな
I start wanting to have you all to myself

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
こんな気持ちわかるのかな
Do you understand these feelings?

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
あなたが笑ってるならそれでいいんです
If you are smiling, then that's enough

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
でも隣は僕がいいな
But I wish I was the one next to you

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
もしかしたら実は
Maybe, actually

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
ずっと気づいてる
You've noticed all along

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
じゃないかな
Haven't you?

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
あなたのことが好きすぎてたまらないんです
I like you so much it's unbearable

52
00:05:04,548 --> 00:05:08,048
手をひっくり返すくらいの
Like turning over a hand,

53
00:05:08,248 --> 00:05:10,448
粋なセリフは
such a witty line...

54
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:13,748
言えそうにないや
I don't think I can say.

55
00:05:26,648 --> 00:05:29,748
どうしたってこの気持ちは
No matter what, these feelings...

56
00:05:29,748 --> 00:05:33,748
抑えられそうにはないんだ
cannot be suppressed.

57
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:37,748
あなたと出会ったあの日から
Since the day I met you,

58
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:42,048
ずっと気持ちは変わらないけど
my feelings haven't changed, but...

59
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:53,048
あなたのことが好きだなんて言えないんです
I can't say that I love you.

60
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:56,748
この気持ち伝わるかな
Will these feelings reach you?

61
00:05:57,248 --> 00:06:00,048
浮き足立って空回り
Restless and spinning in circles,

62
00:06:00,748 --> 00:06:03,548
何も言えずまたサヨナラ
saying nothing, and it's goodbye again.

63
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:08,248
あなたのことが好きすぎてたまらないんです
I love you so much it's unbearable.

64
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:11,748
明日こそは言いたいな
I want to say it tomorrow for sure.

65
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:15,048
あなたも僕に同じように
If you also felt the same way about me...

66
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:17,248
恋してたら
...and fell in love,

67
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:20,748
なんて考えてる
...I'm thinking about things like that.

68
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,248
でも分かってる
But I know,

69
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:26,748
考えすぎってこと
I'm just overthinking it.

70
00:06:27,748 --> 00:06:30,248
Oh, oh, oh...

71
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:34,248
Oh, oh, oh...

72
00:06:35,248 --> 00:06:38,248
Oh, oh, oh...

73
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:42,248
Oh, oh, oh...

74
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:58,048
Bokobokobo, Kobo Kanaeru at your service! Let me be your sun to shine your day!

75
00:06:58,248 --> 00:07:00,248
Ehehe...

またギターで出てきたよね。えへへ。
I came out with a guitar again, huh? Ehehe.

84
00:07:24,248 --> 00:07:26,048
え、ちょっと待って。
Eh, wait a moment.

85
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:28,748
Let me put the guitar down first.

86
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:34,248

(Grunts)

87

"Hei Kobo! Oi! Is your stage different?"
"Hey Kobo! Oi! Is your stage different?"

96
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:12,748
Ah! Chat! Nice... Nice eyes chat! You noticed it!

97

新しいステージや！
It's a new stage!

100
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,748
There's a big Cilus right here.

101
00:08:25,248 --> 00:08:27,748
Cilus... 大きなCilus。
Cilus... big Cilus.

102
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:31,248
うにょ、うにょ、うにょ...
Squish, squish, squish...

And so many stars! Stars!

So many stars!

And then... a big... a big rainbow right here!

106
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:43,748
Big, very big rainbow.

107
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:48,748
And so many clouds because... um... I don't know,

108
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:52,248
I think it's just very aesthetic.

109
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:56,248
And the floor! Floor!

110
00:08:56,248 --> 00:08:57,748
Floor 見てて！
Look at the floor!

111
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:03,248
わぁ... なんか... pattern... うん... 海みたい。
Wow... kinda... pattern... yeah... like the sea.

112
00:09:04,248 --> 00:09:06,748
You know? Yeah like my hair.

113
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:12,748
So, um... Don't forget to take a lot of screenshots, okay?

Are you guys ready for the next performance?

Okay! Let's go to the next performance!

125
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:02,248
Wait, I tried to...

126
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,740
あ、オッケー。
Ah, okay.

127
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,940
入ってます。
It's on.

128
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,140
それでは皆さん、準備いいか？
Well then everyone, are you ready?

129
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,940
Let's go to the next song.

130
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,040
とくべつチューして
Give me a special kiss.

131
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,940
Oh baby I love you じゃ足りない
Oh baby, "I love you" isn't enough.

132
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,140
一番大事がいい
I want to be your number one.

133
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,540
君が作るオリジナルの
With an original style made just by you,

134
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
とくべつチューして
Give me a special kiss.

135
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,440
眩しくて目が覚めて
So bright it wakes me up,

136
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,140
愛しく想ってよ
Think of me lovingly.

137
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,040
眠り姫のように
Like a sleeping beauty,

138
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,940
優しく口づけて
Kiss me gently.

139
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,240
夢見たこの世界
In this world I dreamed of,

140
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,240
魔法がかかる君がいる
There is magic, because you are here.

141
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,740
全てに触れずに
Without touching everything,

142
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,740
二人だけで You & I
Just the two of us, You & I.

143
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,640
私のこと
Make me...

144
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,140
独占して
...yours exclusively.

145
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,140
君だけのものになってもいい
I don't mind becoming yours alone.

146
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,440
なんでもある日の
On a day with everything,

147
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,140
なんでもない
Or on a day with nothing,

148
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,840
気づいてね
Please notice me.

149
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,640
Oh baby I love you じゃ足りない
Oh baby, "I love you" isn't enough.

150
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,640
君の特別にして
Make me your special one.

151
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,540
ねぇもっと Give me a kiss more 私は
Hey, give me a kiss more, I am...

152
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,340
君でいっぱいよ
...full of you.

153
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,040
ほどけないリボン結び
Like a ribbon knot that won't come undone,

800
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,719
大丈夫
I'll be okay.

801
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:18,019
何度言い聞かせればいいの
How many times must I tell myself that?

802
00:46:19,219 --> 00:46:22,019
愛という沼に
In this swamp called love,

803
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:24,919
溺れてる
I am drowning.

804
00:46:24,919 --> 00:46:28,919
私の声は届かない
My voice doesn't reach you.

805
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:33,919
サヨナラの前に
Before we say goodbye,

806
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:35,519
キスをして
kiss me.

807
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,219
サヨナラの後は
After the goodbye,

808
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:41,319
忘れさせて
let me forget.

809
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:46,719
でもあなたの名前が消えない
But your name just won't disappear.

810
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:47,919
離れない
Can't leave,

811
00:46:47,919 --> 00:46:49,019
離せない
can't let go,

812
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:50,419
戻りたい
want to go back.

813
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:54,719
Take me free

814
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:56,119
サヨナラの前に
Before we say goodbye,

815
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:58,119
キスをして
kiss me.

816
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:01,719
サヨナラの後は
After the goodbye,

817
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:03,719
忘れさせて
let me forget.

818
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:09,119
でもあなたの名前が消えない
But your name just won't disappear.

819
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,219
離れない
Can't leave,

820
00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:11,419
離せない
can't let go,

821
00:47:11,419 --> 00:47:12,819
戻れない
can't go back.

822
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:17,419
Take me free

823
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:43,119
closing

824
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:43,919
帰らない日々
Days that won't return,

825
00:47:43,919 --> 00:47:46,419
抱きしめたまま
while still holding them close.

826
00:47:46,419 --> 00:47:48,419
いつかそう
Someday, yes,

827
00:47:48,419 --> 00:47:50,519
いつか
someday.

828
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:53,119
弱い心が
Before my weak heart

829
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,519
捕まる前に
gets captured,

830
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,619
そっとあなたを遠ざけた
I softly pushed you away.

831
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:21,119
ああ こんな気持ち
Ah, this feeling,

832
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,519
辛すぎるよ もう
it's too painful now.

833
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:29,619
あなたは誰なの
Who are you?

834
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:33,319
どこに隠れてたの
Where were you hiding?

835
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:39,619
ひどく怯えてる
Terribly frightened,

836
00:48:40,419 --> 00:48:43,919
うつむいたままの
looking down...

837
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:49,119
惨めな私が
my miserable self

838
00:48:51,419 --> 00:48:53,119
笑ってた
was laughing.

839
00:48:54,619 --> 00:48:57,319
またあの季節
Again, that season comes.

840
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:00,219
夜空は白く
The night sky is white.

841
00:49:00,219 --> 00:49:02,919
あなたもいて
You are there too.

842
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:07,319
触れてこないで
Don't touch me.

843
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,219
嬉しいけど
I'm happy, but...

844
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:13,619
心が痛い
my heart hurts.

845
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,719
離したくない
I don't want to let go.

846
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:20,619
離れたくない
I don't want to be apart.

847
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:24,619
でも諦めてた
But I had given up.

848
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:27,919
もうこれ以上
I can't fall in love

849
00:49:27,919 --> 00:49:29,619
好きになれない
any more than this.

850
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:32,919
失う痛み
The pain of loss,

851
00:49:32,919 --> 00:49:35,519
耐えきれないよ
I can't bear it.

852
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:38,419
帰らない日々
Days that won't return,

853
00:49:38,419 --> 00:49:40,819
抱きしめたまま
while still holding them close.

854
00:49:40,819 --> 00:49:42,919
いつかそう
Someday, yes,

855
00:49:42,919 --> 00:49:44,919
いつか
someday.

856
00:49:44,919 --> 00:49:47,319
ただそばにいて
Just stay by my side,

857
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:49,919
それだけでいい
that's all I need.

858
00:49:49,919 --> 00:49:55,119
素直にはなれないけれど
Though I can't be honest with my feelings.

859
00:50:04,971 --> 00:50:08,471
さぁ 顔を上げて
Come on, raise your face.

860
00:50:08,971 --> 00:50:13,471
歩み始めなきゃ
I gotta start walking.

861
00:50:13,971 --> 00:50:18,471
リアルな私を気づいて
Notice the real me.

862
00:50:22,971 --> 00:50:27,471
またあの季節 この空の下
Again in that season, under this sky...

863
00:50:27,971 --> 00:50:31,471
見上げている
...I am looking up.

864
00:50:32,471 --> 00:50:36,971
傷ついたもの
The things that were hurt...

865
00:50:37,471 --> 00:50:42,971
もう元には 戻らないけれど
...won't return to how they were, but...

866
00:50:44,971 --> 00:50:47,171
離したくない
I don't want to let go.

867
00:50:47,471 --> 00:50:49,771
離れたくない
I don't want to be apart.

868
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:52,971
もう諦めない
I won't give up anymore.

869
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:58,471
あなたの心 傷つけてでも
Even if I hurt your heart...

870
00:50:58,971 --> 00:51:03,971
この気持ちに 嘘はつけない
...I can't lie to this feeling.

871
00:51:04,471 --> 00:51:08,971
いつか笑顔で 話せるような
So that someday we can talk with smiles...

872
00:51:09,471 --> 00:51:12,471
私を見つけて
...find me.

873
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:16,471
枯れそうにいて
As if withering away...

874
00:51:16,971 --> 00:51:20,971
聞かせてほしい 二度と一人にはしないと
...I want you to tell me that you'll never leave me alone again.

875
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:51,471
帰らない日々 抱きしめたまま
Embracing the days that won't return.

876
00:51:51,971 --> 00:51:55,971
きっとそう きっと
Surely, yes, surely.

877
00:51:56,971 --> 00:52:01,971
あの日の気持ち 受け止めないと
I have to accept the feelings of that day...

878
00:52:02,471 --> 00:52:06,471
前に進むことができない
...or I can't move forward.

879
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:08,971
離したくない
I don't want to let go.

880
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:11,471
離れたくない
I don't want to be apart.

881
00:52:11,971 --> 00:52:15,971
一つの願いは
My one wish is...

882
00:52:16,171 --> 00:52:20,471
大好きだよと 伝えたいだけ
...just to tell you "I love you."

883
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:24,471
本当 素直じゃないけれど
Really, I'm not honest though.

884
00:53:35,171 --> 00:53:40,471
So... How is it guys?

885
00:53:40,971 --> 00:53:46,971
That was "Closing"... Do you take a lot of screenshot?
That was "Closing"... Do you take a lot of screenshots?

886
00:53:47,471 --> 00:53:53,971
And ah! How about my new stage? Woah!

887
00:53:54,971 --> 00:53:58,471
It's very cloudy here.

888
00:53:58,971 --> 00:54:07,471
Yeah as you can see, there's two BIG CHEERS on the left and right.

889
00:54:07,971 --> 00:54:11,971
みんな、どうだった？こぼのパフォーマンス。

いっぱいスクリーンショット撮れたかな？

891
00:54:15,171 --> 00:54:19,971
こぼの新しいステージはもうどうだった？かわいいでしょ？
How was Kobo's new stage? Cute, right?

892
00:54:20,471 --> 00:54:25,471
ビッグ・チアーズがありますので、めっちゃかわいいよね。
There are Big Cheers, so it's super cute, isn't it?

893
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:31,971
So actually, yeah, we're already at the end of the show guys, but...

894
00:54:32,471 --> 00:54:36,971
そろそろお別れ時間になりますよ。
It's about time to say goodbye.

895
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:42,471
But don't worry. Kobo still have something to share with you guys.

00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:01,751

00:56:05,951 --> 00:56:11,151
We have this "Jellyfish Princess on the Wall" Tapestry!

923
00:56:13,151 --> 00:56:15,751
It's printed with my brand new birthday illustration.

924
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:20,751
It's super high quality and perfect for decorating your wall.

925
00:56:21,351 --> 00:56:25,651
You can wake up and see Kobo's smug face every morning.

00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:42,051
Two pieces.

931
00:56:43,251 --> 00:56:45,151
One has my birthday outfit.

932
00:56:45,651 --> 00:56:48,851
And the other is an illustration I drew by myself.

933
00:56:51,551 --> 00:56:53,051
Yeah, by myself.

934
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,651
It looks good right?

935
00:56:57,051 --> 00:56:57,951
Do you like it?

936
00:56:58,251 --> 00:56:59,851
I drew it by myself.

937
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:03,351
So you can pin them to your bag...

938
00:57:03,351 --> 00:57:05,251
...or your hat, or your heart.

939
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,051
Okay, so this one...

940
00:57:12,451 --> 00:57:14,251
...is one of my favorites.

941
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:17,351
One, two, three...

It's me!

945
00:57:22,451 --> 00:57:24,151
But mini Kobo in mini form.

946
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,151
You can bring me anywhere...

947
00:57:27,151 --> 00:57:30,151
...on your backpack, your keys...

948
00:57:31,151 --> 00:57:32,651
...your motorcycle...

949
00:57:33,151 --> 00:57:35,551
...the car, whatever.

950
00:57:36,151 --> 00:57:39,251
Even next to your computer while you watch my streams.

951
00:57:40,051 --> 00:57:41,951
So soft and squishy.

952
00:57:45,451 --> 00:57:46,851
And finally!

953
00:57:47,751 --> 00:57:50,351
We also have the Situational Voice.

00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:58,251
So it's called "Your One and Only Jellyfish Princess".

955
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,751
Ohhh what does it mean?

956

957
00:58:03,651 --> 00:58:04,451

So you know what does it mean.
So you know what it means.

959
00:58:06,951 --> 00:58:10,951
It is a special voice pack where I talk to you about Jellyfish Princess...

960
00:58:11,751 --> 00:58:17,351

If you buy a set of them, you'll get a special bromide with my signature on it.

963
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:31,651
The merch is available for a limited time only.

964
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:34,851

00:58:52,951 --> 00:58:56,651
以上、こぼからのお知らせでした。
That's all for the announcement from Kobo.

969
00:58:57,051 --> 00:59:00,351
説明欄やチャット欄にリンクを貼ってありますので...
Links are in the description and chat...

970
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:03,351
...ポチっとしてね！
...so please click them!

971
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:09,551
But! I can hear some of you want an encore.

972
00:59:12,451 --> 00:59:13,351
Encore?

973
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:14,851
アンコール欲しい？
Do you want an encore?

974
00:59:16,051 --> 00:59:17,351
じゃあ、しょうがないなぁ。
Well, I guess I have no choice.

975
00:59:41,251 --> 00:59:42,051
Please listen.

976
00:59:42,451 --> 00:59:43,851
Sweet Memories.

977
01:00:13,231 --> 01:00:15,301
懐かしい
It's a nostalgic...

978
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:18,801
痛みだわ
...pain.

979
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:22,401
ずっと前に
One I had forgotten...

980
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:26,001
忘れていた
...a long time ago.

981
01:00:28,701 --> 01:00:32,801
でもあなたを見たとき
But the moment I saw you,

982
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:38,401
時間だけ
It was as if only time...

983
01:00:38,731 --> 01:00:41,501
後戻りしたの
...had turned backwards.

984
01:00:42,701 --> 01:00:48,001
「幸せ？」と聞かないで
Don't ask me if I'm happy.

985
01:00:49,301 --> 01:00:55,001
嘘つくのは上手じゃない
I'm not very good at lying.

986
01:00:57,601 --> 01:01:01,501
友達ならいるけど
I have friends, sure,

987
01:01:02,661 --> 01:01:06,301
あんなには
But I just can't burn...

988
01:01:06,601 --> 01:01:11,001
燃え上がれなくて
...with passion like that.

989
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:17,501
失った夢だけが
Only the dreams I've lost...

990
01:01:18,201 --> 01:01:23,001
美しく見えるのは
...seem so beautiful now.

991
01:01:23,201 --> 01:01:25,501
何故かしら
I wonder why?

992
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:29,001
過ぎ去った
Even the kindness...

993
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:33,501
優しさも今は
...that has passed is now...

994
01:01:34,501 --> 01:01:37,401
甘い
...just a sweet...

995
01:01:37,661 --> 01:01:40,201
記憶
...memory.

996
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:44,001
Sweet memories

997
01:01:55,301 --> 01:02:00,001
キスしたらいけないわ
We shouldn't kiss.

998
01:02:02,201 --> 01:02:04,401
傷をひとつ
It would only add...

999
01:02:04,661 --> 01:02:09,001
増やすだけよ
...one more scar.

1000
01:02:10,301 --> 01:02:12,501
長い
For such a long...

1001
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:15,501
間あなたに
...time, I missed you...

1002
01:02:16,201 --> 01:02:18,501
会いたくて
...and wanted to see you...

1003
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:23,501
泣いていたくせに
...crying all the while.

1004
01:02:24,501 --> 01:02:27,001
あの頃は
Back then,

1005
01:02:27,301 --> 01:02:30,001
若すぎて
We were too young.

1006
01:02:31,301 --> 01:02:34,001
いたずらに
Needlessly...

1007
01:02:34,301 --> 01:02:38,001
傷つけあったふたり
...we hurt each other.

1008
01:02:38,501 --> 01:02:42,001
色褪せた
Even the faded...

1009
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:46,501
悲しみも今は
...sadness is now...

1010
01:02:47,301 --> 01:02:50,001
遠い
...just a distant...

1011
01:02:50,301 --> 01:02:53,001
記憶
...memory.

1012
01:02:53,301 --> 01:02:56,001
Sweet memories

1013
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:10,001
Woo...

1014
01:03:11,501 --> 01:03:15,001
La la la...

1015
01:03:33,201 --> 01:03:35,001
失った
Only the lost...

1016
01:03:37,301 --> 01:03:39,001
夢だけが
...dreams...

1017
01:03:40,201 --> 01:03:42,501
美しく
...seem so beautiful...

1018
01:03:43,001 --> 01:03:47,001
見えるのは何故かしら
...why is that, I wonder?

1019
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:50,501
過ぎ去った
Even the kindness...

1020
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:54,501
優しさも今は
...that has passed is now...

1021
01:03:55,301 --> 01:03:58,501
甘い
...just a sweet...

1022
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:01,001
記憶
...memory.

1023
01:04:01,301 --> 01:04:05,001
Sweet memories

1024
01:05:00,501 --> 01:05:03,001
君は本当に
You really...

1025
01:05:03,301 --> 01:05:07,001
わかってない
...don't understand.

1026
01:05:10,321 --> 01:05:12,821
エンドより 甘くて豪華な
Sweeter and more luxurious than the end roll,

1027
01:05:12,821 --> 01:05:14,821
デザートより
More than dessert,

1028
01:05:14,821 --> 01:05:17,821
君がいいんだよ
I prefer you.

1029
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:24,821
二つの傘より
Rather than two umbrellas,

1030
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:27,821
相合い傘
sharing one together.

1031
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:30,821
ちょっと冷たいけど
It's a little cold, but...

1032
01:05:31,821 --> 01:05:35,321
愛するための代償なら
If it's the price to pay for love,

1033
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:38,821
いくらでもどうぞ
then take as much as you want.

1034
01:05:38,821 --> 01:05:41,821
ただずっとそばにいたい
I just want to stay by your side forever.

1035
01:05:42,821 --> 01:05:45,421
ねえ 誰を？星屑もんない
Hey, who? Stardust is boring.

1036
01:05:48,821 --> 01:05:54,321
二人ぼっちの世界でずっと
In a world of just us two, forever.

1037
01:05:55,121 --> 01:05:58,121
最後の花火を上げて
Launch the final fireworks,

1038
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,821
フィナーレを飾って
decorate the finale,

1039
01:06:00,821 --> 01:06:05,821
奇跡の降る恋に落ちて
and fall in a love where miracles rain down.

1040
01:06:06,821 --> 01:06:09,821
誰も離さないで
Don't let anyone go.

1041
01:06:10,821 --> 01:06:15,821
味気ない世界も悪くないね
This dull world isn't so bad, is it?

1042
01:06:16,821 --> 01:06:20,821
どんなに恋をしたって
No matter how much I love,

1043
01:06:20,821 --> 01:06:23,821
出会えないよ きっと
I surely won't find another like this.

1044
01:06:23,821 --> 01:06:28,821
終わりのない幸せにキスをしよう
Let's kiss this never-ending happiness.

1045
01:06:39,821 --> 01:06:43,321
いつか今日を忘れても
Even if I forget today someday,

1046
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:48,821
君がいいんだよ
it still has to be you.

1047
01:06:49,821 --> 01:06:54,821
天気雨の日 言い訳として
Using the sun shower as an excuse,

1048
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:57,821
初めて目が合った
our eyes met for the first time.

1049
01:06:57,821 --> 01:07:01,821
ずっと覚えておくよ
I will remember it forever.

1050
01:07:27,321 --> 01:07:29,821
ねえ 誰を？星屑もんない

Launch the final fireworks,

1053
01:07:41,321 --> 01:07:44,321
フィナーレを飾って
decorate the finale,

1054
01:07:44,321 --> 01:07:49,321
奇跡の降る恋に落ちて
and fall in a love where miracles rain down.

1055
01:07:50,321 --> 01:07:53,321
誰も離さないで
Don't let anyone go.

1056
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:59,321
味気ない世界も悪くないね
This dull world isn't so bad, is it?

1057
01:08:00,321 --> 01:08:04,321
どんなに恋をしたって
No matter how much I love,

1058
01:08:04,321 --> 01:08:07,321
忘れられないよ きっと

1061

でもそれがね
But that is,

1062
01:08:41,821 --> 01:08:46,321
二人の幸せ
our happiness together.

1063
01:08:55,821 --> 01:08:57,821
Oh my god, I almost cried.

1064
01:08:58,321 --> 01:09:00,821
I was crying in this song.

1065
01:09:02,821 --> 01:09:04,821
Thank you for today guys.

1066
01:09:05,321 --> 01:09:07,821
Thank you for watching until the end.

1067
01:09:10,321 --> 01:09:14,821
And thank you for Zeta-chan because she covered this Finale song first...

1068
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:17,821

Thank you!

1082
01:10:14,297 --> 01:10:20,297
I can't be as bright as now without you!
