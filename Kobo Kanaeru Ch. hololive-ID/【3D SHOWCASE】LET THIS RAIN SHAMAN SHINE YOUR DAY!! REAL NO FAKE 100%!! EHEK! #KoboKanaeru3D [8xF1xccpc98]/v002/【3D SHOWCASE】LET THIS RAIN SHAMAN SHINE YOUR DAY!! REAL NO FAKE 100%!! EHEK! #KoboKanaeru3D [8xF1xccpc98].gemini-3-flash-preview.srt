6
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,000
いっせーのーせで踏み込むゴーライン 僕らは...
Ready, set, go! Stepping across the finish line...

7
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
...何も 何も まだ知らぬ
...We don't know anything, anything yet.

8
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,400
一線を越えて振り返るともうない 僕らは...
Crossing the line, looking back, it's no longer there...

9
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:40,000
...何も 何も まだ知らぬ
...We don't know anything, anything yet.

10
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
うまって うまって うまってく 煌めく汗がこぼれるのさ
Sweat is pouring, pouring, pouring down, sparkling as it falls.

11
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,500
覚えてないこともたくさんあっただろう
There must have been many things we didn't remember.

12
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,600
誰も 彼も シルエット
Everyone, every one of them is a silhouette.

13
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,300
大事にしてたもの 忘れたふりをしたんだよ
We pretended to forget the things we held dear.

14
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:13,000
何も ないよ 笑えるさ
There's nothing left, we can just laugh.

15
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,800
いっせーので思い出す少年 僕らは...
Ready, set, go! Remembering the boy we were...

16
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:24,000
...何もかもを欲しがった
...We wanted everything.

17
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,100
わかってるって あきづいてるって 時計の...
I know, I've realized, the clock's...

18
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:35,300
...針は 日々は 止まらない
...hands, the days won't stop.

19
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:45,300
うまって うまって うまってく 流れる時を時々 遠くにあって
Drowning, drowning, drowning, the flowing time is sometimes far away.

20
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,600
覚えてないこともたくさんあっただろう
There must have been many things we didn't remember.

21
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,700
誰も 彼も シルエット
Everyone, every one of them is a silhouette.

22
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,000
恐れて回ること 知らぬふりをしてるのさ
We're pretending not to know about turning in fear.

23
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:01,348
...いたよ
...wanted to be.

24
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:04,248
何もないよと笑い合えたさ
We were able to laugh together, saying "It's nothing."

25
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:21,048
ひらりとひらりと舞ってる
Fluttering, fluttering, they're dancing.

26
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:29,548
木の葉の様に揺れること無く過ごしていたいよ
I want to spend my days without swaying like leaves.

27
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:35,848
覚えてないこともたくさんあったけど
There were many things I don't remember, but...

28
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:44,248
きっとずっと変わらないものがあることを
That there are things that will surely never change...

29
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:48,548
教えてくれたあなたは
You, who taught me that, are...

30
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,548
消える消えるシルエット
A fading, fading silhouette.

31
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:56,048
大事にしたいもの持って大人になるんだ
I'll become an adult while holding onto the things I cherish.

32
00:05:56,048 --> 00:06:00,048
どんな時も離さずに
Never letting go, no matter when.

33
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:03,548
守り続けよう
Let's keep on protecting them.

34
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:06,548
そしたらいつの日にか
Then, someday...

35
00:06:06,548 --> 00:06:12,048
なにもかもを笑えるさ
We'll be able to laugh at everything.

36
00:06:12,048 --> 00:06:17,048
ひらりとひらりと舞ってる
Fluttering, fluttering, they're dancing.

37
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:21,048
木の葉が飛んでゆく
The leaves are flying away.

38
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:03,048

55
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:50,048
Hanya sebuah gubuk kecil doang.
It's just a small shack.

56
00:07:50,248 --> 00:07:52,548
Di situ ada perahu ya, di situ ada perahu...
There's a boat there, there's a boat...

57
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:56,048
soalnya Kobo biasa pindah-pindah pulau ya.
because Kobo usually moves from island to island.

58
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:59,848
Karena mercusuar Kobo tuh banyak, nggak cuma di pulau ini doang.
Because Kobo has many lighthouses, not just on this island.

59
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:01,548
Nih lihat ya tuh.
Look at that.

60
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:04,548

See! Wii, it's really tall though.

61
00:08:05,548 --> 00:08:09,548
Ya tadi kalian di awal udah lihat ya, cuma emang apa ya...
You saw it at the beginning, but... it's just...

62
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:13,048
tinggi banget jadi rada capek ke sana.
really tall so it's a bit tiring to go there.

63
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:15,548
Jadi nanti aja ya Kobo tunjukin ke kalian ya.
So Kobo will show it to you later, okay?

Dag dig dug...
Thump-thump-thump...

96
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:02,003

100
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:19,503
Seorang biasa saja...
Just an ordinary person...

101
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:23,303
...apa pantas tuk bersanding denganmu.
...is it fitting to be by your side.

102
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:26,603
Overthinking, tapi gamau ambil pusing.
Overthinking, but I don't want to worry.

103
00:10:27,603 --> 00:10:32,503
Karna aku bukan kaum mendang-mending.
Because I'm not the type to compare.

Oh asmara...
Oh romance...

130
00:12:02,203 --> 00:12:07,103
Tidak adakah ruang dalam hatimu...
Is there no room in your heart...

131
00:12:07,903 --> 00:12:11,403

Strangely enough, you were the first...

Berdebar rasanya...
It feels like my heart is racing...

143
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,603
Ku di dekatmu.
When I'm near you.

144
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:55,503
Oh asmara...
Oh romance...

145
00:12:55,703 --> 00:12:58,803
Dengar bisikan cinta lirik matamu.
Listen to the whispers of love from your eyes.

146
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:03,503
Oh asmara...

00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:11,203

00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:21,003
Karena kini ku t'lah menjadi...
Because now I have become...

151
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:22,903
Menjadi apa?
Become what?

152
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:26,203
Milikmu!
Yours!

153
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:32,503

155
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:50,103
Selamat 3D!
Congratulations on your 3D!

156
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:55,303
Eh bentar itu, itu kenapa ada...
Wait a second, why is there...

157
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:56,903
Kenapa ada papan kardus?
Why is there a cardboard board?

158
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,403
Ini lagi ngapain nih?
What's going on here?

159
00:13:58,603 --> 00:13:59,903
Ini kenalin...
Let me introduce you to...

160
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:01,603
Pacar baru!
My new boyfriend!

161
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:03,303
Ya ampun...!
Oh my goodness...!

162
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:04,603
Namanya siapa ini?
What's his name?

163
00:14:06,103 --> 00:14:09,603
Siapa ya? Gak sih, gak tau, tapi ganteng kan?
Who is it? I don't know, but he's handsome, right?

164
00:14:09,603 --> 00:14:10,903
Iya, lumayan banget.
Yeah, he's quite something.

165
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:11,703
Diam.
Be quiet.

166
00:14:11,803 --> 00:14:14,903
Mohon maaf nih, mohon maaf nih Aboy ya, bukannya gimana-gimana nih...
Sorry about this, sorry Aboy, it's not like that...

167
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:17,803
Tapi biasa nih cowok yang kayak gini nih...
But usually guys like this...

168
00:14:17,903 --> 00:14:20,403
Halo, cowok yang kayak gini biasanya ada maunya.
Hello, guys like this usually want something.

169
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:21,503
Apa tuh maunya?
What do they want?

170
00:14:21,503 --> 00:14:23,203
Gak gak, jangan dengerin dia.
No, no, don't listen to her.

171
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:24,503
Ayang, jangan dengerin dia.
Honey, don't listen to her.

172
00:14:24,503 --> 00:14:25,603
Ya gitu sih.
Yeah, that's how it is.

173
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:27,603
Gak, gak mungkin gak mungkin.
No, no way, it's impossible.

174
00:14:27,703 --> 00:14:28,303
Ayang!
Honey!

175
00:14:28,503 --> 00:14:30,903
Ayang kamu dengerin aku gak sih?
Honey, are you listening to me?

176
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:31,803
Na- Ayang!
Na- Honey!

177
00:14:45,103 --> 00:14:46,503
Itu...
That...

178
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:48,903
Mending dengerin aku, mending dengerin aku dulu nih.
Better listen to me, better listen to me first.

179
00:14:48,903 --> 00:14:50,103
Gak bisa kayak gini, Ela.
It can't be like this, Ela.

180
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:51,403
Makanya...
That's why...

181
00:14:51,403 --> 00:14:53,403
Mendingan kamu tuh...
It's better if you...

182
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:54,703
...jadi gepeng.
...become 2D.

183
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:56,103
Biar sama nih.
So you're the same.

184
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:58,403
Susah-susah nunggu debut 3D...
After waiting so hard for the 3D debut...

185
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:00,103
...masa jadi gepeng?
...you want me to be 2D?

186
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:00,984
MAGIIII!

187
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:02,884
Udah, udah, udah. Nggak usah ribut.
Enough, enough. No need to make a fuss.

188
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:05,184
Masa kardus ginian doang diributin.
Are you really making a fuss over just a cardboard cutout?

189
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:06,584
Ini bukan kardus ya!
This is not cardboard!

190
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:15,584
[Suara menangis]
[Crying sounds]

191
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:17,084
Eh, eh, mohon maaf nih.
Hey, hey, sorry about this.

192
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,584
Demi kebaikan kamu, mendingan kamu fokus 3D dulu.
For your own good, you'd better focus on your 3D showcase first.

193
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:20,584
Emang boleh?
Is that allowed?

194
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:22,084
Ini kubawa dulu ya.
I'll take this for now.

195
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:23,584
Balikin!
Give it back!

196
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:26,584
Semangat 3D!
Good luck with your 3D!

197
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:32,084
Tidak, jangan pacar aku... Magni manis...

君の心に包まれたまま 愛を誓い
Wrapped in your heart, I swear my love

200
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:10,084
眠れない夜何度過ぎてもね 受け止めて
No matter how many sleepless nights pass, accept me

201
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:15,384
今すぐ会いたい 涙止まらない 触れたくて
I want to see you right now, tears won't stop, I want to touch you

202
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:21,084
好きだから 苦しくて
Because I love you, it's painful

203
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:26,084
君のことを想うほど
The more I think of you

204
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:31,084
この涙こぼれるの
These tears overflow

205
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:36,084
このまま会えないとしても
Even if we can't meet like this

206
00:16:36,084 --> 00:16:41,084
誰より 好きだから
Because I love you more than anyone

207
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:50,084
バイバイさっきしたばかりなのに
Even though we just said goodbye

208
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:55,184
会いたいが また溢れるの
The desire to see you overflows again

209
00:16:55,184 --> 00:17:00,284
消えてしまいそうなあの日のワンキス
That one kiss that day that seems like it might vanish

210
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:05,184
君からのメールを待つの
I wait for a message from you

211
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:07,784
君と会えば狭まるタイムリミット
The time limit narrows when I meet you

212
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:10,184
二人の時間 大事に
Cherishing our time together

213
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:12,784
バイバイしてもまた会いたい
Even if we say goodbye, I want to see you again

214
00:17:12,784 --> 00:17:15,084
君とのメールでまた再会
Reuniting again through your messages

215
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:17,384
変わる景色 街はトワイライト
The scenery changes, the city is in twilight

216
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:19,584
いそのこと君を奪い去りたい
I'd rather just snatch you away

217
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:22,084
君の温もりが消える頃
By the time your warmth fades away

218
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,584
夢から覚めれば現実のドア
If I wake from the dream, it's the door of reality

219
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:29,584
君のことを想うほど
The more I think of you

220
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:34,584
この涙こぼれるの
These tears overflow

221
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:39,584
このまま会えないとしても
Even if we can't meet like this

222
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:44,284
誰より 好きだから
Because I love you more than anyone

223
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:49,284
I love you... Love you... I love you... Love you...

224
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:51,584
I love you... Love you...

225
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:54,084
夜が明ければ 探す君だけを
If the night dawns, I'll search only for you

226
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:58,784
I love you... Love you... I love you... Love you...

227
00:17:58,784 --> 00:18:01,284

目を閉じれば My love for you
If I close my eyes, my love for you

229
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,584
あなたと...
With you...

230

今すぐ会いたい 限りあるタイム
I want to see you right now, limited time

231
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:13,584
永遠の愛 信じてはみたい
I want to believe in eternal love

232
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:16,084
離れること考えると胸が真っ二つに
The thought of being apart splits my heart in two

233
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:18,584
避けるようにタイト
Tight as if to avoid it

234
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:21,084
可愛げなフェイス よければ抱いて
A cute face, hold me if you'd like

235
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:23,584
引き裂かれるカウントダウンのようにブレイク
Break like a countdown being torn apart

236
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:26,084
Love baby, love baby 言葉をフリーズ
Love baby, love baby, freeze the words

237
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:28,084
ショーが始まった また次のシーン
The show has started, on to the next scene

238
00:18:28,084 --> 00:18:30,284
想えば想うほど 降り積もる思い
The more I think of you, the more my feelings pile up

239
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:32,584
会えば会うほど...
The more we meet...

240
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:37,584
そばにいたいと 強く願うほど 明日さえ見えなくて
The more I strongly wish to be by your side, I can't even see tomorrow

241
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,584
いつか見つけるまで 離したくはない
Until I find you someday, I don't want to let go

242
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:42,584
離れたくはない
I don't want to be apart

243
00:18:42,584 --> 00:18:44,584
Love you baby, love you

244
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:47,584
君は離さない
I won't let you go

245
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:52,584
君のことを想うほど
The more I think of you

246
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:57,584
この涙こぼれるの
These tears overflow

247
00:18:57,584 --> 00:19:02,584
明けない夜の中 一人 君しか見えなくて
In the never-ending night, alone, I can see only you

248
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:12,584
君の心に包まれたまま 愛を誓い
Wrapped in your heart, I swear my love

251
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:27,584
好きだから 苦しくて
Because I love you, it's painful

252
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:32,584
I love you... Love you... I love you... Love you...

253
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:37,084

256
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,584
I love you... Love you...

257

目を閉じれば My love for you
If I close my eyes, my love for you

258
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:54,084
あなたと...
With you...

259
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:15,139
Ah, so fun. Son...

260
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:18,539
Son? What's going on? Why are you crying?

261
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:22,139
Why are you so sad? We just sang a great song together. Come on.

262
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,839
心は痛い...
My heart hurts...

263
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,639
Your heart hurts? But why?

264
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:29,139
My boyfriend cheated on me.

265
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:31,139
He goes for Zeta.

266
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:33,839
Wait, hold on a moment. You have a boyfriend?

267
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,839
Tell me who he is, tell me where he is, and I will take care of everything.

268
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,139
Dad will take care of everything for you, Kobo.

269
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:44,939
I don't know, I don't know his name, but I love him!

270
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:46,639
Um... what?

271
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:48,939
I don't really think I understand, but it's okay.

272
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:54,539
It's okay, son. Look, sometimes things in life just don't go your way.

273
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,939
But it's alright. You'll be okay. I promise.

274
00:20:56,939 --> 00:21:00,139
No! No, no!

275
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:02,939
I can't take this anymore!

276
00:21:02,939 --> 00:21:05,239
Kids, man...

277
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:07,139
Here, just shoot me!

278
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:09,239
A gun? Kobo, I can't do that.

279
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:10,939
Just shoot me!

280
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:13,539
I can't do that. You're my son!

281
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:16,339
Tembak! Tembak! Aku gak tahan!
Shoot! Shoot! I can't take it!

282
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:18,939
Alright, alright. Well, it is my job after all, so I guess I'll do it.

283
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:22,439
If you insist, Kobo. Pick a place where you want to perish.

284
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:25,639
I think I will... maybe here.

285
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:27,639
Alright. Stand really still. Say your prayers.

286
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:30,939
I'm ready! Just shoot me! Shoot me, Dad!

287
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:32,539
Rest in peace.

288
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:40,139
Just doing my job.

289
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:45,639
What happened here? Calli, what did you do? Calli!

290
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:50,139
I... I didn't do anything. Alright, look. I know what it looks like.

291
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:54,139
Look, I shot her with a water gun. Alright?

292
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:57,139
With a water gun. Look, it's not lethal or anything.

293
00:21:57,139 --> 00:21:58,639
But she's dead!

294
00:21:58,639 --> 00:22:02,139
I'm calling... You should be teaching her... she's playing dangerous stuff like this!

295
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:04,639
You know kids, Kiara. Look, she's faking it.

296
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:07,339
She's faking?

297
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:11,939
Did we fail as parents, I wonder?

298
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:14,639
Come on, live!

299
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:30,639
Oh my god! Yes! Come back to me! Come on!

Yes, yes, yes?

302
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:37,639
Sorry, mommy. - Eh? It's okay, it's okay.

303
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:41,639
Oh Kobo, it took you long enough. Come on.

304
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:46,139
Get up before daddy gets in trouble. - Oh my god.

305
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:50,139
I'm back with the water!

306
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:53,239
Thank god. What happened, Kobo? What happened?

307
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,839
My boyfriend cheated on me.

308
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:58,339
Who's your boyfriend? Where is he?

309
00:22:58,339 --> 00:22:59,339
That's what I said!

310
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:02,339
I don't know his name, but I love him!

311
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,639
Listen here you little shit. Forget about him.

312
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:08,939
Mommy is here. Let's just have fun together, okay?

313
00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:11,439
Let's go! - Let's go!

314
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:17,139
Yeah, let's go! Sounds like fun! I'm coming too, right?

315
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:20,139
No! You go buy milk. - Really? Milk?

316
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:24,639
For breakfast. - Milk? Again? We need it?

317
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:26,639
Yeah! Bye-bye!

318
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:29,439
Okay, Kobo. Come on, let's do something fun, okay?

Biar aku gak di-PHP cowok lagi.
So I won't be ghosted by guys anymore.

325
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,439
No! You're still a baby. Let me be the president instead.

先生！行くぜ！
Teacher! Let's go!

348
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,120
いや、もう効果が強引でさって 世を説くこちらには

Casually brushing it off,

Oh, I'm happy to hear that.

378
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,120
But you know, Mommy has to go home now and rest.

379
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,620
But I will sleep and dream about you!

380
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120

Bye-bye!

385
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,620
Okay, she's done now.

386
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,620
So Mommy doesn't know that I'm not going home yet, okay?

387
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,620
I still wanna show you guys something.

388
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,620
Aku mau nunjukin sesuatu yang keren banget.
I want to show you something really cool.

Parah kece parah.
It's super, super cool.

390
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:44,120
A trick using my rain shaman power!

391
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,620
Look at this!

392
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,120

Arigatou!
Thank you!

403
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:46,620
By the way, every time you send a Super Chat, it will give more power to the rain!

404
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,120
Jadi setiap kalian kirim Super Chat, atau eh maksudnya bahasa sopannya apa ya?
So every time you send a Super Chat, or... what's the polite way to say it?

405
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:57,120
Every time you send your "love", it will increase the power...

406
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,120
...kayak amplifier gitu ya.
...like an amplifier.

407
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Ya gitulah, kalian ngertilah.
Well, you guys understand.

408
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,620
Cuman kekuatan seorang Kobo Kanaeru doang yang bisa ngebuat hujan kayak gini cuy!
Only the power of Kobo Kanaeru can make rain like this, guys!

409
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:13,120

Okay, thank you!

426
00:30:27,675 --> 00:30:30,175
My back hurts...

427
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,675
Akhirnya pulang juga ke rumah.
Finally back home.

428
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:40,575
Ah, untung pakai jas hujan.
Ah, luckily I'm wearing a raincoat.

429
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:44,375
Luckily, my outfit is waterproof.

430
00:30:45,475 --> 00:30:47,675
Oh, by the way, welcome!

431
00:30:47,775 --> 00:30:51,775
Welcome to my lighthouse! ようこそ!
Welcome to my lighthouse! Welcome!

432
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:54,775
Ini dalamnya mercusuar aku. Ih, ih!
This is the inside of my lighthouse. Hehe!

433
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:59,775
Aku room tour dikit kali ya? Oke, let's go do a quick room tour, okay?
Should I do a quick room tour? Okay, let's do a quick room tour, okay?

434
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:04,775
Jadi di sini ada tangga karena mercusuar aku tuh tinggi banget sebenarnya.
So here's a staircase because my lighthouse is actually really tall.

435
00:31:05,275 --> 00:31:08,675
Cuman ya, ya udahlah ya di lantai ini aja.
But well, let's just stay on this floor for now.

436
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:12,675
Nanti kita ke atas nanti-nanti aja, oke? Oke.
We'll go upstairs later, okay? Okay.

437
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:17,175
Lalu biasanya habis pulang sekolah aku langsung tidur. Langsung turu.
And then usually after coming home from school I immediately sleep. Straight to sleep.

438
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:21,575
Tapi ya karena aku buat tamu di sini jadi ya udah.
But since I have guests here, I'll just...

439
00:31:21,675 --> 00:31:25,675
Aku room tour aja deh. Ya kan ya? Ya kan?
...do a room tour instead. Right? Right?

00:31:27,275 --> 00:31:30,175
Oh, ini namanya Oyamatadase.

442
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:37,575
Oke, lanjut. Ee di sini biasa tempat lutingan-lutingan...
Okay, moving on. This is usually where I loot...

443
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:39,975
...makanan-makanan diambil.
...where the food is taken.

444
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:44,375
Terus ini kalau mau nyantai ya sama teman-teman yang biasa saya luting.
And this is where I relax with the friends I usually loot.

445
00:31:45,475 --> 00:31:48,175
Nah, ada apa lagi ya? Ada boneka-boneka. Ini banyak boneka, sorry.
Well, what else is there? Plushies. There are many plushies here, sorry.

In the season of light pink

歌に形はないけれど
Uta ni Katachi wa Nai Keredo

Lyrics・Composition：doriko

486
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:39,775
彩る花びら
Petals coloring everything

487
00:34:40,575 --> 00:34:46,575
ひらひら舞う光の中
In the fluttering light

488
00:34:46,575 --> 00:34:51,675
僕は笑えたはず
I should have been able to smile

489
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:57,175
鮮やかな日々に
In those vivid days

490
00:35:00,156 --> 00:39:05,156
歌に形はないけれど
Though Songs Have No Form

491
00:35:03,356 --> 00:35:07,556
砂の白波　波に溶けて
White crests of sand dissolve into the waves

492
00:35:07,556 --> 00:35:12,956
きっと夢が終わる
Surely the dream will end

493
00:35:13,756 --> 00:35:17,956
真っ白な世界で　目を覚ませば
If I wake up in a pure white world

494
00:35:18,156 --> 00:35:23,356
伸ばす手は何にも　掴めない
My reaching hand can't grasp anything

495
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:29,356
見上げた空が　近くなるほどに
The closer the sky I look up at gets

496
00:35:29,456 --> 00:35:34,656
僕は何を失った？
What did I lose?

497
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:41,956
透き通る波に　映る僕らの影は
Our shadows reflected in the clear waves

498
00:35:41,956 --> 00:35:47,456
青く遠く
Are blue and distant

499
00:35:47,456 --> 00:35:53,256
あの日僕は世界を知り
That day I came to know the world

500
00:35:53,456 --> 00:35:58,856
それは光となった
And it became light

501
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:04,256
僕は歌うよ　笑顔をくれた君が
I'll sing. You who gave me a smile

502
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:09,656
泣いてるとき　ほんの少しだけでもいい
When you're crying, even if just for a little bit

503
00:36:09,756 --> 00:36:15,656
君の支えになりたい
I want to be your support

504
00:36:16,156 --> 00:36:21,256
僕が泣いてしまった日に
Just as you were for me

505
00:36:21,256 --> 00:36:26,656
君がそうだったように
On the day I cried

506
00:36:42,656 --> 00:36:47,656
僕がここに　忘れたものを
The things I forgot here

507
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:53,356
全て君がくれた宝物
Are all treasures you gave me

508
00:36:53,556 --> 00:36:58,756
形のないものだけが
Only things without form

509
00:36:58,956 --> 00:37:04,756
時の中で色褪せないまま
Remain unfaded throughout time

510
00:37:08,856 --> 00:37:14,356
透き通る波　何度消えてしまっても
No matter how many times the clear waves disappear

511
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:20,656
砂の白波　僕は君と残すだろう
I'll surely leave behind white crests of sand with you

512
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:26,856
そこに光を集め
Gathering light there

513
00:37:27,156 --> 00:37:32,256
僕は歌うよ　笑顔をくれた君が
I'll sing. You who gave me a smile

514
00:37:32,456 --> 00:37:37,556
泣いてるとき
When you're crying

515
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:42,756
頼りのない僕だけれど
Even though I'm unreliable

516
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:48,456
君のこと守りたい
I want to protect you

517
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:03,756
遠く離れた君のもとへ
To you who are far away

518
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:09,456
この光が　空を越えて羽ばたいていく
This light will fly across the sky

519
00:38:09,656 --> 00:38:15,256
そんな歌を届けたい
I want to deliver such a song

520
00:38:15,556 --> 00:38:20,756
僕が贈るものは全て
Everything I give you

521
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:26,656
形のないものだけど
Are things without form, but

522
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:32,756
君の心の片隅で
In a corner of your heart

523
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:38,956
輝く星になりたい
I want to be a shining star

524
00:39:06,156 --> 00:39:09,156
Ah, sedikit nggak apa-apa lah ya.
Ah, it's okay if it was a little off, right?

525
00:39:10,656 --> 00:39:14,356
Hahaha! Sedikit salah, sorry, sorry!
Hahaha! A little mistake, sorry, sorry!

526
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:17,156
I made some mistakes...

527
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:19,556
...because I'm so nervous.

528
00:39:19,756 --> 00:39:23,556
This is my first time in 3D live singing with acoustic guitar.

529
00:39:23,756 --> 00:39:27,956
The pressure is different from the usual karaoke.

530
00:39:28,156 --> 00:39:30,256
You know, you know?

531
00:39:30,456 --> 00:39:32,556
Sorry, sorry. Grogi!
Sorry, sorry. I'm nervous!

532
00:39:32,756 --> 00:39:34,056
Ya gitu lah.
Well, that's how it is.

533
00:39:34,256 --> 00:39:37,156
Ya udah lah, nggak usah galau-galau lagi lah. Yuk.
Alright, no need to be gloomy anymore. Let's go.

534
00:39:37,356 --> 00:39:39,556
Entar ya, aku taruh ini dulu.
Wait a sec, I'll put this away first.

535
00:39:39,756 --> 00:39:42,656
Entar ya, aku taruh kursi dulu bentar.
Wait a sec, I'll put the chair away first.

536
00:39:46,656 --> 00:39:50,156
Entar, sambil pakai jaket dulu, ちょっと待ってね。
Wait, putting on my jacket too, wait a moment.

00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:02,211
Oke, oke, oke, oke.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:13,011
Tapi masih ada satu...
But there's still one more...

Oke, sebentar-sebentar, aku punya sesuatu harus dipakai.
Okay, wait a second, I have something I need to wear.

Now I'm ready.

00:40:58,011 --> 00:41:01,011
Let's go to the sky!

Ah, agak takut mainnya.
Ah, I'm a bit scared being here.

Kameramennya terbang, guys, keren banget,
The cameraman is flying, guys, it's so cool,

564
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:36,211
padahal platformnya kecil banget.
even though the platform is so small.

565
00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:40,211
Ya udah, kita harus nyebrang dulu ke sana ya.
Alright, we have to cross over there first.

566
00:41:40,711 --> 00:41:43,711
Ya nanti kalian tahu lah mau ngapain lah.
Well, you'll find out what we're going to do later.

Cuman ini...
But this...

568
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:50,211
Aku nggak tahu pelanginya bisa diinjek apa nggak ya, kayak aku takut tembus.
I don't know if the rainbow can be stepped on or not, like I'm afraid of falling through.

569
00:41:50,711 --> 00:41:53,211
Jatuh kan nggak lucu ya guys, jadi kita lompat aja, oke?
Falling wouldn't be funny, guys, so let's just jump, okay?

00:42:49,211 --> 00:42:51,711
Terus ada awannya lagi mendung ya, lagi hujan tapi ya...
And the clouds are cloudy, it's raining but well...

586
00:42:52,711 --> 00:42:55,011
Nanti bisa berubah lagi ya, kan aku pawang hujan ya.
It'll change later, I'm a rain shaman after all.

587
00:42:55,111 --> 00:42:56,711
Gampang lah ya masalah ini cuaca.
Weather issues are easy.

00:43:04,211 --> 00:43:06,211
Nggak tahu tuh burung siapa lepas.

840
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:22,783
Rapalkan mantra kilau cahaya sinari dunia
Chant the spell, a gleaming light to illuminate the world

841
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:27,783
Sunyi meresapi di ruang hampa
Loneliness seeped into the vacuum

842
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:32,783
Masalah datang dan pergi sudah biasa
Problems come and go, it's just normal

843
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:35,283
Ha... sendiri lagi
Ha... alone again

844
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:38,583
Enggan untuk melangkah
Reluctant to take a step

845
01:00:39,283 --> 01:00:42,783
Kubuka mata menatap langit
I open my eyes, looking at the sky

846
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:46,783
Rintik hujan bergeming genangi bentala
Raindrops remain still, flooding the earth

847
01:00:47,083 --> 01:00:51,783
Ha... seakan membisik "Ayo jelajahi dunia"
Ha... as if whispering "Come on, explore the world"

848
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:56,783
Melamun ke berbagai angan
Daydreaming about various fantasies

849
01:00:57,083 --> 01:01:00,783
Tak akan selesaikan masalah
Won't solve the problems

850
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:04,783
Beranikan diri untuk melangkah
Brace yourself to take a step

851
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:06,583
Terobos...
Break through...

852
01:01:07,783 --> 01:01:11,783
Segala rintangannya
All the obstacles

853
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:16,283
Walau hujan tak kunjung berhenti
Even though the rain never stops

Susah tidurku semalaman
Couldn't sleep all night

868
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:14,783
Degup hati sampai meriang
My heart's thumping until I'm feverish

869

Tak sabar tuk bersenang-senang
Can't wait to have fun

Di panggung megah bersama kalian
On this grand stage with all of you

Kulukis indahnya senyuman
I paint a beautiful smile

875

Melamun ke berbagai angan
Daydreaming about various fantasies
