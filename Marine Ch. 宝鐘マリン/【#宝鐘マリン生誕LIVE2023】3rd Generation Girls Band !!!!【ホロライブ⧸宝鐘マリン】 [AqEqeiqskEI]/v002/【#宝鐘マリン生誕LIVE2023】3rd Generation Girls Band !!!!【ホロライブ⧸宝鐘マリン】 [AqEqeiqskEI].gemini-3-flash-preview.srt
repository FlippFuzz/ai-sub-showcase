ごめんね何もできなくて
I'm sorry I can't do anything

124
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:25,837
痛みを分かち合うことさえ
Even sharing the pain...

125
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:32,499
あなたは許してくれない
...you won't allow me to

126
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:38,899
無垢に生きるため振り向かず
To live in innocence, without looking back...

127
00:13:39,274 --> 00:13:45,409
背中向けて去ってしまう On the lonely rail
...you turn your back and leave, on the lonely rail

128
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:51,651
私ついていくよ どんな辛い世界の闇の中でもさえ
I will follow you, even in the darkness of a harsh world

129
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:58,016
きっとあなたは輝いて
I'm sure you will shine

超える未来の果て 弱さゆえに魂こわされるように
Beyond the end of the future, as if my soul is being broken by my weakness

二人に God bless...
God bless the two of us...

133
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:45,585
届けて熱くなる思いは
Deliver it, these burning feelings

134
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:52,274
現実溶かして彷徨う
Wandering while melting reality

135
00:14:52,627 --> 00:14:58,651
会いたい気持ちに理由はない
There's no reason for wanting to see you

136
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:04,224
あふれだす想いも
Even these overflowing feelings

137
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:11,324
すべてを 美しき夢だけを
Everything, only the beautiful dream

138
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:17,324
描きながら 追いかけよう for your lonely heart
As I draw it, let's chase it for your lonely heart

139
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:21,024
やめて 嘘はあなたらしくないよ
Stop it, lies aren't like you

140
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:24,524
目を見て これからのことを話そう
Look into my eyes, let's talk about the future

141
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:29,524
私 覚悟してる
I'm prepared

142
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:34,024
暗い未来だって 強くなって
Even if it's a dark future, I'll become stronger

143
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:37,824
運命変えられるかもね my wish
Maybe I can change destiny, my wish

144
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:43,024
かなえたいのに 全ては...
I want it to come true, but everything is...

145
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:49,824
あなたがいて
Because you are here

146
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:53,024
私がいて
Because I am here

147
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:58,524
他の人は 消えてしまった
Everyone else has disappeared

148
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:03,024
淡い夢の 美しさを
The beauty of a faint dream

149
00:16:03,024 --> 00:16:07,524
描きながら
As I draw it

150
00:16:07,524 --> 00:16:12,724
傷跡 なぞる
I trace the scars

151
00:16:13,224 --> 00:16:16,824
だから 私 付いていくよ
So, I will follow you

152
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:21,024
どんな辛い 世界の闇の中でも
No matter how painful it is in the darkness of the world

153
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:27,524
きっと あなたは輝いて
Surely, you will shine

154
00:16:28,024 --> 00:16:31,524
超える未来の果て
Beyond the end of the future

155
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:35,324
弱さゆえに 魂こわされるように
As if my soul is being broken due to weakness

156
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:38,524
my way 重なるよ
My ways overlap

157
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:44,224
いま 二人に God bless...
Now, for the two of us, God bless...

158
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,524
文化祭終わったねー！
The culture festival is over!

159
00:17:31,024 --> 00:17:34,524
終わったー！最高だったー！
It's over! It was the best!

160
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:40,524
ねぇみんな、あのさ、今度はさ、もう学校なんて狭い箱は飛び出さない？
Hey everyone, listen, next time, why don't we jump out of this small box called school?

161
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:42,524
おっ？どうしたの？どこ行っちゃうの？
Oh? What's up? Where are we going?

162
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:47,024
路上に行こう、路上に！
Let's go to the streets, the streets!

163
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:51,524
じゃあみんな、次は私服で集合ね！
Then everyone, let's meet in our casual clothes next!

164
00:17:51,524 --> 00:17:55,524
またねー！バイバーイ！
See you! Bye-bye!

165
00:17:53,524 --> 00:17:55,524
準備しとくペコら！パイセン！
I'll get ready-peko! Senpai!

166
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:10,524
あーお待たせー！
Ah, sorry for the wait!

167
00:18:08,524 --> 00:18:10,524
お疲れー！
Good job!

168
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,524
今日、頑張ろう！
Let's do our best today!

169
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,524
頑張ろうー！
Let's do our best!

170
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:19,524
こいつ、私服がこれってマジか？
Is she serious that this is her casual clothes?

171
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:30,224
大丈夫？痛くない？やる？やる？やる？
Are you okay? Does it hurt? Shall we do it? Shall we? Shall we?

172
00:18:30,224 --> 00:18:34,024
やるやる！やろっか！
Let's do it! Let's do it!

173
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:39,024
頑張ろうね！
Let's do our best!

174
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:39,024
頑張ろうー！
Let's do our best!

175

Pretender
作詞・作曲：藤原 聡
Pretender
Lyrics/Composition: Satoshi Fujihara

176
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:24,024
君とのラブストーリー それは予想通り
The love story with you, it's just as expected

177
00:19:24,024 --> 00:19:29,024
いざ始まれば ひとり芝居だ
Once it starts, it's a one-man show

178
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:34,524
ずっとそばにいたって 結局ただの観客だ
Even if I'm always by your side, in the end, I'm just a spectator

179
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:39,824
感情のないアイム・ソーリー それはいつも通り
A soulless "I'm sorry", it's just like usual

180
00:19:39,824 --> 00:19:44,824
慣れてしまえば 悪くはないけど
If I get used to it, it's not so bad, but...

181
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:50,024
君とのロマンスは人生柄 続きはしないことを
The romance with you, given my life, I knew it wouldn't continue...

182
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:54,024
知った
...I knew that

183
00:19:55,424 --> 00:19:57,824
もっと違う設定で
With a different setting

184
00:19:57,824 --> 00:19:59,524
もっと違う関係で
With a different relationship

185
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,132
...で 出会える世界線
...in a worldline where we meet.

186
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:05,132
選べたらよかった もっと違う性格で
I wish I could've chosen it, with a different personality.

187
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:08,532
もっと違う価値観で
With a different set of values.

188
00:20:08,532 --> 00:20:12,732
愛を伝えられたらいいな
I wish I could've expressed my love.

189
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:15,532
そう願っても無駄だから
But even if I wish for that, it's futile.

190
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:25,832
Goodbye 君の運命の人は僕じゃない
Goodbye, the one destined for you isn't me.

191
00:20:25,832 --> 00:20:32,332
辛いけど否めない でも離れ難いのさ
It's painful but undeniable, yet it's hard to let go.

192
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:38,832
その髪に触れただけで 痛いや いやいや
Just touching your hair, it hurts, no, no, no.

193
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:42,532
でも甘いな いやいや Goodbye
But it's sweet, no, no, goodbye.

194
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:47,132
それじゃ僕にとって君は何？
Then, what are you to me?

195
00:20:47,132 --> 00:20:53,332
答えは分からない 分かりたくもないのさ
I don't know the answer, and I don't want to know.

196
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:59,832
たった一つ確かなことが あるとするのならば
If there's only one thing for certain,

197
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:06,532
君は綺麗だ
You are beautiful.

198
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:13,232
誰かが偉そうに語る 恋愛の論理
Some logic of love that someone talks about so pompously,

199
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:18,432
何一つとしてピンとこなくて
None of it really clicks for me.

200
00:21:18,432 --> 00:21:23,032
飛行機の窓から見下ろした
It's like looking down from an airplane window

201
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:28,032
知らない街の夜景みたいだ
At the night view of an unknown city.

202
00:21:29,032 --> 00:21:32,832
もっと違う設定で もっと違う関係で
In a different setting, in a different relationship,

203
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:38,932
出会える世界線 選べたらよかった
I wish I could've chosen a worldline where we met.

204
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:44,232
いたって純な心で 叶った恋を抱きしめて
With a very pure heart, holding onto a love that came true,

205
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:49,032
「好きだ」とか無責任に言えたらいいな
I wish I could say "I love you" so irresponsibly.

206
00:21:49,032 --> 00:21:54,032
そう願っても虚しいのさ
But even if I wish for that, it's hollow.

207
00:21:54,832 --> 00:21:59,832
Goodbye つないだ手の向こうに エンドライン
Goodbye, an end-line beyond our joined hands.

208
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:06,232
引き伸ばすたびに 疼きだす未来には
In the future that starts to ache every time I prolong it,

209
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:12,732
君はいない その事実に 痛いや いやいや
You aren't there. Facing that fact, it hurts, no, no, no.

210
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:17,532
それじゃ苦しいよな
That would be painful, wouldn't it?

211
00:22:36,532 --> 00:22:41,532
Goodbye 君の運命の人は僕じゃない
Goodbye, the one destined for you isn't me.

212
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:48,032
辛いけど否めない でも離れ難いのさ
It's painful but undeniable, yet it's hard to let go.

213
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:54,632
その髪に触れただけで 痛いや いやいや
Just touching your hair, it hurts, no, no, no.

214
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:58,532
子でも甘いな いやいや Goodbye
But it's sweet, no, no, goodbye.

215
00:22:58,532 --> 00:23:02,832
それじゃ僕にとって君は何？
Then, what are you to me?

216
00:23:02,832 --> 00:23:09,132
答えは分からない 分かりたくもないのさ
I don't know the answer, and I don't want to know.

217
00:23:09,132 --> 00:23:15,532
たった一つ確かなことが あるとするのならば
If there's only one thing for certain,

218
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:22,032
君は綺麗だ
You are beautiful.

219
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:28,232
それも分かってるんだ
I know that too.

220
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:42,532
とても綺麗だ
You are very beautiful.

221
00:24:12,432 --> 00:24:16,432
天使にふれたよ！

Tenshi ni Fureta yo! (We touched an Angel!)
Lyrics: Emi Inaba Composition: Susumu Kawaguchi

222
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:24,432
ねえ 思い出の欠片に
Hey, if I were to name...

223
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:29,832
名前をつけて保存するなら
...the fragments of our memories and save them...

224
00:24:29,832 --> 00:24:36,432
「宝物」がぴったりだね
..."Treasure" would be the perfect name.

225
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:41,432
そう 心の容量が
Yeah, we spent so much time together...

226
00:24:41,432 --> 00:24:46,532
いっぱいになるくらいに過ごしたね
...that my heart's capacity is almost full.

227
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:52,532
ときめき色の毎日
Every day was colored with excitement.

228
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:58,032
なじんだ制服と上履き
Our familiar uniforms and indoor shoes.

229
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,140
思い出がいっぱい
So many memories

230
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,940
明日の意味 口に
Speaking of tomorrow's meaning

231
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,940
置いてかなくちゃいけないのかな
I wonder if I have to leave it behind

232
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,440
でもね、会えたよ！
But you know, I met one!

233
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,340
素敵な天使に
A wonderful angel

234
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,840
卒業は終わりじゃない
Graduation isn't the end

235
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,840
これからも仲間だから
Because we'll always be friends

236
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,840
一緒の写真たち
The photos we took together

237
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,240
おそろのキーホルダー
Our matching keychains

238
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,240
いつまでも輝いてる
They'll shine forever

239
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,040
ずっと その笑顔 ありがとう
For that smile, always, thank you

240
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,140
君たち、あんまり上手くないね。
You guys aren't very good, are you?

241
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:50,540
え？
Eh?

242
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,840
でも、すごく楽しそうだったよ。
But you looked like you were having a lot of fun.

243
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,140
何、このおじさん？
Who is this old guy?

244
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,340
何？誰？
What? Who?

245
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,240
不審者？
A suspicious person?

246
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,540
僕の事務所に入らないかい？
Would you like to join my agency?

247
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,340
えーーー！？
Ehhh!?

248
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,140
う、嘘！これ、これってスカウト！？
N-No way! Is this... is this a scout!?

249
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,540
メジャーデビューぺこ！？
A major debut, peko!?

250
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,540
メジャーデビュー！？
A major debut!?

251
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,540
メジャーデビュー！？
A major debut!?

252
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,540
メジャーデビュー！？
A major debut!?

253
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,540
やったーーー！！
We did it!!

254
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,040
Crow Song

255
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,240
廃校にはシャッターの壁
The closed school has walls of shutters

256
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,240
指先は鉄の匂い
My fingertips smell like iron

257
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:57,040
進め、弾け、どの道混むでしょう
Go forth, burst open, either way it'll be crowded

258
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,048
Fly away ここから
Fly away from here

259
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:02,148
Fly away ここから
Fly away from here

260
00:30:02,248 --> 00:30:03,248
凡な 奴らが
Ordinary people like us

261
00:30:03,348 --> 00:30:04,348
凡な 奴らが
Ordinary people like us

262
00:30:04,448 --> 00:30:05,548
Love を 奏でろ
Play love

263
00:30:05,648 --> 00:30:06,648
Love を 奏でろ
Play love

264
00:30:06,748 --> 00:30:07,748
Love を 見据えろ
Gaze at love

265
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:08,848
Love を 見据えろ
Gaze at love

266
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:25,548
息さえできない 街の中
In a town where I can't even breathe

267
00:30:26,348 --> 00:30:30,548
星空が 最高の舞台
The starry sky is the best stage

268
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:35,548
カラスたちが カカと鳴くよ
The crows are cawing away

269
00:30:36,548 --> 00:30:41,548
いつも思うよ いつ寝てるんだろう
I always wonder, when do they ever sleep?

270
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:43,348
Fly away 私も
Fly away, I too

271
00:30:43,448 --> 00:30:44,448
Fly away 私も
Fly away, I too

272
00:30:44,548 --> 00:30:45,548
そっと 歌うよ
I'll sing softly

273
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:46,648
そっと 歌うよ
I'll sing softly

274
00:30:46,748 --> 00:30:47,748
Love を響かせ
Let love ring out

275
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:48,848
Love を響かせ
Let love ring out

276
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:50,048
そっと 歌うよ
I'll sing softly

277
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,148
そっと 歌うよ
I'll sing softly

278
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:07,548
いつまでこんなところにいる
How long will you stay in a place like this?

279
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:10,548
そう言う奴もいた気がする
I feel like someone once said that

280
00:31:10,648 --> 00:31:14,048
うるさいことだけ言うのなら
If you're only going to say annoying things

281
00:31:14,148 --> 00:31:17,548
漆黒の羽にさらわれて
Be swept away by jet-black wings

282
00:31:17,648 --> 00:31:21,048
消えていけ
Fade away

283
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:52,548
全力でも倒れそうだ
I feel like I might collapse even with full effort

284
00:31:53,548 --> 00:31:57,048
指先 擦り切れて 痛い
My fingertips are frayed and hurting

285
00:31:58,548 --> 00:32:03,548
でもね やるよ 今夜も熱いストーリー
But I'll do it, tonight too, a hot story

286
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:07,348
Fly away ここから
Fly away from here

287
00:32:07,448 --> 00:32:08,448
Fly away ここから
Fly away from here

288
00:32:08,548 --> 00:32:09,548
凡な 奴らが
Ordinary people like us

289
00:32:09,648 --> 00:32:10,648
凡な 奴らが
Ordinary people like us

290
00:32:10,748 --> 00:32:11,748
Love を 奏でろ
Play love

291
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:12,848
Love を 奏でろ
Play love

292
00:32:12,948 --> 00:32:13,948
Love を 歌うよ
I'll sing love

293
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:15,048
Love を 歌うよ
I'll sing love

294
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:31,548
いつまでだってここにいるよ
I'll be here forever

295
00:32:31,648 --> 00:32:35,048
通り過ぎてゆく人の中
Among the people passing by

296
00:32:35,148 --> 00:32:38,348
闇に閉ざされたステージで
On a stage closed in darkness

297
00:32:38,448 --> 00:32:41,548
今 希望の歌 歌うよ
Now, I'll sing a song of hope

298
00:32:41,648 --> 00:32:45,048
あなただって疲れてるでしょう
You must be tired too, right?

299
00:32:45,148 --> 00:32:48,348
その背中にも届けたいよ
I want to reach that back too

300
00:32:48,448 --> 00:32:51,548
こんな暗闇の中から
From within this darkness

301
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:55,048
希望 照らす 光の歌を
A song of light that illuminates hope

302
00:32:55,148 --> 00:32:59,548
その歌を
That song

303
00:33:22,048 --> 00:33:25,048
星座になれたら
If I Could Become a Constellation

304
00:33:42,548 --> 00:33:45,548
真っ暗 街は 6時
Pitch black town at 6 o'clock

305
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,548
もうそこに 一番星
Already there, the first star

306
00:33:48,648 --> 00:33:56,548
影を踏んで 夜に紛れたくなる 帰り道
Stepping on shadows, wanting to be lost in the night on the way home

307
00:33:57,548 --> 00:34:01,048
どんなに探してみても
No matter how much I look

308
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:04,548
ひとつしかない星
The one and only star

309
00:34:04,648 --> 00:34:13,548
何万光年 離れたところから あんなに輝く
Shining like that from tens of thousands of light-years away

310
00:34:14,548 --> 00:34:21,548
いいな 君は みんなから愛されて
Must be nice, you, being loved by everyone

311
00:34:22,548 --> 00:34:28,548
いいや 僕は ずっと一人きりさ
Nah, I've always been all alone

312
00:34:29,348 --> 00:34:33,548
君と集まって星座になれたら
If I could gather with you and become a constellation

313
00:34:33,648 --> 00:34:38,548
星降る夜 一瞬の願いごと
A starry night, a fleeting wish

314
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:45,048
きらめいて ゆらめいて 震えてるシグナル
Sparkling, swaying, a trembling signal

315
00:34:45,148 --> 00:34:49,548
君と集まって星座になれたら
If I could gather with you and become a constellation

316
00:34:49,648 --> 00:34:54,048
空見上げて指を差されるような
Like being pointed at while looking up at the sky

317
00:34:54,148 --> 00:34:58,048
繋いだ線 ほどかないで
Don't undo the connected line

318
00:34:58,148 --> 00:35:00,048
僕が...
I...

319
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,470
どんなに眩しくても
No matter how bright it is

320
00:35:11,506 --> 00:35:14,686
まっすぐ 時計は ８時
The clock is straight at 8 o'clock

321
00:35:14,686 --> 00:35:17,456
夜空に待ってんの　星
Stars waiting in the night sky

322
00:35:18,306 --> 00:35:21,086
何光年離れたところには
Millions of light-years away

323
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:26,556
もう無いかもしれない
They might not even be there anymore

324
00:35:28,476 --> 00:35:34,856
月が嫌いで 泣きそうになるのは
The reason I hate the moon and feel like crying

325
00:35:35,376 --> 00:35:41,816
いつの日にか 別れが来るから
Is because one day, we'll have to part

326
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:46,526
君と集まって星座になれたら
If I could gather with you and become a constellation

327
00:35:46,526 --> 00:35:51,406
彗星みたいな流れる独り言
A flowing monologue like a comet

328
00:35:51,906 --> 00:35:58,816
消えてゆく残像は 真夜中のプリズム
The fading afterimage is a midnight prism

329
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:03,156
君と集まって星座になれたら
If I could gather with you and become a constellation

330
00:36:03,156 --> 00:36:07,506
切なる願いが誰かに届いたら
If my earnest wish reached someone

331
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,036
変われるかな
I wonder if I can change

332
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:16,256
夜の淵をなぞるような こんな僕でも
Even someone like me who traces the edge of the night

333
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:37,406
はるか彼方 僕ら出会ってしまった
In the far distance, we happened to meet

334
00:36:38,256 --> 00:36:44,556
カルマだから 何度も出会ってしまうよ
Because it's karma, we'll meet again and again

335
00:36:46,056 --> 00:36:49,056
雲の隙間で
Between the gaps of the clouds

336
00:36:50,856 --> 00:36:54,056
君と集まって星座になれたら
If I could gather with you and become a constellation

337
00:36:54,056 --> 00:36:58,206
夜広げて描こうよ空言
Let's spread out the night and draw fabrications

338
00:36:59,156 --> 00:37:05,736
暗闇を照らすような 満月じゃなくても
Even if it's not a full moon that lights up the darkness

339
00:37:06,906 --> 00:37:10,006
だから集まって星座になりたい
That's why I want us to gather and become a constellation

340
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:14,336
色とりどりの光放つような
One that emits multicolored lights

341
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:17,706
繋いだ線　解かないよ
I won't let go of the connected lines

342
00:37:17,706 --> 00:37:23,756
君がどんなに眩しくても
No matter how bright you are

343
00:37:45,436 --> 00:37:48,856
無事にメジャーデビューし 羽ばたく4人
Successfully making their major debut, the four take flight

344
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:51,856
時に支え合い
Supporting each other at times

345
00:37:53,456 --> 00:37:55,756
あ、ここは、からの、こう、こう
Ah, from here, then, like this, and this

346
00:37:55,756 --> 00:37:56,556
あー、OK OK
Ah, okay okay

347
00:37:56,556 --> 00:37:58,556
いい、いい、いい
Good, good, good

348
00:38:03,556 --> 00:38:04,656
せーの、で！
Ready, go!

349
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:10,456
じゃあ、船長は...
Then, the Captain will...

350
00:38:14,256 --> 00:38:16,056
大丈夫！？
Are you okay!?

351
00:38:16,556 --> 00:38:17,956
時にケンカし
Quarreling at times

352
00:38:20,556 --> 00:38:23,556
見てフレア、ちゃんと、目！ 目！ 目！
Look Flare, look properly, eyes! Eyes! Eyes!

353
00:38:23,556 --> 00:38:26,056
仲良くして、仲良く
Get along, get along

354
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:29,056
嫌って言ってるでしょ、ぺこちゃん
I said no, Peko-chan

355
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:29,856
ねぇ、お願いだって
Hey, I'm asking you

356
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:31,556
嫌だって、やらないといけない
I said no, but we have to do it

357
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:33,056
もうー、お願い！
Jeez, please!

358
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:34,556
嫌ー！
No!

359
00:38:38,256 --> 00:38:39,556
そして
And then

360
00:38:39,556 --> 00:38:41,856
最後(不穏)の舞台へ
To the final (unsettling) stage

361
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:25,156
午前二時 踏切に 望遠鏡を 担いでった
2 AM at the railroad crossing, I carried my telescope

362
00:39:25,806 --> 00:39:31,456
ベルトに 結んだ ラジオ 雨は 降らないらしい
Radio tied to my belt, they said it wouldn't rain

363
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:37,356
二分後 君が来た 大袈裟な 荷物背負ってきた
Two minutes later, you arrived, carrying an exaggerated amount of luggage

364
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:43,656
始めようか 天体観測 ほうき星を 探して
Shall we begin our celestial observation, searching for a comet?

365
00:39:44,156 --> 00:39:49,256
深い 闇に 飲まれないように 精一杯 歌った
I sang with all my might so as not to be swallowed by the deep darkness

366
00:39:49,856 --> 00:39:54,856
君の 震える 手を 握ろうとした あの日は
That day when I tried to hold your trembling hand

367
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:58,856
見えないものを 見ようとして 望遠鏡を...
Trying to see things that can't be seen, peering through the telescope...

368
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:00,664
天体観測
Stargazing

369
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:01,464
...ほうき星を待っている
...waiting for a comet

370
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:02,864
望遠鏡を覗き込んだ
I looked through my telescope

371
00:40:02,864 --> 00:40:06,164
静寂を切り裂いて いくつも声が生まれたよ
Tearing through the silence, many voices were born

372
00:40:06,164 --> 00:40:09,664
明日が僕らを呼んだって 返事もろくにしなかった
Even if tomorrow called us, we didn't even answer

373
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:13,064
今というほうき星 君と二人追いかけていた
That comet called "now", I was chasing it with you

374
00:40:13,064 --> 00:40:18,564
Oh yeah, ah...

375
00:40:21,064 --> 00:40:24,064
気がつけばいつだって ひたすら何か探している
I realized I'm always searching for something

376
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:27,464
幸せの定義とか 悲しみの置き場とか
The definition of happiness, or a place for sadness

377
00:40:27,464 --> 00:40:30,464
生まれたら死ぬまで ずっと探してるさ
From birth to death, I'll be searching forever

378
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:33,864
始めようか天体観測 ほうき星をさがして
Let's start our stargazing, searching for a comet

379
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:37,364
今まで見つけたものは 全部覚えている
I remember everything I've found so far

380
00:40:37,364 --> 00:40:41,564
君の震える手を 握れなかった痛みも
Even the pain of not being able to hold your trembling hand

381
00:40:56,564 --> 00:40:59,864
知らないものを知ろうとして 望遠鏡を覗き込んだ
Trying to know the unknown, I looked through my telescope

382
00:40:59,864 --> 00:41:03,164
暗闇を照らすような 微かな光探したよ
I searched for a faint light that would light up the darkness

383
00:41:03,164 --> 00:41:06,664
そして知った痛みを 今だに僕は覚えている
And the pain I learned then, I still remember it even now

384
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:10,164
今というほうき星 今も一人追いかけている
That comet called "now", I'm still chasing it alone even now

385
00:41:10,164 --> 00:41:18,064
Oh yeah, ah...

386
00:41:25,864 --> 00:41:29,264
背が伸びるにつれて 伝えたい事も増えてった
As I grew taller, the things I wanted to say increased

387
00:41:29,264 --> 00:41:32,664
宛名のない手紙も 崩れるほど重なった
Even the letters without addresses piled up until they collapsed

388
00:41:32,664 --> 00:41:35,964
僕は元気でいるよ 心配事も少ないよ
I'm doing well, I have few worries

389
00:41:35,964 --> 00:41:40,564
ただ一つ今も 思い出すよ
Except just one thing I still remember now

390
00:41:48,864 --> 00:41:52,264
予報外れの雨に 打たれて泣き出しそうな
Struck by unexpected rain, looking like you're about to cry

391
00:41:52,264 --> 00:41:55,664
君の震える手を 握れなかったあの日を
The day I couldn't hold your trembling hand

392
00:41:55,664 --> 00:41:58,964
見えてるものを見落として 望遠鏡をまた担いで
Overlooking what was visible, I shouldered my telescope again

393
00:41:58,964 --> 00:42:02,464
静寂と暗闇の 帰り道を駆け抜けた
I ran through the way home of silence and darkness

394
00:42:02,464 --> 00:42:05,864
そして知った痛みが 今だに僕を支えている
And the pain I learned then is still supporting me now

395
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:09,164
今というほうき星 今も一人追いかけている
That comet called "now", I'm still chasing it alone even now

396
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,864
もう一度君に会おうとして 望遠鏡をまた担いで
Trying to meet you once more, I shouldered my telescope again

397
00:42:16,864 --> 00:42:20,164
前と同じ午前二時 踏切まで駆けてくよ
Just like before at 2 AM, I'll run to the railroad crossing

398
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:23,564
始めようか天体観測 二分後に君が来なくとも
Let's start our stargazing, even if you don't come in two minutes

399
00:42:23,564 --> 00:42:27,064
今というほうき星 君と二人追いかけている
That comet called "now", I'm chasing it with you

400
00:42:27,064 --> 00:42:32,064
Oh yeah, ah...

401
00:43:12,064 --> 00:43:14,264
ありがとー！
Thank you!

402
00:43:14,264 --> 00:43:15,564
ありがとー！
Thank you!

403
00:43:16,564 --> 00:43:18,264
あつーいねー！
It's hot, isn't it!

404
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:20,564
あつーい！最高！
It's hot! The best!

405
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:21,864
熱いと言ったらー？
When we say "hot", then...?

406
00:43:22,064 --> 00:43:24,064
水着ー！！
Swimsuits!!

407
00:43:32,064 --> 00:43:34,564
こんなに立派になって...
You've become so grand...

408
00:43:34,564 --> 00:43:38,064
やっぱり君たちは最高だよ。
You guys really are the best.

409
00:43:45,064 --> 00:43:46,064
小さな恋のうた
A Small Love Song

410
00:43:46,064 --> 00:43:49,164
広い宇宙の数ある一つ
One of many in the vast universe

411
00:43:49,164 --> 00:43:52,564
青い地球の広い世界で
In the wide world of the blue Earth

412
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:55,864
小さな恋の思いは届く
A small love's feelings reach

413
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:59,264
小さな島のあなたのもとへ
To you on a small island

414
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:02,564
あなたと出会い 時は流れる
Meeting you, time flows

415
00:44:02,564 --> 00:44:05,864
思いを込めた 手紙も増える
The letters filled with my feelings increase

416
00:44:05,864 --> 00:44:09,164
いつの間にか二人響く
Before we knew it, we both resonate

417
00:44:09,164 --> 00:44:12,564
時に激しく 時に切なく
Sometimes intensely, sometimes painfully

418
00:44:12,564 --> 00:44:15,864
響くは遠く はるか彼方へ
Resonating far, to the distant beyond

419
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:19,164
優しい歌は 世界を変える
A gentle song changes the world

420
00:44:34,364 --> 00:44:37,564
ほら あなたにとって大事な人ほど
Look, the more important someone is to you

421
00:44:37,564 --> 00:44:40,864
すぐそばにいるの
The closer they are to you

422
00:44:42,864 --> 00:44:46,364
ただ あなたにだけ届いて欲しい
I just want it to reach only you

423
00:44:46,364 --> 00:44:49,664
響け恋の歌
Resonate, song of love

424
00:44:51,364 --> 00:44:54,664
ほら
Look

425
00:44:55,764 --> 00:44:59,064
ほら
Look

426
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:04,272
（歌唱）
(Vocalizing)

427
00:45:04,272 --> 00:45:06,572
響け恋の歌
Let the love song ring out

428
00:45:14,117 --> 00:45:17,972
握りしめた手　離すことなく
Holding hands tightly, never letting go

429
00:45:17,972 --> 00:45:22,272
思いは強く　永遠誓う
Our thoughts are strong, we swear eternity

430
00:45:22,272 --> 00:45:26,172
永遠の淵　きっと僕は言う
