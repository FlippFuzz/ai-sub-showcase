Huh? Your voices aren't loud enough yet, are they?

6
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,266
Our night's just begun, aye let's blast it.

From shore to shore, my moves bring the storm to the floor

13
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:56,566
Thunder rays blast a sonic boom, I ride the beat like I'm surfing shockwaves

14
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,800
Don't need no sunblock, I can make it rain 'cause you hit the jackpot

15

I have more charms than the grains of sand. You're already captivated, aren't you?

29
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,066
「お年の数程」って誰が言った？
Who said 'as many as her age'?

30
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,300
大人の魅力よ
It's adult charm.

31

Fishing a big catch, the stardom I deserve

37
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:08,200
But I'm just chilling, a mocktail, Maitai sipping

38
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,133
'Cause I got that juice

39
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,833

やん見ないで、待って
Oh, don't look... wait.

43
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:22,300
Beside a bonfire, our luring smoke takes you higher

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,933
ねぇ We drive you crazy
Hey, we drive you crazy.

いけないことだったって、分かっていたのに
In truth, I knew.
I knew it was something I shouldn't do, and yet...

65
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:54,448
この手をすり抜ける全部が愛に見えたの
Everything that slipped through my hands looked like love.

66
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:58,648
確かめていた言葉が形になって、揺れるだけ
The words I was confirming just take shape and sway.

67
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:02,548
確かめていた言葉が形になって、揺れるだけ
The words I was confirming just take shape and sway.

68
00:06:02,548 --> 00:06:06,448
弾いて、描いて きっと、それだけ
Plucking, drawing, surely that's all.

69
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:10,448
つまらない正解の読み合わせ
Comparing boring correct answers.

70
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:14,348
あとちょっとで分かりかけていたのに
I was just about to understand.

71
00:06:14,348 --> 00:06:18,448
飲んで、吐いて 全部忘れちゃえ
Drink, vomit, and forget it all.

72
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:22,248
Overdose 君とふたり やるせない日々
Overdose, just the two of us, these helpless days.

73
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:26,548
解像度の悪い夢を見たい
I want to see a low-resolution dream.

74
00:06:26,548 --> 00:06:30,648
Overdose 君とふたり 甘いハッタリ
Overdose, just the two of us, a sweet bluff.

75

Don't stop it music, darling

76
00:06:43,448 --> 00:06:46,848
本当に分かっている？
いけないことだったって、分かっている？
Do you really understand?
Do you understand it was something we shouldn't do?

77
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:50,948
多分、時間だけが過ぎていく 問答で満ちていく
Probably only time passes, filling up with questions.

78
00:06:50,948 --> 00:06:54,848
言い訳する間もなく、裸になってしまうだけ
Without time for excuses, I just end up exposed.

79
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:58,748
言い訳する間もなく、裸になってしまうだけ
Without time for excuses, I just end up exposed.

80
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:02,548
きっと、溜まっていくんだ ずっと
Surely, it'll keep piling up, forever.

81
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:06,748
終わってしまえばいいと、ふっと
Suddenly wishing it would all just end.

82
00:07:06,748 --> 00:07:10,748
あの甘い果実のように僕ら、壊れていく
Like that sweet fruit, we're breaking down.

83
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:14,748
踊って、眠って 全部忘れちゃえ
Dance, sleep, and forget it all.

84
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:18,448
Overdose 君とふたり 分かりたいのに
Overdose, just the two of us, I want to understand you, but...

85
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:23,448
変に間の悪い嘘が嫌い
I hate lies with strangely bad timing.

92
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:10,548
Overdose 君とふたり 分からないけど
Overdose, just the two of us, I don't know but...

93
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:14,548
変に間の悪い夢でもいいから
Even a dream with strangely bad timing is fine.

94
00:08:14,548 --> 00:08:18,448
Overdose 君とふたり 甘いハッタリ
Overdose, just the two of us, a sweet bluff.

95

お誕生日おめでとー！
Happy Birthday!

214
00:16:27,978 --> 00:16:34,478
ありがとうございます！ありがとうございます！ということでね、もう今日はヒメヒナさんと言ったら
Thank you! Thank you! So, today, speaking of HimeHina-san,

215
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:37,478
この、アイパイドンスホールを3人で歌っちゃいました！
we sang this "I Pipe Dancehall" as a trio!

216
00:16:37,478 --> 00:16:39,478
イェーイ！やったー！最高！
Yay! We did it! The best!

217
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:42,978
3人バージョンめちゃめちゃ楽しい！めっちゃ可愛くなってて、もうすごい嬉しかったんですけど。
The trio version is so much fun! It turned out so cute, I'm really happy.

218
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:46,478
船長的にお、さ、一番最初ね、この曲選んでパート分け作ったときに、
As the captain, when I first chose this song and made the part division,

219
00:16:46,478 --> 00:16:49,478
もう、なんか、え、待って、マリンがノイズすぎると思って
I was like, wait, Marine is too much of a noise...

220
00:16:49,478 --> 00:16:50,478
なんで！？
Why!?

221
00:16:50,478 --> 00:16:53,478
めっちゃパート少なくしてたの。
I made my part so small.

222
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:54,478
そうなの！？
Is that so!?

223
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:57,978
そう。サビとか、これ全部ヒメヒナさんに歌ってほしいと思って。
Yeah. For the chorus and all, I wanted HimeHina-san to sing it all.

224
00:16:57,978 --> 00:17:04,478
マリンが歌っちゃダメだと思って、自分のライブなのになぜかヒメヒナさんだらけの状態にしてたら、
I thought Marine shouldn't sing, so I made it all HimeHina-san even though it's my own live...

225
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:06,978
ヒメヒナさんサイドから、「いやこれマリンさんのパート増やしてください」みたいな
From HimeHina-san's side, they were like, "No, please increase Marine-san's parts."

226
00:17:07,478 --> 00:17:08,978
主役ですから！
Because you're the star!

227
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:12,978
本当だよ！お前が少なすぎっから！
Seriously! You had too few!

228
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:16,478
いっぱい歌わせていただきました。でもすごい一緒に歌えて楽しかったです！ありがとうございました。
I got to sing a lot. But it was so much fun singing together! Thank you.

229
00:17:16,478 --> 00:17:17,978
ありがとうございました！
Thank you!

230
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:24,478
フォーメーションもね、3人バージョンに、この日のために練習して。可愛くなりました。
The formation too, we practiced a trio version for this day. It turned out cute.

231
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:28,978
ありがとうございます！嬉しい、本当に嬉しいです。もう、生でこの歌声が聞けたことがもう感動。
Thank you! I'm happy, really happy. Hearing these voices live was moving.

232
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:29,978
こちらもです！
Us too!

233
00:17:29,978 --> 00:17:30,478
本当にだよ！
Seriously!

234
00:17:30,478 --> 00:17:35,478
こちらもです。そうそう、あ、めっちゃ豪華パイ。あ、どうもどうも。
Us too. Yeah, yeah, ah, such a gorgeous 'pai'. Ah, thank you, thank you.

235
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:38,978
歌って踊ってもらっても最高ですよ！
It's the best having you sing and dance!

236
00:17:38,978 --> 00:17:42,978
ありがとうございます。もう一曲が、め組のひと、なんですけど、これなんで選んだと思いますか？
Thank you. The other song was "Me-gumi no Hito," but why do you think I chose it?

237
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:45,478
え、なんで？
Eh, why?

238
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:49,478
えー、ヒメちゃん、お歌が、こう、歌謡曲が好きだから、みたいな？
Eh, because Hime-chan likes, like, Showa-era pop songs?

239
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:51,478
うん、そう。そうなんですけど。
Yeah, that's true.

240
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:55,478
あの、この「め組のひと」って、あの倖田來未さんのバージョンがあるんですけど、
You know, for "Me-gumi no Hito," there's a Koda Kumi version...

241
00:17:55,478 --> 00:17:58,478
おお、おお、おお。
Oh, oh, oh.

242
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:03,478
ま、今日この、そのキーなんですけど。なんか、そのキー聞いてるときにね、
Well, today we used that key. While listening to that key, I thought,

243
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:03,978
「あ、これヒメヒナさん、むっちゃ合う！」これって。
"Ah, this fits HimeHina-san perfectly!"

244
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:04,978
本当！？
Really!?

245
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:08,978
「これもう半分倖田來未やん」と思って。
I thought, "This is basically half Koda Kumi already."

246
00:18:08,978 --> 00:18:14,978
恐れ多いよ！恐れ多いよ！絶対合うと思って。3人で歌ったら熱いかなと思って選ばせていただきました！
That's too much praise! I thought it would definitely fit. I chose it thinking it would be hot as a trio!

247
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:18,978
めちゃめちゃ楽しかった！歌いやすかったんじゃないですか？めっちゃ合ってたから。
It was so much fun! Wasn't it easy to sing? Because it fit so well.

248
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:26,478
めちゃめちゃいい。そうですよね、もう、めっちゃ声シナジーあって、歌いやすかっただろうなと思って。
It's so good. Right, the vocal synergy was amazing, I thought it must have been easy to sing.

249
00:18:26,478 --> 00:18:30,978
もうすごい美声だったんで、何回もね、繰り返し聴いていただきたいなと思います。
It was such a beautiful voice, I hope everyone listens to it over and over.

250
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:32,478
ぜひ！ヒナも聴こ。
By all means! Hina will listen too.

251
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,478
地味に、今日、初絡みなんです。我々。
Quietly, today is actually our first time interacting. Us.

252
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:37,478
そうなんですー！
That's right!

253
00:18:37,978 --> 00:18:43,478
実は。ちょっと、あの、時系列的に、もう、あの、お邪魔してるヒメヒナさんチャンネルにお邪魔した後になってるんですけど。
Actually. Chronologically, this is after I've already visited the HimeHina channel as a guest...

254
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:46,478
でも、ここが初絡みなんですよね！
But *this* is our first interaction!

255
00:18:46,478 --> 00:18:51,978
初めまして！初めまして！時系列的には初めまして！
Nice to meet you! Nice to meet you! Chronologically, nice to meet you!

256
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:56,978
もうなんか、すごい、全然、もう全然まだドキドキモードが抜けてなくて。すみません。
It's like, really, the nervous mode hasn't left me yet. Sorry.

257
00:18:56,978 --> 00:19:00,478
なんかさっき「お前」って感じで来てほしいって言われたけど、いけないいけない。
Earlier I was told to act like "Hey you (omae)", but I can't, I can't.

258
00:19:01,478 --> 00:19:05,978
ちょっと、行くには、もうちょっと、なんかウザ絡みしてくれないと。
To go there, I need you to, like, bother me a bit more.

259
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,978
ウザ絡み？なんか、いい人すぎて、「お前」ってならない！
Bother you? You're too nice, we can't say "Hey you"!

260
00:19:09,978 --> 00:19:12,478
パッパッパンチ！やるか！？やるかてめえ！
Pa-pa-punch! You wanna go!? You wanna go, you!

261
00:19:12,478 --> 00:19:19,978
一生懸命！一生懸命！無理して戦ってますが。
Doing our best! Doing our best! We're struggling to fight, but.

262
00:19:20,478 --> 00:19:24,478
いや、ありがとうございます。これからもぜひ、一緒に歌ったりなんだりかんだり。
No, thank you. From now on, let's definitely sing together and do various things.

263
00:19:24,478 --> 00:19:27,978
そうだ、そうだ！本当にコラボしたいな！しましょう！
Right, right! I really want to collab! Let's do it!

264
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:30,978
あとさ、動画でなんかやりたい！
Also, I want to do something in a video!

Let's do it! Because I love you guys! I love the original songs too!

266
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:38,978
え、ありがとうございます。いっぱい聴いてるよ。え、ちょっと待って、
Eh, thank you. I listen to them a lot. Eh, wait a minute,

267
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,478
でもマリンがここに挟まったら処刑されちゃうって。なんで！
but if Marine gets sandwiched here, I'll be executed. Why!

268
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:45,478
挟む、挟む。待って、もう顔のデカさが、ちょっと、もう引いて引いて。
Sandwich, sandwich. Wait, my face size is, just, pull back, pull back.

269
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:48,978
イェーイ！フレームみたいになってる我々。ヒメヒナフレーム！
Yay! We're like a frame. HimeHina frame!

270
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:53,478
あ、可愛い！最高最高！ありがとうございます！スクショ、スクショ撮って！
Ah, cute! The best! Thank you! Screenshot, take a screenshot!

271
00:19:53,478 --> 00:19:56,478
あ、撮ってください。いい感じ、超可愛い！
Ah, please take one. It's looking good, so cute!

272
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:59,478
マリン！あ、カメラのアングルすごい！いい！あ、もう時間だ。
Marine! Ah, the camera angle is amazing! Good! Ah, it's time.

273
00:20:01,793 --> 00:20:03,893
それでは次の曲、いきたいと思います！
Now, I'd like to move on to the next song!

274
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:04,893
いきますよー！
Here we go!

275
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:06,093
出航ー！
Set sail!

276
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:06,993

Yes, perfect!

やったー、できたー！
Yay, we did it!

279
00:20:08,993 --> 00:20:10,093
間違えなかった！
I didn't make a mistake!

280
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:10,993
間違えるな！
Don't make mistakes!

281
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:28,493
いつか観ていた映画の中みたい
Like a scene from a movie I once saw

282
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:37,493
工事中の駅前 空へ背伸びしていくビルディング
In front of the station under construction,
buildings stretching towards the sky

283
00:20:38,293 --> 00:20:44,693
ヒールが鳴らすリズムと命の音が揃う
The rhythm of my heels matches the sound of life

284
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:48,493
あたしはまだ未完成で不完全
I am still unfinished and incomplete

285
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:54,493
起死回生のハウツー知ってるの
I know the how-to for a miraculous comeback

286
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:02,493
今が一番若いの 第六感、六感またがって
I'm the youngest right now, straddling my
sixth sense, my sixth sense

287
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:05,993
今日は年甲斐ないことしたいの
Today, I want to do something not act my age

288
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:09,993
予定にないこと 第六感、六感教えて
Something unplanned, sixth sense, tell me

289
00:21:10,493 --> 00:21:15,993
物足りないの 引き合いたいよ 偶然とハートしたい
It's not enough, I want to be drawn to you,
I want to have a heart with coincidence

290
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:34,993
さぁおいでませ 旋律 誰彼 I got it
Come one, come all, melody, whoever, I got it

291
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:38,693
道連れ世は情け I got it
In this world of traveling companions, there is
kindness, I got it

292
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:42,293
ご覧じませ この手立て
Witness this method

293
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:45,493
弱さ凌ぐ一手工にあり
There's a clever move to overcome weakness

294
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:52,993
いつか話した予想とは違っているものさ
It's different from the prediction we once talked
about

295
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:58,693
そんな悲しまないでいいよ
You don't have to be so sad

296
00:21:59,993 --> 00:22:03,493
今が一番早いの 第六感、六感あやかかって
I'm the fastest right now, benefiting from
my sixth sense, my sixth sense

297
00:22:03,993 --> 00:22:06,993
疾走るハート嘘はつけないよ
I can't lie to my racing heart

298
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,993
台詞にない言葉 交換、交換おしえて
Exchange words not in the script, tell me, tell me

299
00:22:11,493 --> 00:22:17,293
そうくだらないを言い合いたい 特別を感じたい
I want to say silly things to each other, I want
to feel special

300
00:22:18,493 --> 00:22:24,993
産声をあげた日は理由もなく泣いていたのに
On the day I was born, I was crying for no reason

301
00:22:25,693 --> 00:22:31,993
今僕ら泣くことすら上手くできずに
Now we can't even cry well

302
00:22:32,693 --> 00:22:39,293
されどしかと死守せよ 品格と真似できぬプライドを
But firmly protect your dignity and incomparable
pride

303
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:45,993
せーので手放せよ 感覚で胸を打つものそれ以外を
On the count of three, let go of everything except
what strikes your heart by intuition

304
00:22:51,993 --> 00:22:56,993
Crazy about this thing

305
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:04,693
今が一番若いの 第六感、六感またがって
I'm the youngest right now, straddling my
sixth sense, my sixth sense

306
00:23:04,993 --> 00:23:07,993
今日は年甲斐ないことしたいの
Today, I want to do something not act my age

307
00:23:08,493 --> 00:23:14,693
予定にないこと 第六感、六感教えて おしえて おしえて
Something unplanned, sixth sense, tell me, tell me,
tell me

308
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:18,993
今最高潮なんです 第六感、六感またがって
I'm at my peak right now, straddling my
sixth sense, my sixth sense

309
00:23:19,493 --> 00:23:22,493
このまま何処までいけるの
How far can we go like this?

310
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:25,993
途方も無いままで 第六感、六感おしえて
While being immense, sixth sense, tell me

311
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:32,493
もう揺るがないこの速度は そう偶然とハートしたい
This speed is no longer wavering, yes, I want to
have a heart with coincidence

312
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:57,693
魅惑を隠す箱 秘宝に香る危なげな
A box that hides fascination, a dangerous scent
in the treasure

singer, right?

318

ああん そんなにかっついちゃダメだゾ♡かな？
Ah, "Don't be so greedy♡", maybe?

319

ありがと、そうなんです今日誕生日なんです、はい。
Thank you, that's right, it's my birthday today, yes.

367
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:26,008
え？
Eh?

368
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:28,008
おい虚無を生むなよ。
Hey, don't create a void.

369
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:34,008
違う、なんか想定ではれをるからこう誕生日トークが来るはずだった。
No, like, I expected some birthday talk from Reol.

370
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:37,508
あ、なるほど。でもお誕生日については触れられなくないですか？
Oh, I see. But isn't it impossible not to mention the birthday?

371
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:39,508
え、なぜですか？触れてくださいよ全然。
Eh, why? Please mention it anytime.

372
00:28:39,508 --> 00:28:41,008
いくつになったんですか？
How old did you turn?

373
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:49,008
あ、そこですか？もちろん17歳5周、6周、5周、4周、どっちだ、5から6周の間です。
Oh, that? Of course, the 5th, 6th, 5th, 4th round of being 17... which one... it's between 5 and 6 rounds.

374
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:50,008
なるほど。
I see.

375
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:53,508
はい。あまり計算はしないで貰ったほうがいいので、一応ね。
Yes. It's better if you don't calculate it too much, just in case.

376
00:28:53,508 --> 00:28:57,508
この歌手の女とマリンはね、何年、どれぐらい、何年ぐらいですかね？
Between this female singer and Marine... how many years... how many years has it been?

377
00:28:58,008 --> 00:29:00,508
3年前ぐらい？3、4年前ぐらい？
About 3 years? About 3 or 4 years ago?

378
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:03,508
3、4年前ぐらいってことに。え、なに？あ、関係値？
So it's about 3 or 4 years ago. Eh, what? Oh, our relationship?

379
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:06,008
あ、関係値関係値。
Yeah, our relationship.

380
00:29:06,008 --> 00:29:12,508
関係値は、までもね、あの海賊のコスプレをなさり始めたぐらいからじゃないですか？
Relationship-wise, well, wasn't it around the time you started doing pirate cosplay?

381
00:29:12,508 --> 00:29:16,008
あ、そうです、海賊のコスプレをし始めたこともありましたが、
Ah, that's right, there was a time I started doing pirate cosplay, but...

382
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:19,008
ね、今やこんな大きな船に。
Right, and now on such a big ship.

383
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,008
ええ、そう、ま、これちょっと今日レンタル船というか。
Yeah, well, this is kind of a rental ship today.

384
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:22,508
リースなんだ。
It's a lease.

385
00:29:22,508 --> 00:29:25,008
基本自分の船持ってないので。夢を見せていけよ、おい。
I basically don't own my own ship. Let them dream, hey!

386
00:29:25,508 --> 00:29:29,508
誕生日ぐらい、誕生日ぐらい。あ、一応でも今日この船貰った設定なんで。
On my birthday... at least on my birthday. Oh, for today, the setting is that I received this ship.

387
00:29:29,508 --> 00:29:32,008
あ、ね、誕生日プレゼント。あ、素敵素敵。
Ah, I see, a birthday present. Oh, how lovely.

388
00:29:32,008 --> 00:29:34,508
ありがとうございます、そんな場所に呼んでいただいて。ありがとうございます。
Thank you for inviting me to such a place. Thank you very much.

389
00:29:34,508 --> 00:29:39,508
今日ね、この2曲歌ったんですけれど、ちょっとね、何歌うか一緒に色々考えて。
We sang these two songs today, but we thought about what to sing together.

390
00:29:39,508 --> 00:29:45,508
なんかマリンの持ち歌とれをるの持ち歌をそれぞれ歌いたいよねって話になり。
We talked about wanting to sing each of Marine's and Reol's original songs.

391
00:29:45,508 --> 00:29:51,508
で、マリ箱選んだのは、もう絶対れをるのこの歌手の女勢としての。
And the reason I chose "MariBako" was strictly from Reol's position as part of the female singers.

392
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:54,508
歌手の女ですぜとしての。
As someone from the female singers group.

393
00:29:54,508 --> 00:29:59,508
歌手の女勢。そう、この歌唱力を見せつけるには絶対にこれがいいと思って選んだんですが、結果超いいと。
Female singers group. Right, I chose this because I thought it was perfect to show off this vocal ability, and the result was great.

394
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:02,323
なんかマリンが処刑される羽目になっちゃった...
Somehow, Marine ended up being executed...

395
00:30:02,323 --> 00:30:03,423
いやいやいや、すごかった、素晴らしかった
No, no, no, it was amazing, it was wonderful.

396
00:30:03,723 --> 00:30:05,223
やっぱりこれ... あそこもうセクシー。ありがとう、
As expected... that part was so sexy. Thank you,

397
00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:07,623
ありがとうございます。セクシーにやっていただいて。ありがとうございます。
thank you so much. Thank you for doing it so sexily. Thank you.

398
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:13,123
でね、第六感をね、選ばせていただきましたが、
So, I chose 'Dairokkan',

399
00:30:13,123 --> 00:30:14,823
元々ね、あの、おちんと悩んだんだよね。
but originally, I was torn between that and 'Ochin'.

400
00:30:15,623 --> 00:30:18,823
そう、ギガンティックを歌ってほしいっていうオーダーを私はしたんですけど
Right, I actually requested for you to sing 'Gigantic',

401
00:30:19,923 --> 00:30:21,523
そう、Reolが歌ってほしいって言って、
Yeah, Reol said she wanted me to sing it,

402
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:24,523
やっぱりマリンはおちんですってふくらんじゃったやばおぴんこ...
and I thought, 'Marine is all about Ochin after all', and I got all excited...

403
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:27,023
おっと。歌うか、歌ってくれるのか...
Whoops. Are we singing? Are you going to sing for us...?

404
00:30:28,223 --> 00:30:31,423
って思ったけど、でもなんかやっぱり歌手の女のこの歌唱力全としたところを
I thought about it, but then I felt that to show off a female singer's

405
00:30:31,423 --> 00:30:34,423
見せるなら第六感かなーと思って
full vocal prowess, 'Dairokkan' would be better.

406
00:30:35,823 --> 00:30:37,923
そうですね、結局そっちになったんですね。ありがとうございます。
True, we ended up with that one. Thank you.

00:30:44,723 --> 00:30:48,823
一味っぽさっていうか、あの、まあ、あれ... 衣装、衣装ね。
Not exactly an Ichimi feel, but, well... the outfit, you know.

410
00:30:49,323 --> 00:30:53,523
マリン船長の部かっぽさ。青い、あの青いんですけど...
Like one of Captain Marine's subordinates. It's blue, though...

411
00:30:54,923 --> 00:30:57,523
あーじゃね、あーじゃねーよ。あのすいませんけど。
Not 'ah'! It's not 'ah'! Excuse me,

412
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:01,223
部かっぽさとか言って何も、何も部かっぽくないし。
but it doesn't look like a subordinate's outfit at all.

413
00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:03,023
青いし、青いです
And it's blue. Very blue.

414
00:31:03,423 --> 00:31:05,623
いやいや、ちょっと後でサイリウムを買います。赤、
No, no, I'll buy a glowstick later. Red,

415
00:31:05,623 --> 00:31:07,923
イメージカラー。赤ね。赤、赤、赤。すいません
the theme color. Red. Red, red, red. My apologies.

416
00:31:09,023 --> 00:31:10,423
まあまあまあ、でもね、すごい楽しかったですね。
Well, well, well, but anyway, it was really fun.

417
00:31:10,723 --> 00:31:12,223
いや楽しかった、ありがとうございました
Yeah, it was fun. Thank you very much.

418

貸してやろうか、このレンタル船をレンタルしてやろうか
Shall I lend it to you? Shall I let you rent this rental ship?

いいんですか、いいんですか
Is that okay? Really?

As a subordinate, of course. From a subordinate's perspective.

537
00:38:40,538 --> 00:38:43,038
やっぱキラキラ もっとクラクラ
As expected, sparkling, more dizzy

538
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:48,038
ドキ・ドキ・して Rouge? まだ早い♡
Does your heart throb, Rouge? It's still too early♡

539
00:38:48,338 --> 00:38:51,038
(無罪！無罪！美少女無罪！)
(Innocent! Innocent! Pretty girl innocent!)

540
00:38:51,338 --> 00:38:54,038
(マリン！マリン！マリンは無罪！)
(Marine! Marine! Marine is innocent!)

541
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:57,538
(やっぱキラキラ もっとクラクラ)
(As expected, sparkling, more dizzy)

542
00:38:57,738 --> 00:39:01,038
「マリン」じゃなくて… 「マリン船長」だるぉぉぉん！！
Not "Marine"... it's "Captain Marine" right!!?

543
00:39:23,038 --> 00:39:26,038
ピーマ様が来てくれましたー！ やったー！
P-ma-sama came to visit! Yay!

544
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:29,038
踊ってくれてありがとうございます！
Thank you so much for dancing with me!

545
00:39:29,538 --> 00:39:32,038
実はマリン、めちゃくちゃ好きなんですピーマ様が！
Actually Marine, I love P-ma-sama so much!

546
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:34,538
やったー！ (私も大好き！)
Yay! (I love you too!)

547
00:39:34,738 --> 00:39:37,538
(私も大好き！)
(I love you too!)

548
00:39:37,738 --> 00:39:40,038
いいの！？ テンションいいの！？
Is it okay!? Is this energy okay!?

549
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:43,038
ところでピーマ様、今日はね、マリンの誕生日なんです。
By the way P-ma-sama, today is Marine's birthday.

550
00:39:43,538 --> 00:39:45,538
あ、おめでとう！
Ah, happy birthday!

551
00:39:45,738 --> 00:39:47,738
17歳！ イエーイ！
17 years old! Yay!

552
00:39:48,038 --> 00:39:49,338
え、本当は何歳？
Wait, how old are you really?

553
00:39:49,538 --> 00:39:53,038
本当はー、ま、17から30の間を
In reality, well, somewhere between 17 and 30...

554
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:56,538
可変式にこう…行ったり来たりしてます。
I variably go back and forth like this.

555
00:39:57,038 --> 00:39:58,338
私も！
Me too!

556
00:39:58,538 --> 00:40:00,538
私もじゃないでしょｗ
Not 'me too' for you, right? lol

557
00:40:01,853 --> 00:40:03,903
おめでとう！ ありがとう！
Congratulations! Thank you!

558
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:06,503
ちょっとやっぱP丸様と歌うならと思ってね。
I thought, if I'm singing with P-maru-sama...

559
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:09,653
みんな大好きなシル・ヴ・プレジデント...言いにくい...
everyone's favorite "S'il Vous President"... it's hard to say...

560
00:40:09,653 --> 00:40:13,653
シル・ヴ・プレジデント歌わせてもらいました！マジ最高！
I got to sing "S'il Vous President"! It was the best!

561
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:17,353
うわー！わしも美ショパイ大好きだから、嬉しい！
Whoa! I love "Bisho-pai" too, so I'm happy!

562
00:40:17,353 --> 00:40:21,053
え、さっきのちょっとプチ裏話は話してもいいやつですか？
Um, is it okay to tell that little behind-the-scenes story from earlier?

563
00:40:21,053 --> 00:40:22,553
あ、全然いいよ！
Oh, totally fine!

564
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:27,253
なんとP丸様、なんと美ショパイ「歌ってみた」を出そうとしていたらしいです！
Turns out P-maru-sama was actually planning to release a "Bisho-pai" cover!

565
00:40:27,253 --> 00:40:31,053
そう！出そうかな？出そうかな？って思ってたけど...
Yeah! I was thinking "Should I? Should I?"...

566
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,953
何とも言え、今さら...
I don't know, it's kind of late now...

567
00:40:32,953 --> 00:40:35,853
ちょっと遅くないか？遅いけど、
Isn't it a bit late? It is late, but...

568
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:40,953
でも丁度歌おうと思ってた時にマリンがお声がけしたみたいで。
But right when she was thinking of singing it, I reached out to her.

569
00:40:40,953 --> 00:40:43,053
そう、ありがとうございます！
Yeah, thank you!

570
00:40:43,053 --> 00:40:44,753
こちらこそありがとうございます！
Thank you as well!

571
00:40:44,753 --> 00:40:49,353
あの、P丸様ってさ、いきなり呼び捨てみたいになってるけどこれ呼び方大丈夫そうですか？
Um, calling you "P-maru-sama" feels like I'm suddenly being too familiar, is this okay?

572
00:40:49,353 --> 00:40:53,053
いいよ、いいよ！あ、いいですか？じゃあ何て...何て呼びます？マリンのこと。
It's fine, it's fine! / Oh, really? Then how... how should I call you? Or how do you call me?

573
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:57,053
マリン...ちゃん？ マリンちゃん！これ初絡み、初絡み。
Marine...-chan? / Marine-chan! This is our first interaction, first interaction.

574
00:40:57,053 --> 00:40:59,753
そうなの、そうなの！
That's right, that's right!

575
00:40:59,753 --> 00:41:02,553
え、何でも、なんかP丸に、マリンでも。
Uh, anything like P-maru, or Marine.

576
00:41:02,553 --> 00:41:05,053
え、船長かな？ あ、船長、船長でいいですよ。
Maybe Senchou? / Ah, Senchou, Senchou is fine.

577
00:41:05,053 --> 00:41:07,953
P丸様って、でも普段「Pちゃん」とか呼ばれてますよね。
But P-maru-sama, you're usually called "P-chan" and stuff, right?

578
00:41:07,953 --> 00:41:13,153
呼ばれてるけど、まだちょっと、まだ仲良くないから、もうちょっと仲良くなりたい！
I am, but we're not... we're not that close yet, so I want to get closer first!

579
00:41:13,153 --> 00:41:17,353
待って待って、ズキズキ...え、こよりとかとね、コラボしてましたよね。
Wait, wait, that hurts... Uh, you've collaborated with Koyori and others, right?

580
00:41:17,353 --> 00:41:19,353
そう！ え、こよりのことは何て呼んでる？
Yeah! / What do you call Koyori?

581
00:41:19,353 --> 00:41:21,753
こよりちゃん。
Koyori-chan.

582
00:41:21,753 --> 00:41:26,353
こよりちゃん。え、仲いい？ え、仲いいと思ってるけど、こよりちゃんはどうかわかんない。
Koyori-chan. Are you close? / Well, I think we're close, but I don't know what Koyori-chan thinks.

583
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:32,453
あ、思ってる思ってる！こよりちゃん、ありがとう！
Oh, she does, she does! Koyori-chan, thank you!

584
00:41:32,453 --> 00:41:36,553
いきなりちょっと待って、よそ見しないで今マリンのことだけ見て。
Wait a second, don't look away, just look at me right now.

585
00:41:36,553 --> 00:41:37,853
あ、そうだった、そうだった。
Ah, right, right.

586
00:41:37,853 --> 00:41:39,653
でかい。 でかい？え、何が何が？
Big. / Big? What is?

587
00:41:39,653 --> 00:41:44,253
でかい！え、何これ、これこれこれ。
Big! What's this, this, this, this.

588
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:47,853
あ、ここね。あ、でもなんかこれくらいだよね。
Oh, here. But yours is about the same size, right?

589
00:41:47,853 --> 00:41:50,553
は？おい！こんな感じだよね。
What? Hey! / It's like this, right?

590
00:41:50,553 --> 00:41:56,253
いい、いい、ありがとう。こういうのがいいんだよ、結局なんだかんだね。
Fine, fine, thanks. This is what's good, after all.

591
00:41:56,253 --> 00:41:57,853
でかいし小さい。
Big and small.

592
00:41:57,853 --> 00:42:01,153
そうなの、小さいんです、意外と。
Yeah, I'm small, surprisingly.

593
00:42:01,153 --> 00:42:04,353
かわいい！Pちゃんもかわいい！
Cute! P-chan is cute too!

594
00:42:04,353 --> 00:42:07,653
ありがとう。え、こんな小さいんだ。
Thank you. Whoa, you're so small.

595
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:11,953
え、顔はでかいか。やめろ！顔はでかい！
Is my face big? / Stop it! My face is big!

596
00:42:11,953 --> 00:42:15,353
顔でかい、胸でかい、背小さい。
Face big, chest big, height small.

597
00:42:15,353 --> 00:42:19,753
顔...お前もでかいじゃねーか！
Face... yours is big too, isn't it?!

598
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:23,053
確かに！確かに！
True! True!

599
00:42:23,053 --> 00:42:26,053
よかった、同じくらいの顔のデカさだから、バランスいいな、バランスいい！
Good, we have about the same face size, so it's balanced! Balanced!

600
00:42:26,053 --> 00:42:29,753
また一緒に歌いたいな。
I want to sing with you again.

601
00:42:29,753 --> 00:42:31,453
わしも！また一緒に歌おう。
Me too! Let's sing together again.

602
00:42:31,453 --> 00:42:34,253
もっと仲良くなろうね、Pちゃん。
Let's get closer, P-chan.

603
00:42:34,253 --> 00:42:38,353
なりましょう、マリン先輩。ちょっと、距離が、距離がすごいある！
Let's, Marine-senpai. / Wait, that distance, there's a huge distance there!

604
00:42:38,353 --> 00:42:41,353
マリン先輩じゃなかった、Pちゃん。はい、Pちゃんね。
Not Marine-senpai, P-chan. / Yes, P-chan.

605
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:44,753
呼び捨てで、タメ口でいいので。 ありがとうございます！
You can drop the honorifics and speak casually. / Thank you very much!

606
00:42:44,753 --> 00:42:50,553
さあ、もうね、ライブも終盤となっておりますので、
Well, the live is already in its final stages, so...

607
00:42:50,553 --> 00:42:52,053
まだまだラストスパート盛り上がっていきたいと思います！
I want to keep the excitement going for the final spurt!

608
00:42:52,053 --> 00:42:54,953
それではいきましょう。出航！ ヨーソロー！
Here we go. Set sail! Yosoro!

609
00:42:54,953 --> 00:42:59,553
バイバーイ！ありがとうございます！
Bye-bye! Thank you very much!

610
00:42:59,553 --> 00:43:03,053
わー！だんだん消えていく、だんだん消えていく。
Whoa! She's slowly disappearing, slowly disappearing.

612
00:43:29,553 --> 00:43:32,953
ゴキゲンな蝶になって　きらめく風に乗って
I'll become a happy butterfly, and ride on the glittering wind

613
00:43:35,053 --> 00:43:38,453
今すぐ　キミに会いに行こう
I'll go to see you right now

614
00:43:41,053 --> 00:43:44,953
余計な事なんて　忘れた方がマシさ
It's better to forget about the unnecessary things

615
00:43:46,553 --> 00:43:49,953
これ以上　シャレてる時間はない
There's no more time to be stylish

616
00:43:52,553 --> 00:43:57,853
何が WOW WOW～　この空に届くのだろう
What will reach this sky? WOW WOW...

617
00:43:57,853 --> 00:44:03,753
だけど WOW WOW～　明日の予定もわからない
But WOW WOW... I don't even know tomorrow's plans

618
00:44:07,053 --> 00:44:13,253
無限大な夢のあとの　何もない世の中じゃ
In this world with nothing left after our infinite dreams

619
00:44:13,253 --> 00:44:18,953
そうさ愛しい　想いも負けそうになるけど
That's right, even my beloved feelings seem like they'll lose

620
00:44:18,953 --> 00:44:24,953
Stayしがちなイメージだらけの　頼りない翼でも
Even with these unreliable wings, full of images of staying still

621
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:31,553
きっと飛べるさ On My Love
I'm sure I can fly, On My Love

622
00:44:42,053 --> 00:44:47,353
ウカレタ蝶になって　一途な風に乗って
I'll become a cheerful butterfly, and ride on the single-minded wind

623
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:51,353
どこまでも　キミに会いに行こう
I'll go to see you anywhere

624
00:44:53,853 --> 00:44:59,353
曖昧な言葉って　意外に便利だって
Vague words are surprisingly convenient

625
00:44:59,353 --> 00:44:59,953
叫んでる...
shouting...

626
00:45:00,568 --> 00:45:05,068
踏んでるヒットソング聴きながら
While listening to the hit songs we're stepping to

627
00:45:05,668 --> 00:45:09,668
何が WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW この街に響くのだろう
What will "wow wow" through this city?

628
00:45:11,068 --> 00:45:15,168
だけど WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW 期待してても仕方ない
But "wow wow", it's no use having expectations.

629
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:24,068
無限大な夢のあとの 何もない世の中じゃ
In this empty world after an infinite dream,

630
00:45:26,368 --> 00:45:31,468
そうさ常識 はずれも悪くはないかな
Yeah, maybe being unconventional isn't so bad.

631
00:45:32,268 --> 00:45:35,468
Stayしそうなイメージを染めた
Dyed with an image that seems to stay,

632
00:45:35,468 --> 00:45:37,868
ぎこちない翼でも
even with these awkward wings.

633
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:43,068
きっと飛べるさ On my love
I'm sure I can fly, on my love.

Yeah, even my precious feelings seem like they'll lose,

Stayしがちなイメージだらけの
full of images that tend to stay,

637

638
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:45,568
きっと飛べるさ Oh yeah~
I'm sure I can fly, oh yeah~

639
00:46:47,868 --> 00:46:51,968
無限大な夢のあとの やるせない世の中じゃ
In this miserable world after an infinite dream,

640
00:46:54,168 --> 00:46:59,268
そうさ常識 はずれも悪くはないかな
Yeah, maybe being unconventional isn't so bad.

A continuing night voyage

657
00:50:13,913 --> 00:50:20,783
そこに雷が遺る 海賊の夢があるのなら
If there's a pirate's dream where lightning remains

658
00:50:20,883 --> 00:50:26,813
頂くしかないでしょ？
I'll have to take it, won't I?

00:51:12,843 --> 00:51:17,883
泡沫と共に沈め
Sink along with the bubbles

670
00:51:31,413 --> 00:51:34,013
黒い帆に隠れる
Hiding behind black sails

671
00:51:34,113 --> 00:51:37,913
極上の海賊の秘宝
The ultimate pirate treasure

672
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:43,083
掴んで笑う
Grab it and laugh

673
00:51:43,613 --> 00:51:49,813
満月の金銀珠玉 七つの海の宝玉に
The gold and silver jewels of the full moon,
to the gems of the seven seas

674
00:51:49,913 --> 00:51:54,783
「集まる虫ども」
“Gathering vermin”

675
00:51:54,913 --> 00:52:01,913
こぞり雷を狙う 愚か者に思い知らす
I'll teach those fools who all target the lightning

676
00:52:02,013 --> 00:52:06,913
相応しい持ち主を
Who the rightful owner is

677
00:52:07,013 --> 00:52:09,713
船に宿る 黒い魂の群れ
A host of black souls dwelling in the ship

678
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:12,813
影の底で忍び寄る絶望の渦
A vortex of despair creeping at the
bottom of the shadows

679
00:52:12,913 --> 00:52:18,983
まるで蓋の閉じた箱
Just like a box with its lid closed

680
00:52:19,113 --> 00:52:21,813
手放しちゃえば 諦めちゃえば
If you just let go, if you just give up

681
00:52:21,913 --> 00:52:25,713
悪夢の中から逃げられるのに また掴んでる
You could escape from the nightmare,
yet you're grasping again

682
00:52:25,813 --> 00:52:31,083
欲望が重いから
Because your desires are heavy

683
00:52:35,613 --> 00:52:38,813
「＊わたしのもの そうわたしのもの」
“*Mine, yes mine”

684
00:52:38,913 --> 00:52:42,713
自分自身を信じ込ませて縛って
Convincing and binding yourself

685
00:52:42,813 --> 00:52:47,743
縛り付けたてたって 気付いた
I realized I was tied down

686
00:52:47,813 --> 00:52:50,943
呪いの出口 永久の夜の海域
The exit to the curse, the waters of eternal night

687
00:52:50,943 --> 00:52:53,883
目を覚まして 貴方の悪夢から
Wake up from your nightmare

688
00:52:54,013 --> 00:53:01,913
連れ出す曳き船よ 出航して
Oh towboat that leads me out, set sail

689
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:05,883
私のもの まだ私のもの 深紅のバラ
Mine, still mine, the crimson rose

690
00:53:06,013 --> 00:53:09,743
朽ち果てたとしても
Even if it rots away

691
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:14,813
枯れない魂までは
Until the soul that never withers

692
00:53:14,913 --> 00:53:17,843
万の由珠 永遠の美貌
Countless jewels, eternal beauty

693
00:53:17,843 --> 00:53:21,713
そんな幻 どうだっていいでしょう
A phantom like that, who cares about it anyway?

694
00:53:21,813 --> 00:53:25,783
手放す決意はついたかい
Have you made the resolve to let go?

695
00:53:25,913 --> 00:53:35,083
さあ行こう 夜明けに舵を向けて
Now let's go, steer toward the dawn

696
00:53:35,613 --> 00:53:41,013
曰くを宿した船 希望だけ残して行く
The ship that harbored a curse, I leave
with only hope remaining

697
00:53:41,613 --> 00:53:51,913
他にはもういらないから
Because I don't need anything else anymore

698
00:53:59,643 --> 00:54:04,143

ほら、一緒に子育てするって約束したでしょ。
Look, you promised to raise a child with me, didn't you?

748
00:58:15,198 --> 00:58:22,898
よし、怖いね、怖いね。よしよし。あ、ほらほら、一緒に帰ろうね。一味ちゃんのところと一緒に帰ろうね。
There, it's okay, it's okay. There, there. Look, let's go home together. Back to the Ichimi's place together.
