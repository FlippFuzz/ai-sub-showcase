3
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Unison

4
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,800
片時も　大好きなのに　勘繰るわ
I'm in love with you every moment, yet I'm suspicious.

5
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,000
潜っただけ　淡いか　延命した
Just dove in, is it faint? I prolonged my life.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,400
可愛いわ　延命した
It's cute, I prolonged my life.

7
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,800
可愛いな
How cute.

8
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,000
波の上　拾いものも中毒さ
Even things picked up on the waves are addictive.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,200
広い空だのに奇妙な予感だ
Despite the wide sky, I have a strange premonition.

10
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,800
そうか　カンだ
I see, it was a hunch.

11
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,000
船長を決めてなかったんだ
We hadn't decided on a captain.

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,400
それがじゃんけん　先を急いだんだ
That was rock-paper-scissors, I was in a hurry.

13
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
視線今強引な
A forceful gaze now.

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
頬は紅潮で全員さ
Everyone's cheeks are flushed.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
他人に不用邸だ
I'm a useless manor to others.

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,600
口をしまい開錠だ
Shut your mouth, it's unlocked.

17
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,200
奪い合いなら解錠だ
If it's a scramble, then it's unlocked.

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
助けてすっかり遭難
Help, I'm completely shipwrecked.

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,000
みんな自分に入れるかどうか
Whether everyone will let me in.

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
というわけでサイレンス　気にしないんだ
So, silence, I don't care.

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,600
誰にしたって気にしない　最後の航海だ
I don't care who it is, it's the final voyage.

22
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,000
からきし笑い方
A completely hopeless way of laughing.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,200
さあ舵を取って交代だ
Now, take the helm and change shifts.

24
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,400
どうしてさ　見渡して
Why? Look around.

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,800
どうして　どうして
Why? Why?

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,200
比べるのが意味じゃない
Comparing is not the point.

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,800
いいな
It's nice.

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
みんな
Everyone.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
お願い、choose me
Please, choose me.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
お願い、choose me
Please, choose me.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,200
ほら　早く、今日中に
Look, hurry, by the end of today.

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,600
お願い、choose me
Please, choose me.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
君が今日選んでくれないと　なんもできない
If you don't choose me today, I can't do anything.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
考えてくれないと　心配に感じちゃうんだ
If you don't think about it, I'll start to feel worried.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,800
こんなとこで迷ってると　沈むよ、深海に
If you hesitate here, you'll sink into the deep sea.

36
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,800
沈むよ、深海に
You'll sink into the deep sea.

37
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,800
沈むよ、深海に
You'll sink into the deep sea.

38
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,800
沈むよ、深海に
You'll sink into the deep sea.

39
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,800
沈むよ、深海に
You'll sink into the deep sea.

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,800
沈むよ、深海に
You'll sink into the deep sea.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,600
濡れてきた　震える体　溢れてきちゃった
I've gotten wet, my shivering body, it's overflowing.

42
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,600
船底から穴が空いた　今
A hole has opened in the bottom of the ship, now.

43
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
座礁して　どうして
Running aground, why?

44
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,800
直せるのが君じゃない？
Why isn't it you who can fix it?

45
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
いいな
It's nice.

46
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
みんな
Everyone.

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
お願い、修理
Please, repair me.

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,600
お願い、修理
Please, repair me.

49
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:49,600
さあ、ほら今すぐに
Now, look, right now.

50
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,600
塞いで熱中して
Block it up and get absorbed.

51
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,200
熱中して！
Get absorbed!

52
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,000
熱中して！
Get absorbed!

53
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
君が今日塞いでくれないと　なんもできない
If you don't block it up today, I can't do anything.

54
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:00,808
信じてる
Believe...

55
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:01,808
そろそろ限界値
Almost at the limit

56
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:04,108
大事なもの探しに行かない？
Shall we go look for something important?

57
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:07,408
偉大な夢の旅、異世界に
A journey of grand dreams, in another world

58
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,508
君がいないと意味なんてない
Without you, it's meaningless

59
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,708
考えてくれないと心配に
I worry if you don't think about it

60
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:16,708
感じちゃうんだ こんなとこで
I start to feel it in a place like this

61
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:20,108
迷ってると行けないよ、絶対に
If you're lost, you'll never make it, for sure

62
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,508
行けないよ、絶対に
Never make it, for sure

63
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:46,008
マリン出航！！
Marine Shukkou!!

64
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:52,008
作詞：砂守岳央 作曲：田中公平
Lyrics: Sunamori Takeo, Composition: Tanaka Kohei

65
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,208
世界が壊れてゆく
The world is falling apart

66
00:05:58,308 --> 00:06:00,508
泣き声が聞こえていた
I could hear the crying voices

67
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:05,108
汚れた拳 痛むほど
Clenching my dirty fist so hard it hurt

68
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,408
強く握った
I held on tight

69
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,208
当たり前に笑ってた昨日はもうどこにもない
The yesterday where we laughed normally is nowhere to be found

70
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,108
明日がどんな日になるのか
No one knows what kind of day tomorrow will be

71
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:21,608
誰も知らない
No one knows

72
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,708
正義にさえ捨てられた今日
I swear to take back today

73
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:31,208
取り戻すことを
which was abandoned even by justice

74
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:34,908
誓う
I swear

75
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:38,908
錨上げ！
Anchor's aweigh!

76
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:42,108
勇気の旗上げて
Raise the flag of courage

77
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,308
旅立とう 嵐の海
And set sail into the stormy sea

78
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:49,108
立ち上がれ
Stand up

79
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:52,308
幸せは願えば
Happiness isn't cheap enough

80
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:57,608
手に入るほど安くはない
to get just by wishing

81
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:01,808
守るために戦うなら
If you're going to fight to protect

82
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:07,408
海賊に なればいい
Then just become a pirate

83
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,408
幸せ 簡単に
Happiness easily

84
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:40,208
掌の中消えてしまう
disappears from within one's palm

85
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,208
悲劇をただ見てることが
If you can't forgive just watching

86
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:47,608
許せないなら
the tragedy unfold

87
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:52,108
一人きりで震えていた昨日はもう消えはしない
The yesterday where you trembled alone will never disappear

88
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:57,108
それでも決意 胸に抱けば
But if you hold your determination in your heart

89
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,308
もう迷わない
You will no longer hesitate

90
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:05,108
道半ばで倒れた友に
Embracing the words entrusted

91
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:08,508
託された言葉
by friends who fell halfway

92
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:14,308
抱き
And hold them tight

93
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:18,208
錨上げ！
Anchor's aweigh!

94
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:21,408
自由の旗上げて
Raise the flag of freedom

95
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:26,008
突き進め 大海原
And push forward through the vast ocean

96
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:28,908
燃え上がれ
Blaze up

97
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:32,108
どんな雨だろうとも
Become a flame that never goes out

98
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:36,008
消えることなき 炎になれ
no matter what rain falls

99
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,208
錨上げ！
Anchor's aweigh!

100
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:41,408
勇気の旗上げて
Raise the flag of courage

101
00:08:41,508 --> 00:08:45,308
旅立とう 嵐の海
And set sail into the stormy sea

102
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:48,808
立ち上がれ
Stand up

103
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:51,908
幸せは願えば
Happiness isn't cheap enough

104
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:56,908
手に入るほど安くはない
to get just by wishing

105
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:01,508
守るために戦うなら
If you're going to fight to protect

106
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:06,508
海賊に なればいい
Then just become a pirate

恐れずにここで
Without fear, stand up here

114
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:33,208
夜明けの向こう側の果てに
at the end beyond the dawn

115
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:34,908
立ち上がれ
And stand tall

116
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,408

121
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:50,008
一人きりいつか
Alone someday, if we gather

122
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:53,608
集まればやがて
eventually a great pirate crew

123
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:57,608
偉大なる海賊団
A grand fleet of pirates

124
00:09:58,308 --> 00:09:59,808
錨上げ！
Anchor's aweigh!

125
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,016
出航！！
Set sail!!

126
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:18,016
はい、ということで、まず2曲聴いていただきました。
All right! So we just heard the first two songs.

127
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:23,016
はい、本日は何の日？そう、宝鐘マリンお誕生日です！
Yes! What day is it today? That's right! It's Houshou Marine's birthday!

128
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:29,016
はい、今日のハッシュタグは #宝鐘マリン生誕祭2022 まなんですけど、
Yes! Today's hashtag is #HoushouMarineBirthdayFest2022, but...

129
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:37,016
ま、今日はね、何といっても、ま、ここに書いてある通り、え、3Dのね、新衣装のお披露目もあります！
well, today, more than anything, as written here, we also have the 3D new costume reveal!

130
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:44,016
もうこれはね、隠しておくのは無理なんで先に言っちゃいます。でもう隠してることもひとつあるのよな。
It's impossible to keep it hidden anymore, so I'm just saying it now. And there's one more thing I'm hiding...

131
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:51,016
ちょっと隠してることも、え、終盤にね、お披露目したいと思いますので最後までしっかり見てください。
I'll reveal that hidden thing at the end, so please watch until the very end.

132
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:55,016
どんな衣装だと思う？超エッチです。毎回エッチです。
What kind of costume do you think it is? It's super sexy. It's always sexy.

133
00:10:55,016 --> 00:11:03,016
てなわけで何かね、今日はね、メッセージを何か頂いているというのを聞いているんですが、
So, I've heard that I've received some kind of message today...

134
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:13,016
なんかおやおや？あ！なんとね、あの、あの、あの…知ってますか君たち？あの…
Something's up? Oh! Surprisingly, that, that, that... do you guys know? That...

135
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:21,016
ほっこりモコモカちゃんからメッセージ頂いてるみたいです。知ってるよね？今日中、知らないなんてことはないよね？モグリだよそれは。
It seems I've received a message from Hokkori Mokomoka-chan. You know them, right? Everyone here, you couldn't possibly not know them, right? You'd be an outsider if you didn't.

136
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:25,016
あのね、すごく可愛いクマです。見ればわかる。ということで、じゃあメッセージお願いします！
They're a very cute bear. You'll see. So, please, the message!

137
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:30,016
マリン船長へ
To Captain Marine

138
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:31,016

モカがかざりつけをしたんだ〜

147
00:11:54,016 --> 00:12:00,016
いつもがんばっている　マリンせんちょうに　モコモカパワーをいっしょにおくろう！
Let's send the Mokomoka Power together to Captain Marine, who's always working hard!

148
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:07,016
じゅんびはいいかな？せーのっ　モコモカパワー！
Are you ready? One, two... Mokomoka Power!

149
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:07,016

Cute! It's wobbling, wobbling, so cute!

150
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:11,516
マリンせんちょうの　もとにすてきな　おくりものをしたよ
I've sent a wonderful gift to Captain Marine.

151
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:11,016
ああ頭のとんがりコーンが落ちそう。
Ah, the pointy cone on its head is about to fall off.

152
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:16,016
あのひ　モカとであってくれて　ありがとう
Thank you for meeting Moka that day.

153
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:24,016
これからもモカは　マリンせんちょうのそばにいるよ〜　まったね〜
From now on, Moka will always be by Captain Marine's side. See you later!

154
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:24,016
贈り物。ありがとうモコモカちゃん。可愛すぎ、可愛すぎ、可愛すぎる！
A gift. Thank you Mokomoka-chan. Too cute, too cute, way too cute!

155
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:37,016
うわ〜可愛い！船長も今初めて見たんですけど、可愛すぎる！え、有罪マジで可愛すぎる。
Whoa, cute! I'm seeing it for the first time too, and it's too cute! It's a crime, seriously too cute.

156
00:12:38,016 --> 00:12:46,016
じゃちょっと贈り物が来ているってことなんですけど…見て…見て…見て…行くよ〜！じゃ、じゃ、じゃ…これ君たち見える？見えないか。
So, a gift has arrived... let's see... let's see... let's see... Here we go! Now, now, now... can you guys see this? Maybe not.

157
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:59,016

158

159
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:24,016
Darling 目を開けて
Darling, open your eyes

160
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:27,016
この世の悪の巣窟で
In this world's nest of evil

161
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:31,016
吸い玉守る　心を頂戴
Give me your beautiful heart

162
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:34,016
逃げもできない
You can't even escape

163
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:37,016
幽閉の蒼白の王子よ
The pale prince of confinement

164
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:41,016
わたしが女神
I am the goddess

165
00:13:45,016 --> 00:13:47,016
バタフライの羽も
Even the butterfly's wings

166
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:49,516
わたしの抱擁も
And my embrace too

167
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:54,016
あなたをまだ見ぬ　極楽へ連れ出せはしない
Won't bring you to the unseen paradise

168
00:13:55,016 --> 00:13:57,016
腐りかけた自由
Decaying freedom

169
00:13:57,516 --> 00:13:59,016
紅にまみれた夢
Red-stained dreams

170
00:13:59,516 --> 00:14:02,016
煉獄の炎で　灼かれたら
If taken to the purgatory flames

171
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:04,516
再生しめしょう
Let me show you rebirth

172
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:07,016
冬の夜の空に
In the night sky

173
00:14:07,516 --> 00:14:09,516
色濃い彩
Darkly colored

174
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,516
落ちてゆくなら
Falling together

175
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:16,016
足掻けあり地獄
Struggle and resist

176
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:19,516
Darling 声上げて
Darling, raise your voice

177
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:22,516
このいま刺し違えるほど
To the point of stabbing each other

178
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:27,016
大事なものが欲しいのなら
If you want something precious

179
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:29,516
痛みは果てて
Pain will end

180
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:32,516
奈落で昇天の姫君
In the netherworld, the ascending princess

181
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:37,016
あなたは…
You are...

182
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:39,016
怒りの拳も
Even the fist of anger

183
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:40,516
嘆きの傷も
Even the wounds of grief

184
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:42,016
跡形もなく
Without a trace

185
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:46,016
熔けて消えて散って泡沫
Melting, disappearing, scattering like bubbles

186
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:57,516
すべては密やかに蒼く
Everything turns deeply blue

187
00:14:58,016 --> 00:15:00,016
埋もれた罠に
Buried in traps

188
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,324
ハバタケルノナラ...
If I could take flight...

189
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:05,124
粉々に砕いてほしいわ
I want you to crush me to pieces

190
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:07,724
地に堕たぬ病い
An illness that won't fall to the earth

191
00:15:07,724 --> 00:15:11,124
心臓にはポワゾン
A poison in the heart

192
00:15:11,124 --> 00:15:13,924
侵されながらも
While being invaded

193
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:15,824
一頻り祝福されたし
I have been blessed for a time

194
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:20,524
泣いたのは嗚咽、紅い砂丘
What cried was a sob, a red sand dune

195
00:15:20,524 --> 00:15:23,224
恋するのは墜とすため
Falling in love is for the sake of falling

196
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:26,824
毒を食みどのアマイ
Eating poison, which sweet...

197
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:30,324
あぁ Darling 抱きしめて
Oh Darling, hold me tight

198
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:33,724
素肌の絹の光沢で
With the luster of the silk of bare skin

199
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:38,224
恍惚しちゃう時間を頂戴
Give me time to be entranced

200
00:15:38,224 --> 00:15:40,824
あぁ 身体は避けて
Ah, avoid the body

201
00:15:40,824 --> 00:15:43,724
天国での再会の片割れ
The counterpart of a reunion in heaven

202
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:48,324
あぁ ふたりは迷子
Ah, the two are lost

203
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:51,024
至極の善と魅惑の奈落
The ultimate good and the enchanting abyss

204
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:53,624
約束の地は何処か其処か
Where is the promised land, here or there?

205
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:57,024
夢か現か
Is it a dream or reality?

206
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:18,024
さぁ 疾く 此処 揺らして
Now, quickly, shake here

207
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:23,024
全貌を迎えましょう
Let us welcome the whole picture

208
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:30,024
あぁ Darling 目を開けて
Oh Darling, open your eyes

209
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:33,224
この世の悪の毒窟も 蝕めない
Even the poisonous den of this world's evil cannot erode it

210
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:35,824
心を頂戴
Give me your heart

211
00:16:35,824 --> 00:16:38,524
卑下もしない
I won't even humble myself

212
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:43,224
幽閉の蒼白の王子よ 私が女神
O imprisoned pale prince, I am the goddess

213
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:49,024
あぁ Darling 声上げて
Oh Darling, raise your voice

214
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:52,024
このいま刺し違えるほど
So much so that we stab each other right now

215
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:56,824
大事なものが欲しいのなら
If you want something important

216
00:16:57,024 --> 00:16:59,024
祈りは果てて
Prayers have ended

217
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:02,024
牢獄で昇天の姫君
O princess ascending in prison

218
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:06,024
あなたが王
You are the king

219
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:11,024
組まれた指と懺悔の首と
With clasped fingers and a repentant neck

220
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:13,524
購う罪は何れか其れか
Which sin is the one to be atoned for?

221
00:17:13,524 --> 00:17:17,024
嘘か真か
Is it a lie or the truth?

222
00:17:34,824 --> 00:17:36,524
アキロゼ先輩〜！
Akirose-senpai~!

223
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:37,524
よいしょ〜！
Yoisho~!

224
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,024
はあ〜！
Haa~!

225
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:42,524
一緒に歌うの、これ初めてじゃないですか？
Isn't this the first time we've sung together?

226
00:17:42,524 --> 00:17:44,224
そうだね！何でさ、この曲選んでくれたん？
That's right! Why did you choose this song?

227
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:48,524
船長の中では、アキロゼ先輩といえば、もうALI PROJECTのイメージなんですよ！
In my mind, Akirose-senpai definitely has an ALI PROJECT image!

228
00:17:48,524 --> 00:17:50,024
あ、そうなんだ！嬉しいな〜！
Oh, is that so! I'm so happy~!

229
00:17:50,024 --> 00:17:52,024
逆に、逆にアキロゼ先輩は...
Conversely, Akirose-senpai...

230
00:17:52,024 --> 00:17:53,524
いいよいいよ、いいリズムだね (笑)
It's fine, it's a good rhythm (laughs)

231
00:17:53,524 --> 00:17:57,024
アキロゼ先輩は、船長と歌うなら、何がいいと思いますか？
Akirose-senpai, if you were to sing with me, what would you like?

232
00:17:57,024 --> 00:18:02,024
マリンちゃんのあの、昭和歌謡とか、めちゃ好きだからな〜。
Since I really like Marin-chan's Showa-era pop songs and stuff.

233
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:05,524
あ〜！ちょっと昭和系の歌歌いたいんだよね！
Ah! I do want to sing some Showa-style songs!

234
00:18:05,524 --> 00:18:07,524
めちゃめちゃいいじゃないですか！
That sounds great!

235
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:09,524
あの、キャンディーズとか。
Like Candies.

236
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:12,524
お、年下の男の子！？
Oh, Toshishita no Otokoko!?

237
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,224
真っ赤なリンゴ、頬ばるリンゴ...
A bright red apple, an apple to munch on...

238
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:18,524
めっちゃいい！じゃあ次は絶対、「年下の男の子」一緒に歌いましょうね！
That's great! Then next time, let's definitely sing 'Toshishita no Otokoko' together!

239
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:20,524
いいね！じゃあ次は「年下の男の子」で会いましょう！
Sounds good! Then let's meet next time with 'Toshishita no Otokoko'!

240
00:18:20,524 --> 00:18:22,524
じゃーねー！
See ya!

241
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:24,524
おめでとねー！
Congratulations!

242
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:42,524
建前だけの感情論で
With an emotional theory that's just a facade

243
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:45,324
全てを量ろうなんて
Trying to measure everything

244
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,824
そんなのはお門違い、笑わせないでよね
That's totally wrong, don't make me laugh

245
00:18:48,824 --> 00:18:52,324
だけどたまには楽しいことも
But sometimes, even fun things

246
00:18:52,324 --> 00:18:55,324
必要だと思いの
I think are necessary

247
00:18:55,324 --> 00:18:59,524
気が済むまで私も、満足したいわ
Until I'm satisfied, I want to be fulfilled too

248
00:18:59,524 --> 00:19:02,324
あぁ 目の前から消えていった
Ah, it disappeared from before my eyes

249
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:05,324
心を刺す嘘みたいに
Like a lie that stabs the heart

250
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:09,324
ぐるぐるって混ざるような、この感じがたまらない
This feeling of swirling and mixing is irresistible

251
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:12,324
ねぇ ぶっ飛んじゃうのが良いなら
Hey, if getting blown away is fine

252
00:19:12,324 --> 00:19:14,324
私をもっと本気にさせて
Then make me more serious

253
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:17,024
逃げるなんて許さないわ
I won't forgive you for running away

254
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:20,524
やっぱりそんな態度なのね
Just as I thought, that's your attitude

255
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:20,524
やっぱりそんな態度なのかしら
I wonder if that's really your attitude

256
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:33,324
甘いのもいいと思うけれど
I think sweet things are good too, but

257
00:19:33,324 --> 00:19:35,324
苦いのも嫌いじゃない
I don't dislike bitter things either

258
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:39,324
そんな私のことを、わがままだと言うの？
Are you calling me selfish for that?

259
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:42,324
馬鹿だとかアホらしいとか
Like being a fool or being ridiculous

260
00:19:42,324 --> 00:19:44,324
言いたいだけ言えばいいわ
Just say whatever you want

261
00:19:44,324 --> 00:19:48,824
他人の価値観なんて、私は知らないの
I don't know anything about other people's values

262
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:52,324
あぁ 掌から落ちていった
Ah, it fell from the palm of my hand

263
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,324
紫色の花みたいに
Like a purple flower

264
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:59,524
くるくるって踊るような、この感じがたまらない
This feeling of dancing round and round is irresistible

265
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:01,352
さあ、どうなっちゃうのか
Well, what will happen?

266
00:20:01,352 --> 00:20:02,352
見せてよ
Show me...

267
00:20:02,352 --> 00:20:03,232
本能
your instinct.

268
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:05,132
どちらが勝つの？
Which one will win?

269
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:06,352
理性と超絶【自主規制】で
Reason or transcendent [Self-Censorship]

270
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:07,432
魅せてよ
fascinate me.

271
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:09,932
本当はここを欲しがるくせに
Even though you actually want this place.

272
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:32,432
嬉しいとか 気持ちいいとか
Whether it's "happy" or "feels good",

273
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,932
所詮それは自己満足
it's ultimately just self-satisfaction.

274
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:42,532
戯言を並べ立てて
Lining up nonsensical words...

275
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,932
投げ捨てちゃっていいんじゃない？
Wouldn't it be okay to just throw them away?

276
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:49,832
思わせて
Make me think so.

277
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,232
もうぶっ飛んじゃったら良いでしょ
It's fine if you just lose your mind already.

278
00:20:52,232 --> 00:20:54,632
一体どこに不満があるの？
Where on earth is the dissatisfaction?

279
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:57,132
いっそうそうなったら逃がさない
If it comes to that, I won't let you get away.

280
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:59,632
だからね、ほらね、覚悟して
So, you see, prepare yourself.

281
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:01,832
さあ、どうなっちゃってもいいから
Now, I don't care what happens,

282
00:21:01,832 --> 00:21:04,332
その目で最後まで見届けて
so watch until the end with those eyes.

283
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:07,132
どこまで行っても止まらない
No matter how far we go, we won't stop.

284
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,632
だけどね、でもね、そろそろ限界
But, you see, it's almost the limit.

285
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,132
ああもうだめ
Ah, no more.

286
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:21,032
あああああああ
Ahhhhhhhhh

287
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:46,532
おお〜〜〜！
Ooooh~~~!

288
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:50,532
いや、鷹嶺ルイにこの歌はもう本当にぴったりだと思ったんですが
No, I thought this song was a perfect fit for Takane Lui, but...

289
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:52,632
ガチでぴったりだったわ。
it seriously was a perfect fit.

290
00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:54,432
え、嬉しい嬉しい。
Eh, I'm happy, I'm happy.

291
00:21:54,432 --> 00:21:57,832
いや、でもマリン先輩もめちゃくちゃセクシーで素晴らしかったです。
No, but Marine-senpai was also incredibly sexy and wonderful.

292
00:21:57,832 --> 00:22:02,532
いや、セクシーといえば船長、いや、もう本当にエロ女上司としての立場が
No, speaking of sexy, Senchou... No, really, as a sexy adult woman boss,

293
00:22:02,532 --> 00:22:04,732
危ぶまれてるの、こっち。
my position is being threatened here.

294
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:06,932
鷹嶺ルイに今、処刑されてる。
I'm being executed by Takane Lui right now.

295
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:08,432
やだ！
No way!

296
00:22:08,432 --> 00:22:09,832
私セクシーだからなぁ。
Well, I am sexy, after all.

297
00:22:09,832 --> 00:22:11,832
やだ何これスタイル良すぎる！
No, look at this! Your figure is too good!

298
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:14,332
これじゃマリンがロリータに見えちゃう！
This makes Marine look like a lolita!

299
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:17,032
いやマリン先輩、元々ロリですからね。
Well Marine-senpai, you were a loli to begin with.

300
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:18,532
え！？
Eh!?

301
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:20,532
ロリババアっていう感じで。
Like a "Loli-Babaa" kind of vibe.

302
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:24,132
マリン。
Marine.

303
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:27,432
俺だけのババアになれよ。
Become my "Babaa" alone.

304
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:28,932
おばあちゃんなる...。
I'll become your grandma...

305
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:32,432
ルイちゃん、メガドライブ買ってあげるね。
Lui-chan, I'll buy you a Mega Drive, okay?

306
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:34,532
いや、メガドライブはちょっと古い...。
No, Mega Drive is a bit old...

307
00:22:40,432 --> 00:22:44,232
止まらない未来を目指して
Aiming for a future that won't stop,

308
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:49,032
譲れない願いを抱きしめて
embracing a wish that cannot be yielded.

309
00:22:49,032 --> 00:23:04,532
あああああああああ
Ahhhhhhhhhhh

310
00:23:06,132 --> 00:23:07,932
ゆずれない願い
Unbreakable Wish

311
00:23:12,132 --> 00:23:14,832
海の色が赤く染まってゆく
The color of the sea is being dyed red,

312
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:18,832
無重力状態
a state of zero gravity.

313
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:21,832
このまま風にさらわれたい
I want to be swept away by the wind just like this.

314
00:23:24,732 --> 00:23:28,132
いつも飛べないハードルを
The hurdles I can never jump over,

315
00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:32,132
負けない気持ちでクリアしてきたけど
I've cleared them with a spirit that won't give up.

316
00:23:33,832 --> 00:23:37,432
出しきれない実力は
The potential I can't fully bring out,

317
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:41,232
誰のせい？
whose fault is it?

318
00:23:41,232 --> 00:23:45,232
止まらない未来を目指して
Aiming for a future that won't stop,

319
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,032
譲れない願いを抱きしめて
embracing a wish that cannot be yielded.

320
00:23:50,432 --> 00:23:54,032
色褪せない心の地図
The map of my heart that won't fade,

321
00:23:54,032 --> 00:24:03,532
光にかざそう
let's hold it up to the light.

322
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:13,832
どれだけ投げれば朝に出会えるの？
How much must I cry out to meet the morning?

323
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:17,032
孤独な夜
A lonely night.

324
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:21,032
初めて限界を感じた日
The day I felt my limit for the first time.

325
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:26,032
きっと恋に落ちるのは
Surely, falling in love is

326
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:30,032
瞬きみたいな一瞬の情熱だけど
an instantaneous passion like a blink, but...

327
00:24:31,732 --> 00:24:35,332
愛に続く坂道で
On the slope leading to love,

328
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:39,132
強さを覚えたい
I want to learn strength.

329
00:24:39,132 --> 00:24:43,032
止まらない未来を目指して
Aiming for a future that won't stop,

330
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:47,832
夢見て
dreaming.

331
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:51,632
口を閉ざし 瞳を輝かせて
Closing my mouth, making my eyes sparkle,

332
00:24:51,632 --> 00:24:55,232
駆け抜ければ もっと大きな
if I run through, a much bigger...

333
00:24:55,232 --> 00:25:00,032
優しさに出会える
kindness I will meet.

334
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,540
見えたー！
I saw it!

335
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:44,140
はーい、ということで
Hi, so...

336
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,740
やーも、そらあずというね、この、ほら、主人公的な
Well, with SoraAz, you know, these main-character-like

337
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,740
二人を添えて、バリバリの主題歌歌ってみたかったんですよ！
two by my side, I really wanted to sing a full-on theme song!

338
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,940
めっちゃ楽しかったー！
It was so much fun!

339
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,740
ありがとうございましたー！
Thank you so much!

340
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,840
でもなんか、やっぱ二人に挟まれると、船長完全に敵
But somehow, being sandwiched between you two, I feel like a total enemy...

341
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,940
敵なのよ
I'm an enemy.

342
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,240
え、敵じゃないよ？
Eh, not an enemy?

343
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,040
ええー？
What?

344
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,340
なんか敵キャラっぽくない？
Don't I look like an enemy character?

345
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,040
ええー？
Eh?

346
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,740
なんかー
Somehow...

347
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,240
敵ってことは、じゃあ...
If I'm an enemy, then...

348
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,040
敵だね
I'm an enemy.

349
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,140
敵だね
Enemy, then.

350
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,940
え、どこから出したの？
Wait, where did you get those from?

351
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,640
ちょっと、あの、二人とも戦わないで！
Wait, don't fight, you two!

352
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,040
二人とも戦わないで！待って待って待って！
Don't fight! Wait, wait, wait!

353
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:40,040
うーうーうー　ららら
Ooh ooh ooh, la la la

354
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,040
ちょっとそこのお嬢さん、愛を買ってみませんか
Hey there, young lady, won't you try buying some love?

355
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,940
月夜に巡り逢った、この縁に
To this fate of meeting on a moonlit night

356
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,340
流し目の瞳、月光照らす金の髪
Sidelong glances, golden hair lit by moonlight

357
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,540
今宵の誰よりも輝いております
You are shining brighter than anyone else tonight

358
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,540
夜な夜な現る、宵闇の怪異の恐怖が
If the fear of the twilight monster that appears night after night

359
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,740
もしもあなたを脅かすならば
should happen to threaten you

360
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,440
さもありながら私、愛の語らいついでに
Then while we're talking of love,

361
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,740
あなたの行く先へお供いたしましょう
I shall accompany you to your destination

362
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,940
嗚呼、嬉しいわ
Ah, I'm so happy

363
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:44,240
今宵のお相手は貴方？
Are you my partner tonight?

364
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,740
ねぇ、過ごしましょう
Hey, let's spend it together

365
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:53,640
蠱惑的で幻想的な一夜を
An enchanting and fantastical night

366
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,540
出会いは
The encounter

367
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,840
唐突ながら
was sudden

368
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,540
月明かり
Under the moonlight

369
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,540
の下、惹かれ行く
being drawn in

370
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,440
月夜に飢える
Hungering for the moonlit night

371
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,140
昏い眼をした
With dark eyes

372
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,840
狼の気配は
The presence of a wolf

373
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,940
押し付け
Imposing

374
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,940
がましの愛は
false love

375
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,040
今宵も
Tonight as well

376
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,040
向かう先を探す
searching for where to go

377
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,540
その仮面
Under that mask

378
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,540
の下に気付かれる
being noticed

379
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,540
ことも無いままに
without even being noticed

380
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,840
今宵も
Tonight as well

381
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,440
獲物を求め
seeking prey

382
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:46,440
冷めぬ夜更けに、外歩くあなた
You, walking outside in the dead of night

383
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,540
そもそもどちらへ、おいででしたか
Where were you going in the first place?

384
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,640
どうぞお気になさらずに、レディの秘密を
Please don't mind me, to uncover a lady's secret

385
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,340
暴くのはあなたに、あるまじき行い
is an improper thing for you to do

386
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,040
では無くって？
Is it not?

387
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:08,398
透き通る夜こそ 気をつけなければならないさ
夜な夜な現れる シリアルキラーに
In the clear night, you must be careful.
Night after night, the serial killer appears.

388
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:16,898
月の照らす静寂に 騒ぎ立てる者こそ
霧へと消えれば 夜忍ぶはなくて
In the moonlit silence, those who make a fuss
disappear into the mist, and the night hides nothing.

389
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:25,598
ああ、イケないよ 殺人鬼を悪戯に
駆り立てる言葉
Ah, it's no good. Words that mischievously
drive the killer.

390
00:30:25,898 --> 00:30:34,298
ねえ、怯え惑う者にこそ
殺人鬼は現れるそうよ
Hey, it seems the killer appears specifically
to those who are trembling in confusion.

391
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:43,098
出会いは唐突ながら
月明かりの下 惹かれゆく
The encounter is sudden,
but under the moonlight, we are drawn together.

392
00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:51,898
月夜に飢える 昏い瞳をした
狼の気配は 深まる夜のしじまに
Starving for the moonlit night, with dark eyes,
the presence of the wolf deepens in the silence of the night.

393
00:30:52,198 --> 00:31:00,898
霧満ちる 都市の灯の中で
男と女は踊る
In the mist-filled city lights,
man and woman dance,

394
00:31:01,098 --> 00:31:13,598
互いに狙いを定めて
今宵も獲物はそこに
aiming at each other.
Tonight too, the prey is there.

395
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:50,898
ああ、人影も途絶えた
暗い独り言に 絶望
Ah, where no one else is near.
Despair in a dark monologue.

396
00:31:51,198 --> 00:31:59,598
月を背に 殺人鬼は牙を剥いた
With the moon at their back, the killer bared their fangs.

397
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:08,598
出会いも唐突ならば
別れも切な 刹那の出来事
If the encounter is sudden,
then the parting is also a sad, momentary event.

398
00:32:08,898 --> 00:32:17,398
月夜に嗤う 紅い瞳をした
狼の姿は
Sneering in the moonlit night, with red eyes,
the wolf's figure is

399
00:32:17,598 --> 00:32:25,898
月を映すナイフを手に
佇むシリアルキラー
standing still with a knife reflecting the moon,
a serial killer.

400
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:34,598
決して満たされることは無く
やがては再び彷徨う
Never being satisfied,
eventually wandering again.

401
00:32:34,898 --> 00:32:39,098
今宵も獲物は何処に
Tonight too, where is the prey?

402
00:33:07,573 --> 00:33:09,598
よっしゃー！沙花叉に勝った！
Yesss! I beat Sakamata!

403
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:13,098
ねえ！勝ってないでしょ！
Hey! You didn't win!

404
00:33:14,073 --> 00:33:17,098
いや、船長はね、沙花叉を殺すのが夢だったんだ。
Well, it was the Captain's dream to kill Sakamata.

405
00:33:17,273 --> 00:33:19,598
ねえ、ひどい！掃除屋なのに！
Hey, that's mean! Even though I'm a cleaner!

406
00:33:19,773 --> 00:33:21,098
掃除しちゃいました。
I cleaned you up.

407
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:22,598
掃除されたんですけど。
I got cleaned, though.

408
00:33:22,673 --> 00:33:26,598
いやー、この曲ね、実は東方のボーカルアレンジの曲なんだけど。
Wow, this song is actually a Touhou vocal arrangement.

409
00:33:26,773 --> 00:33:29,598
もう、マジで歌詞が沙花叉にぴったりなの。
The lyrics really fit Sakamata perfectly.

410
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:32,098
いやー、ほんと、銀髪とかね。
Yeah, truly, with the silver hair and all.

411
00:33:32,173 --> 00:33:33,598
そうそう、シリアルキラーとかね。
Exactly, and 'serial killer'.

412
00:33:33,673 --> 00:33:36,098
そうそうそう、だから沙花叉が勝つと思ったのに！
Right, right, so I thought Sakamata would win!

413
00:33:36,273 --> 00:33:37,598
ちょっと勝ってみた。
I tried winning for a bit.

414
00:33:37,773 --> 00:33:40,098
ねえ、やだー！でも、めっちゃ良かったです！
Hey, no way! But it was really great!

415
00:33:40,273 --> 00:33:41,098
めっちゃ良かった。
It was really good.

416
00:33:41,273 --> 00:33:44,098
いやー、次こそ絶対マリン先輩に勝ちますからね！
Man, next time I'll definitely beat you, Marine-senpai!

417
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,598
船長の勝ち！勝ち勝ち勝ち勝ち！
Captain's victory! Win win win win!

418
00:33:46,773 --> 00:33:48,098
船長の勝ちじゃない！
It's not Captain's victory!

419
00:33:51,273 --> 00:33:54,098
沙花叉の勝ちー！
Sakamata wins!

420
00:34:18,198 --> 00:34:22,598
胸のピストル鳴らして 焼けに鼓動が邪魔する
Firing the pistol in my chest, my heartbeat is terribly bothersome.

421
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:27,598
落ち着いてられないそんな情熱
Such passion that I can't stay calm.

422
00:34:28,598 --> 00:34:33,598
解きかけの熱い方程式 次の扉を開いて
A half-solved hot equation, opening the next door.

423
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:38,598
いけない憧れ時があるよね
There are times when there's a forbidden longing, right?

424
00:34:39,598 --> 00:34:48,598
譲れないその想いに 君が輝くから
Because you shine in that feeling that can't be surrendered.

425
00:34:49,598 --> 00:34:58,598
くじけそうな 今日も平気 成功への 助走は前へ
Even on days when I'm about to give up, I'm okay.
The run-up to success is forward.

426
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:05,787
Sparking Now! 強くタフなハート
Sparking Now! A strong and tough heart

427
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:11,887
磨いたら世界は見違える
Once polished, the world will look completely different

428
00:35:12,787 --> 00:35:17,387
Sparking Now! 高くかざしたソウル
Sparking Now! A soul held high

429
00:35:18,187 --> 00:35:25,087
力の限り 目指せ1000%
With all your might, aim for 1000%

430
00:35:37,087 --> 00:35:41,087
もっとずっと遠い場所だと思っていた。手の届かない夢物語。
I thought it was a much more distant place. An unreachable fairy tale.

431
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:45,087
待て！ねえ待て、父さんでしょ！
Wait! Wait, you're my father, aren't you?!

432
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:52,587
どんな小さな光も見逃さずにいた。少しでもあなたに近づくために。
I never let even the smallest light escape my sight. All to get even a little closer to you.

433
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:56,587
この命、たとえ失ってもお守りいたします。
Even if I were to lose this life, I shall protect you.

434
00:35:58,487 --> 00:36:03,587
闇を切り裂く胸の奥の勇気、迷いを断ち切り白い翼。
The courage deep within my chest that slices through the darkness, white wings that cut through hesitation.

435
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,587
もう一人で何でもできるって思うんじゃないわよ！
Don't think you can do everything on your own anymore!

436
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:13,587
立ち止まりそうになっても、今ここにある笑顔、胸に閉じ込めて。
Even if I'm about to stop, I'll keep the smile that's here now locked in my heart.

437
00:36:14,387 --> 00:36:18,087
守られてるばっかりは嫌やわ。うちも守りたい！
I'm tired of always being protected. I want to protect too!

438
00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:25,087
Burning Heart! 熱く燃やすよ今。
Burning Heart! I'll burn it hot now.

439
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:30,287
手探りの世界を突き抜けて。
Breaking through this fumbling world.

440
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:35,887
Burning Heart! 闇を照らしたのは、
Burning Heart! What lit up the darkness was,

441
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:43,087
自分自身の光る 1000%
My own shining 1000%.

442
00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:19,487
Sparking Now! 強くタフなハート
Sparking Now! A strong and tough heart

443
00:37:20,287 --> 00:37:25,587
磨いたら世界は見違える
Once polished, the world will look completely different

444
00:37:26,387 --> 00:37:30,887
Sparking Now! 高くかざしたソウル
Sparking Now! A soul held high

445
00:37:31,587 --> 00:37:38,287
力の限り 目指せ 1000%
With all your might, aim for 1000%

446
00:37:38,887 --> 00:37:43,587
Burning Heart! 熱く燃やすよ今。
Burning Heart! I'll burn it hot now.

447
00:37:44,287 --> 00:37:49,087
手探りの世界を突き抜けて。
Breaking through this fumbling world.

448
00:37:49,787 --> 00:37:54,587
Burning Heart! 闇を照らしたのは、
Burning Heart! What lit up the darkness was,

449

自分自身の光る 1000%
My own shining 1000%.

450
00:38:22,087 --> 00:38:25,587

Ah~! Suichan~!

451
00:38:25,587 --> 00:38:29,387
すいちゃんと初めて一緒に歌った～！
I sang together with Suichan for the first time~!

452
00:38:29,387 --> 00:38:30,387
嘘だよ！
No way!

453
00:38:30,387 --> 00:38:34,587
いや、今まではね、こう混ざり合っての一緒はあったけど、
Well, up until now, we've sung together in groups,

454
00:38:34,587 --> 00:38:35,587
二人きりでは初めてで。
but this is the first time just the two of us.

455
00:38:35,587 --> 00:38:36,587
初めて。
First time.

456
00:38:36,587 --> 00:38:39,587
え、どう？なんか結構バランスいいんじゃない？
So, how was it? Don't you think the balance was pretty good?

457
00:38:39,587 --> 00:38:41,087
このさ、あ、何？何？
This, like... Oh, what? What?

458
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:42,587
なんかバランス、色のバランスの話ね。
Like the balance, talking about the color balance.

459
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:43,887
何が言いたかったかな～？
What was I trying to say~?

460
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:46,587
え、なんかほら、赤と青でほら、なんかいい感じ...
Like, look, red and blue, it feels like a nice...

461
00:38:46,587 --> 00:38:48,587
なんかちんちくりんだな。
It's kind of puny.

462
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:50,087
ちょっと待って。
Hold on a second.

463
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:52,587
なんかすいちゃんの隣に立つとなんか、え、マリン、なんか、
Whenever I stand next to Suichan, Marine, like...

464
00:38:52,587 --> 00:38:53,887
なんだろう、あの、ピクミンみたいだよね。
how do I put it, I look like a Pikmin, right?

465
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:54,887
赤ピクミン？
Red Pikmin?

466
00:38:54,887 --> 00:38:56,587
え、キャプテン・オリマーの方？赤ピクミンの方？
Wait, the Captain Olimar one? Or the Red Pikmin one?

467
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:58,087
赤ピクミンの方。あ、キャプテン・オリマーじゃない？
The Red Pikmin one. Wait, not Captain Olimar?

468
00:38:58,087 --> 00:38:59,087
赤ピクミンの方。
The Red Pikmin one.

469
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,087
キャプテン・オリマーじゃない。
Not Captain Olimar.

470
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,387
いや、すいちゃん...
Come on, Suichan...

471
00:39:01,387 --> 00:39:04,587
やめ、そんな話して尺使わないで。
Stop, don't use up the time talking about that.

はい、はい、はい。
Okay, okay, okay.

Today, we sang this song Suichan chose, "1000%SPARKING!".

An old anime song. It's from Negima. Did you know?

476
00:39:13,587 --> 00:39:14,587
もちろん知ってるよ。
Of course I know.

477
00:39:14,587 --> 00:39:17,587
そうだよね。一緒に歌えて本当に嬉しかった。ありがとう。

ありがとう。
Thank you.

479
00:39:18,587 --> 00:39:20,587
なんかすごかったよね、ネギまあれ。
That Negima arrangement was amazing, wasn't it?

480
00:39:20,587 --> 00:39:21,887
本当に。めっちゃ高かったし。
Truly. It was super high-pitched too.

481
00:39:21,887 --> 00:39:23,587
すいちゃん、踊りも本当にお疲れ様。
Suichan, thanks for the hard work on the dancing too.

582
00:45:40,472 --> 00:45:43,772

Open the primary

715
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,580
Oh I whisper

716
00:55:08,288 --> 00:55:11,888
いなごも黙る　なりのサスペンス
A suspense that would even silence locusts

717
00:55:12,088 --> 00:55:15,588
君たちも　もう我慢できないっすな
You guys can't hold back anymore, can you?

718
00:55:16,388 --> 00:55:19,488
野暮な女言わせちゃ　Maybe dance for me
Don't make me say it, maybe dance for me

719
00:55:19,688 --> 00:55:24,088
私のすべてを　手に入れて
Take all of me

720
00:55:28,488 --> 00:55:30,388
ぴたっ　止まる
Suddenly, I stop

721
00:55:32,488 --> 00:55:34,288
ハッとするでしょ
It catches you off guard, doesn't it?

722
00:55:36,488 --> 00:55:38,288
ぱっと目が合う
Our eyes meet in a flash

723
00:55:40,488 --> 00:55:42,288
誰か助けて
Someone, help me

724
00:55:43,688 --> 00:55:46,588
マジでえっちすぎ
Seriously, this is way too lewd

725
00:55:47,488 --> 00:55:50,188
君たち　なにかんがえてんの？
Guys, what are you thinking about?

726
00:55:51,388 --> 00:55:54,188
分かってるのは　私を
All I know is you're...

727
00:55:55,288 --> 00:55:59,888
だから　今すぐ　暴いてよ
So, expose me right now

728
00:56:03,088 --> 00:56:05,188
だから　バコッ
So, pop it open

729
00:56:10,088 --> 00:56:14,088
あなたの　祭りだね　と
Saying it's your festival

730
00:56:15,588 --> 00:56:21,088
君たち　開けてー
Everyone, open it up!

731
00:56:27,388 --> 00:56:30,088
はい、君たちいかがでしたでしょうか？
So, everyone, how did you like that?

732
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:33,288
お誕生日お祝いしてくれてサンキュー！
Thank you for celebrating my birthday!

733
00:56:33,488 --> 00:56:38,288
今日お披露目しました「I'm Your Treasure Box　あなたはマリン船長を宝箱から見つけた」
Today I premiered "I'm Your Treasure Box: You Found Captain Marine in a Treasure Box."

734
00:56:38,488 --> 00:56:42,388
ミュージックビデオこの後22時からプレミアム公開です。
The music video will have its premiere after this at 10 PM.

735
00:56:43,488 --> 00:56:46,688
24時から各種音楽サイトにて配信開始ですよ。
It'll be available on music streaming sites from midnight.

736
00:56:47,388 --> 00:56:50,088
ミュージックビデオも曲もえっちになってます。
Both the MV and the song are quite lewd.

737
00:56:50,688 --> 00:56:54,288
さあ、そして今年もグッズ出させていただきますよ。
And now, I'll be releasing merch this year as well.

738
00:56:54,488 --> 00:56:59,088
「あー、買わなきゃよかった」と思わないよう、ここは思い切って是非ともご購入ください。
Don't regret it later—take the plunge and buy them now!

739
00:56:59,688 --> 00:57:01,888
まずはこちら、B2タペストリーです。
First up is this B2 tapestry.

740
00:57:02,088 --> 00:57:06,688
今回の新衣装で、船長の母、あかさあい先生描き下ろしです。
It's a new illustration by Akasa Ai-sensei, my creator, in my new outfit.

741
00:57:07,188 --> 00:57:11,788
年々ドロンジョ様然としていくマリンの情味たっぷらなイラストになっています。
It captures Marine's charm as she becomes more like Doronjo every year.

742
00:57:12,388 --> 00:57:15,188
これでいつでも見下ろされて気持ちよくなれる。
Now you can feel good being looked down upon anytime.

743
00:57:15,388 --> 00:57:17,488
続いてこちら、一味Tシャツです。
Next is the Ichimi T-shirt.

744
00:57:17,688 --> 00:57:21,488
マリンとお揃いパーカーは夏場はやはり暑いので...
Since the hoodie matching mine is too hot for summer...

745
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,488
この海賊然としたボーダーシャツでアドを獲ろう。
Get an advantage with this pirate-style striped shirt.

746
00:57:24,788 --> 00:57:29,088
船長のシンボルマークも入っていて、ただのボーダーシャツとは訳が違う。
It has my symbol, so it's not just any striped shirt.

747
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,088
外で着るのが恥ずかしい？
Too embarrassed to wear it outside?

748
00:57:31,288 --> 00:57:34,688
そんな時は身内でウォーリーを探せごっこすることも可能です。
Then you can just play "Where's Waldo?" with your family.

749
00:57:35,088 --> 00:57:38,588
そしてこちらは船長が書きました、ラバーストラップです。
And these are rubber straps illustrated by me!

750
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:42,088
不人気な絵柄があるとショックするので、ランダムにしました。
I'd be shocked if any were unpopular, so it's a random selection.

751
00:57:42,288 --> 00:57:45,088
何が出ても必ず喜んでください。
Be happy with whichever one you get!

752
00:57:45,288 --> 00:57:48,088
そしてそしてこちら、航海日誌風手帳。
And finally, this logbook-style notebook.

753
00:57:48,388 --> 00:57:53,388
大人の男が使ってもイケてるし、メスも優勝確定のおしゃれ手帳。
It's cool for men and definitely a win for the ladies. Very stylish.

754
00:57:54,088 --> 00:57:57,688
船長の帽子のキーホルダーみたいなのも付いてます。
It even comes with a keychain shaped like my hat.

755
00:57:58,288 --> 00:58:00,688
はい、そして今回もフルセットございます。
And yes, we have a full set available again.

756
00:58:00,888 --> 00:58:04,688
全てまとめてご購入いただきましたらば...
If you purchase the whole set...

757
00:58:04,888 --> 00:58:08,588
数量限定、直筆メッセージ入りポストカードと...
You'll get a limited-edition postcard with a handwritten message...

758
00:58:08,788 --> 00:58:13,288
生誕祭前日をイメージしたマリンと君のラブラブシチュエーションボイスをプレゼントします。
And a romantic situation voice pack of you and me the day before the live.

759
00:58:14,088 --> 00:58:17,688
数量限定が売り切れましたらば、複製メッセージ＆サイン入りポストカードになります。
Once the limited set sells out, it'll be a printed message and signature.

760
00:58:18,488 --> 00:58:22,088
こちらもね、船長がぎっしりと、思いを込めてメッセージ書いたので...
I filled those with a lot of thought and messages too...

761
00:58:22,288 --> 00:58:24,588
まあこれはこれで嬉しいみたいなところがある。
So those are pretty great in their own right.

762
00:58:25,188 --> 00:58:29,388
ということで、宝鐘マリン誕生日記念グッズ2022...
So, the Houshou Marine Birthday Commemorative Goods 2022...

763
00:58:30,088 --> 00:58:32,488
22時から販売開始です。
Sales start at 10 PM.

764
00:58:32,788 --> 00:58:36,488
Twitterや概要欄のURLをチェックお願いします。
Please check the link in the description or on Twitter.

765
00:58:37,088 --> 00:58:40,888
あ、それから船長のfigmaも7月29日から受注開始していますので...
Oh, and pre-orders for my figma also started on July 29th...

766
00:58:41,088 --> 00:58:43,688
是非ともゲットしてくださいね。
So make sure to grab one!

767
00:58:44,288 --> 00:58:48,588
そして、何やらホロライブサマーから告知が少しだけあるようです。
And now, it seems there's a little announcement from Hololive Summer.

768
00:58:49,088 --> 00:58:51,688
今からお知らせいたしますよ。
Let's take a look.

769
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:13,688
私が... やらなくちゃ。
I... have to do it.

770
00:59:36,588 --> 00:59:39,088
君たち、今の見ましたか？
Did you guys see that just now?

771
00:59:39,688 --> 00:59:47,388
ということでなんと、ホロライブ・サマー2022本日より開始します！
Hololive Summer 2022 starts today!

772
00:59:49,588 --> 01:00:00,088
いやサマーといえば船長、もう2年近く、2年か、2年くらい本当にね、脱ぎたいという思いでやってきたんですけども...
Speaking of summer, I've spent nearly two years wanting to show more skin...

773
01:00:00,696 --> 01:00:03,529
やだもー、ね、キミたち落ち着いて。脱ぐのが全てじゃない。
Oh stop it, you guys, calm down. Taking clothes off isn't everything.

774
01:00:03,529 --> 01:00:06,429
サマーって色々あるから。え？
There's a lot to summer. Eh?

775
01:00:06,429 --> 01:00:09,396
まあキミたちどうせ水着だと思ってるんでしょうけど
Well, you guys probably think it's all about swimsuits anyway.

776
01:00:09,396 --> 01:00:11,829
わかんないからね。まだわかんないから。
But you don't know yet. You don't know for sure.

777
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:14,396
水着…んー…あー…
Swimsuits... hmm... ah...

778
01:00:14,396 --> 01:00:16,596
もう聞かないで。やめて。引きずり出さないで、
Don't ask anymore. Stop. Don't try to drag it out of me,

779
01:00:16,596 --> 01:00:19,096
船長から情報を引きずり出そうとしないで。
don't try to drag information out of the Captain.

780
01:00:19,562 --> 01:00:23,796
や、でもね、もう本当に、これ船長が勝手に宣言してるんじゃなくて、
But really, it's not just the Captain making this declaration on her own,

781
01:00:23,796 --> 01:00:27,796
これは公式からね、あの、言われて宣言してるんで、
this is being declared because I was told to by the official side,

782
01:00:27,796 --> 01:00:31,029
もうこれは船長が勝手にやってるんじゃなく、
so this isn't just the Captain acting on her own,

783
01:00:31,029 --> 01:00:35,429
本当に公式で全体で盛り上げていくホロライブサマーとなっております。
it's Hololive Summer that the whole official team is going to hype up together.

784
01:00:35,429 --> 01:00:38,629
ということでね、この配信のあとに、
So, after this stream,

785
01:00:38,629 --> 01:00:42,596
公式サイトとティザー、あ、ここに、はい、ご覧ください。
the official site and teaser—oh, here, please take a look.

786
01:00:42,596 --> 01:00:48,629
え、この配信のあとに公式サイトとティザームービーのフルバージョンが公開予定です！
Um, after this stream, the official site and the full version of the teaser movie are scheduled to be released!

787
01:00:48,629 --> 01:00:53,696
詳細はホロライブ公式ツイートをお待ちください。
Please wait for the official Hololive tweet for details.

788
01:00:54,096 --> 01:00:58,629
よし、じゃあちょっとホロライブサマーに向けて、よし、アップしてくか。いきます。出航ー！
Alright then, let's get warmed up for Hololive Summer. Here we go. Setting sail!

789
01:00:59,096 --> 01:01:01,096
バイバーイ！
Bye bye!

790
01:01:08,096 --> 01:01:08,896
キミたち～♡
You guys~♡

791
01:01:08,896 --> 01:01:10,596
生誕祭見てくれてありがとう♡
Thank you for watching the birthday celebration♡

792
01:01:10,596 --> 01:01:13,096
キミたちが力をくれるおかげでやりたいことや夢をかなえられてますが
Thanks to the strength you give me, I'm able to fulfill my dreams and things I want to do,

793
01:01:13,096 --> 01:01:16,096
キミたちに愛されてると、体内からドパドパドパミんが出て若返るワー♡
being loved by you guys makes dopamine gush out from inside me and I feel younger~♡

794
01:01:16,096 --> 01:01:18,096
これからも愛してね♡
Please keep loving me♡

795
01:01:18,096 --> 01:01:21,096
マリンの若さのために。
For Marine's youth.
