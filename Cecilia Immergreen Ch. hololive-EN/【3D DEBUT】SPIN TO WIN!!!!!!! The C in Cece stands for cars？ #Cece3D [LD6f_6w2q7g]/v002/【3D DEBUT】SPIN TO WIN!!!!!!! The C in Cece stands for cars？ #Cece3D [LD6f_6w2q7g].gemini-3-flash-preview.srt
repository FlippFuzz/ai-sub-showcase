4
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:05,588
Well, you might be wondering how I got here.

5
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,888
It all started on my debut one year ago.

6
00:05:18,188 --> 00:05:19,888
Hmm hmm hmm...

7
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:21,888
Whoops! Ah!

8
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:31,588
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you going to play your entire debut VOD?

9
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:34,588
No, but I have a three-hour video essay prepared.

10
00:05:35,388 --> 00:05:38,588
But no, you don't have time or budget for that.

11
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:39,588
What?

12
00:05:39,888 --> 00:05:41,588
Let me fix this.

13
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:42,888
Kronii, no!

14
00:05:58,588 --> 00:06:02,588
Ah, oh man, I wish I had 3D.

15
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:05,388
Whoa, whoa.

16
00:06:06,588 --> 00:06:07,388
Huh?

17
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:11,888
get flashbanged haha

18
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:38,888
Spin to win!

19
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:49,888
Ah, my ankles.

20
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:55,188
Ah, ah, my ankle.

21
00:06:55,388 --> 00:06:59,588
Hello everyone! It's me, Cecilia Immegreen from Hololive English -Justice-.

22
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:01,388
Spin to win!

23
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,388
Yay, I'm 3D!

24
00:07:03,888 --> 00:07:06,388
Oh my god, I'm so nervous, I'm so excited.

25
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:13,888
Hi everyone. Hello todos. Hello everyone in chat. Hello, hello.

26
00:07:14,388 --> 00:07:19,888
It's me, and I was just born out of this egg. Non-canon by the way.

27
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:24,888
Today we'll be going on a beautiful adventure and maybe having some guests.

28
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:29,388
And actually, our very first guest is right here on my shoulder. Who could it be?

29
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:31,388
It's Ottotori! Yay!

30
00:07:31,588 --> 00:07:33,388
Oh, so cute.

31
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:37,888
Yeah, this is our very first guest today. I wonder who else is going to come today. Hmm...

32
00:07:38,188 --> 00:07:40,388
Maybe, maybe some people.

33
00:07:44,388 --> 00:07:47,888
Oh, Otomo! What do you... what do you want?

34
00:07:48,388 --> 00:07:51,888
Wait, you're so cute! *laughs* What do you want, Otomo, huh? What is it?

35
00:07:57,888 --> 00:07:59,188
Mhm.

36
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:01,388
Uh, can I say no?

37
00:08:02,888 --> 00:08:08,888
Okay, so... Otomo has just said... I don't know if you can understand him, he has a very weird dialect.

38
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:15,888
But he just said that since it's been a year since I crashed that car, we're supposed to learn how to drive.

39
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:21,888
Do you guys want to go learn how to drive? Huh? Huh? Should we do it?

40
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:26,888
I guess we should do it, Otomo. Okay, I think...

41
00:08:27,888 --> 00:08:29,888
I wonder what we should be doing next.

42
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:33,888
Okay, let's see guys. Here are options. Please vote in chat.

43
00:08:30,388 --> 00:09:31,388
What should we do now?
a) find a driving teacher
b) ask otomo what to do next

44
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:37,588
First, find a driving teacher.

45
00:08:37,888 --> 00:08:41,888
Or ask Otomo what to do next. Maybe he has a better idea.

46
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,888
Hmm, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

47
00:08:46,388 --> 00:08:50,388
But yeah, while we're waiting for the poll to end, maybe I can show off a little bit.

48
00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:53,888
This is what I look like. Finally, you can see me from the back.

49
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:57,888
Ah, this is my bow, my pretty bow. Yay!

50
00:09:01,588 --> 00:09:05,888
A, B... no, you don't have to type it into chat, you're going to have to like put it into the poll.

51
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:10,888
Okay, is the... is the poll... is the poll good? Shall we see? Oh, not yet.

52
00:09:11,888 --> 00:09:14,888
Okay. Mhm, yeah, the bow. And then if you look closely, you can see that...

53
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:21,888
...everything reflects, everything that's made out of metal. And Ottotori is here too, of course, not forgotten.

54
00:09:22,388 --> 00:09:26,588
Never... never forgotten. And Otomo's very cute.

55
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:29,888
Oh, the poll is over! It's done. Okay, which one won?

56
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:32,888
A, find a driving teacher.

57
00:09:33,388 --> 00:09:35,888
Okay, I think I know exactly where to go.

58
00:09:36,888 --> 00:09:41,888
Wait, but I forgot. If we're going to drive, I'm going to have to take off the skirt...

59
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:46,588
...because it's very stiff and I can't sit in it. Let's do that real quick.

60
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,888
Excuse you! Back off, Otomo, back off!

61
00:09:57,188 --> 00:10:01,388
Ta-da! This is what I look like without the skirt on.

62
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:06,368
Wait! Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

63
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:08,268
Okay, let's go this way.

64
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:09,768
Let's find a driving teacher!

65
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:18,568
Hmm...

66
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:19,768
Huh.

67
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:23,768
According to the Otomo, this is where
I'm supposed to go.

68
00:10:24,268 --> 00:10:25,768
But no one's here.

69
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:26,768
Huh?

70
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:32,768
Be careful!

71
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:38,068
Cece! Cece!

72
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:39,068
Oh my god!

73
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:41,268
Hi everyone!

74
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:44,768
What are you guys doing here?

75
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:47,268
Oh, actually a little Otomo told us...

76
00:10:47,268 --> 00:10:49,268
...you were really bad at driving.

77
00:10:51,268 --> 00:10:52,268
No...

78
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:53,268
No!

79
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:54,768
No, that's a lie!

80
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:56,768
That's fake!

81
00:10:57,268 --> 00:10:58,268
But anyway...

82
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:00,768
Very big galaxy brain Ririka...

83
00:10:58,468 --> 00:11:00,768
一条莉々華
Ichijou Ririka

84
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:02,768
...and Biboo...

85
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:02,768
古石ビジュー
Koseki Bijou

86
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:05,268
...and Sora-senpai...

87
00:11:03,268 --> 00:11:05,268
ときのそら

88
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:06,768
...are gonna tell you...

89
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:08,268
...how to drive!

90
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:14,268
Can you guys drive?

91
00:11:14,368 --> 00:11:15,468
Sure! We're the best!

92
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:16,768
I totally have a license!

93
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:18,568
No I don't. But it is fine.

94
00:11:19,268 --> 00:11:22,268
Okay, I think if you guys are teaching me,
I have nothing to worry about.

95
00:11:22,268 --> 00:11:23,268
So, let's do it!

96
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:25,268
Okay! Well, if you're ready...

97
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,268
...please get on the vehicle.

98
00:11:27,268 --> 00:11:28,768
Your noble steed.

99
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:30,768
So what do I do?

100
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:32,268
Um, you do the...

101
00:11:32,368 --> 00:11:33,468
...you turn the...

102
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:34,268
...you go...

103
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:35,268
Wait, wait!

104
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:18,768
Cece! Are you okay?

105
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:20,068
Are you alright?

106
00:12:21,268 --> 00:12:22,768
Time for destruction!

107
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:24,768
Wait, wait! No, no!

108
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:26,268
I'm okay, I'm okay!

109
00:12:26,268 --> 00:12:27,268
I'm okay, I'm okay!

110
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:28,268
Guys, don't worry.

111
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:29,768
Oh, well she...

112
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:31,068
No, it's okay.

113
00:12:31,768 --> 00:12:34,268
Oh, but that could've gone better,
I think.

114
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:37,268
So let me show you how it's done!

115
00:12:42,768 --> 00:12:44,268
Okay!

116
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:46,768
We'll call this the practical test.

117
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:49,268
Get hit and you'll go boom!

118
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,768
Holokart Time Attack!

119
00:12:54,268 --> 00:12:59,268
Holokart Time Attack

120
00:12:59,468 --> 00:13:01,268
Our racing course is ready!

121
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:08,268
The rules are simple.

122
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:10,768
The four of us will compete to see...

123
00:13:10,268 --> 00:13:17,768
Rule: Race through the course 3 times while avoiding all the obstacles! It's a 4-player showdown for the fastest lap time!

124
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:12,768
...who has the fastest time...

125
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:14,768
...completing the course...

126
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:17,768
...while avoiding all the obstacles!

127
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:21,768
The course starts with two cones.

128
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:24,768
Uh, feel free to dodge it...

129
00:13:24,768 --> 00:13:27,768
...or just knock it down if it's in your way
if you want.

130
00:13:28,768 --> 00:13:31,068
Then you'll enter the barrel zone!

131
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:37,268
Dod-dodge them like a pro!

132
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:40,768
And then finally you aim for the
perfect park...

133
00:13:40,768 --> 00:13:42,268
...at the finish line...

134
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:45,068
...to clear the course!

135
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,268
Simple enough, right?

136
00:13:48,268 --> 00:13:49,768
Easy, easy, easy!

137
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:51,268
No problem!

138
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:56,268
But, but, if you mess up or hit anything
other than the pillar...

139
00:13:56,268 --> 00:14:02,768
Rule: Careful! Touch anything other than cones, and a big explosion awaits!

140
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:59,768
...total explosion!

141
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:05,768
And it won't just explode. Heads up!

142
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:09,768
Each explosion adds a penalty of
three seconds to your time.

143
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,268
So, try not to...

144
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:17,768
Risk it, or risk it, or risk it to do it fast.
It is totally up to you.

145
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:20,768
I don't want to die! No!

146
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:28,268
Okay, I'll go first and show Cece how it's done!

147
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:41,768
So nervous.

148
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,768
Okay, okay, okay!

149
00:14:46,768 --> 00:14:48,768
Always pre-race interviews.

150
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:50,268
Sora-senpai, is there anything you would
like to say?

151
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:53,268
I'll do my best and have fun!

152
00:14:56,368 --> 00:14:58,268
Okay! Sora-senpai, are you ready to...

153
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:01,678
Okay!

154
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:02,478
Okay!

155
00:15:02,478 --> 00:15:03,278
Okay!

156
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:07,478
The Holokart Time Attack starts...

157
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:09,478
Now!

158
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:11,778
3

159
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:12,778
2

160
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:13,878
1

161
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:15,378
Go!

162
00:15:15,478 --> 00:15:18,778
Whoa! Look at Sora-chan! Acceleration!

163
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:22,778
Okay, she goes to the first corner! Whoa!

164
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:25,778
Look at her go! Look at her go!

165
00:15:25,778 --> 00:15:28,778
She's so fast! Whoa!

166
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:33,778
Okay, second corner! Whoa!

167
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:38,378
She's going fast! Okay, second lap is a start!

168
00:15:38,378 --> 00:15:41,378
Keep going, Sora-chan! Go, go, go!

169
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:46,978
Whoa! Oh, she hit the stuff! Whoa!

170
00:15:49,378 --> 00:15:52,378
She's really good! Professional!

171
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:57,378
Here we go, first corner! Go, go, go, Sora!

172
00:15:57,478 --> 00:16:00,378
Look at her! Sora is coming!

173
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:04,378
She's got this! She's so safe!

174
00:16:05,478 --> 00:16:08,478
And she's on the straight! But the last part is so difficult!

175
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:11,878
To the finish line! To the finish line!

176
00:16:12,878 --> 00:16:16,378
Go! Get it! Whoa!

177
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,478
Yeah! I did it!

178
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:24,878
Yeah! Good job! Good job Sora-chan!

179
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:30,878
That was explosive!

180
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:32,378
Yeah!

181
00:16:32,478 --> 00:16:35,378
Okay, now we're checking the final time.

182
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:38,478
So, in the meantime, how was it? How do you think?

183
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:42,578
Ah, I think I did great!

184
00:16:47,878 --> 00:16:49,878
Okay, let's look at the time.

185
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:55,978
Oh, one minute and three seconds!

186
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:56,878
FINAL TIME 01:03

187
00:16:57,478 --> 00:16:59,378
That's actually really good.

188
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:04,478
And you got one explosion, so three seconds is added.

189
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:08,578
Ah, but very fast! So fast!

190
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:14,878
Okay, okay, okay. Who's next?

191
00:17:14,878 --> 00:17:17,878
Who will be our next challenger?

192
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:20,478
Hey, I'll go! Yeah!

193
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:26,878
Okay, Raora-chan, step up to the starting line right here.

194
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:33,878
All right, Raora-chan, is there anything you would like to say to the audience or Senpai or anything?

195
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:37,978
I will show you my Holomunky seat! Nice driving!

196
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,478
All right, Raora-chan, are you ready?

197
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:45,478
Sure! I can do it!

198
00:17:45,578 --> 00:17:48,578
Okay! She sounds very, very sure about herself.

199
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:52,478
Let's see if she can put her skills to the test.

200
00:17:52,578 --> 00:17:56,578
All right, the Holokart Time Attack starts...

201
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:58,578
Now!

202
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:01,978
3

203
00:18:02,478 --> 00:18:04,478
Okay, okay, okay, you got this!

204
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:05,578
頑張って！
Do your best!

205
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:06,878
Go!

206
00:18:07,478 --> 00:18:10,478
Woohoo! Oh! Stay away!

207
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:14,878
Go away from me! No!

208
00:18:19,878 --> 00:18:22,878
I don't want to die! No!

209
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:28,478
I don't want to die! No!

210
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:34,478
Whoa! No! Stop!

211
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:38,478
Ah! No!

212
00:18:42,478 --> 00:18:44,478
Stop it!

213
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:51,478
Oh! You got this! Go!

214
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:54,478
Go! Finish line! Finish line!

215
00:19:02,478 --> 00:19:05,478
Ah! I did it!

216
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:11,478
Yeah! Raora-chan! Finish line!

217
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:16,578
That was really good.

218
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:21,478
We're checking the time now, but let's hear it. Are you okay from the challenger?

219
00:19:21,478 --> 00:19:24,478
Yeah, I'm fine. How was it?

220
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:31,878
I will never drive. I met Kisama.

221
00:19:31,978 --> 00:19:34,978
That might be for the best, you know.

222
00:19:34,978 --> 00:19:38,478
Yes, I have to be your sensei and senpai.

223
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:42,878
All right, Raora-chan, your time...

224
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:46,978
...is one minute and nine seconds!

225
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,378
FINAL TIME 01:09

226
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,478
Yeah!

227
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:55,878
You received five explosions, so five penalties, a total of fifteen second penalty.

228
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:59,978
So that means I was faster than Sora-chan Senpai?

229
00:19:59,978 --> 00:20:03,378
You were, but you hit the stuff, so yeah.

230
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:05,972
Our next...

231
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:06,772
...next...

232
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,872
...Biboo!

233
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:10,172
It's Biboo's turn now!

234
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:12,572
Hehe... It's Biboo's turn.

235
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:15,172
Anything you'd like to say?

236
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,972
I will win!

237
00:20:16,972 --> 00:20:18,672
She's gonna lose.

238
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:21,472
No, Biboo's so good.

239
00:20:21,472 --> 00:20:23,172
Don't have confidence?

240
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:24,672
Yeah, she's good at gaming,

241
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:27,672
so maybe driving is also very good.

242
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:29,072
We'll see.

243
00:20:29,072 --> 00:20:30,172
Okay...

244
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:31,172
...start...

245
00:20:31,172 --> 00:20:33,072
...now!

246
00:20:35,172 --> 00:20:37,972
Uwah!

247
00:20:37,972 --> 00:20:39,672
Go, go, go!

248
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,072
Uwah! Sugoi!
Uwah! Awesome!

249
00:20:42,072 --> 00:20:47,672
Uwah!

250
00:21:16,472 --> 00:21:17,972
I'm coming!

251
00:21:22,472 --> 00:21:25,672
I'm the best!

252
00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:32,172
Uwah! Final lap!

253
00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:34,672
Final lap! Here's the finish! Uwah!

254
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:46,772
Yeah, that was really good!

255
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:50,972
Good job!

256
00:21:52,972 --> 00:21:54,672
You okay?

257
00:21:54,672 --> 00:21:55,972
I win!

258
00:21:55,972 --> 00:22:00,372
I win! I win! I win!

259
00:22:00,372 --> 00:22:02,272
Just taking the time of Holokart.

260
00:22:02,272 --> 00:22:03,172
Let's see, let's see...

261
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:04,672
That was...

262
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:07,172
...maybe I shouldn't drive either.

263
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:08,572
Guys, you are my teachers.

264
00:22:08,572 --> 00:22:10,972
Only Sora-chan so far has driven safely.

265
00:22:12,972 --> 00:22:15,072
Oh wait, time is coming.

266
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:17,972
Oh, so finally...

267
00:22:17,972 --> 00:22:21,472
...you were 1 minute and 11 seconds!

268
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:24,072
FINAL TIME 01:11

269
00:22:24,072 --> 00:22:25,872
So that means you were the slowest.

270
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:30,472
You got four times explosions.

271
00:22:30,472 --> 00:22:32,772
So that means 20 seconds added.

272
00:22:32,772 --> 00:22:35,472
Dang it, oh well, whatever.

273
00:22:35,472 --> 00:22:38,072
Anyway, I still had the time of my life though.

274
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:40,072
It was a blast!

275
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:45,572
No battle please.

276
00:22:48,872 --> 00:22:51,972
For our last challenger...

277
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:57,172
...we have prepared for you a special course...

278
00:22:57,172 --> 00:22:59,872
...because you are our student, right?

279
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,672
Because you've already seen this...

280
00:23:04,672 --> 00:23:06,772
...so you have an advantage going last.

281
00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:08,872
So we're not going to give you that advantage, okay?

282
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:12,172
Here it is!

283
00:23:14,972 --> 00:23:16,372
Wow!

284
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:17,872
It's Justice!

285
00:23:17,872 --> 00:23:19,672
It's Justice!

286
00:23:19,672 --> 00:23:21,472
It's Justice!

287
00:23:21,472 --> 00:23:24,072
Yeah, Justice 3D was not in our budget, so...

288
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:26,672
...we have cutouts.

289
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,472
Thanks, guys!

290
00:23:28,472 --> 00:23:30,172
Also, just so you know,

291
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:32,172
this is your driver's practical,

292
00:23:32,172 --> 00:23:34,672
so you're going to have to beat our average time.

293
00:23:34,672 --> 00:23:37,072
And our average time...

294
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:39,572
...was 1 minute and 8 seconds!

295
00:23:39,572 --> 00:23:42,772
Driving test cleared if the trio's average time is faster than 1 minute and 8 seconds!

296
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:44,172
So that's the time that you've got to beat.

297
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,472
I got this.

298
00:23:45,472 --> 00:23:47,172
Okay, watch me.

299
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:48,572
It's okay, guys, don't worry.

300
00:23:48,572 --> 00:23:49,972
Easy, easy, easy.

301
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:51,972
This is what I've been training for...

302
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,472
...for the last 10 minutes.

303
00:23:53,472 --> 00:23:55,172
Don't worry about it.

304
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:57,172
Okay, I'm ready.

305
00:23:57,172 --> 00:23:58,672
Alright...

306
00:23:58,672 --> 00:24:01,172
...anything you'd like to say before the race?

307
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:03,172
Spin to win!

308
00:24:03,172 --> 00:24:05,472
Wulululululu!

309
00:24:05,472 --> 00:24:07,172
Yeah, you should spin as much as possible.

310
00:24:08,872 --> 00:24:10,172
I'll do it for you.

311
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:13,172
Thank you, thank you. Okay, let's go.

312
00:24:13,172 --> 00:24:15,172
Any advice for Cecile-senpai?

313
00:24:19,572 --> 00:24:21,472
At first...
First...

314
00:24:21,472 --> 00:24:23,572
...never slow down.

315
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,772
Second...

316
00:24:26,772 --> 00:24:29,072
...go faster than Okone-chan!

317
00:24:29,072 --> 00:24:31,672
Wow! Go faster!

318
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,172
You can do it!

319
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:43,572
The Holokart Time Attack...

320
00:24:43,572 --> 00:24:45,072
...starts...

321
00:24:45,072 --> 00:24:47,172
...now!

322
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:54,695
Get hit and you'll go Boom! Holokart Time Attack

323
00:25:16,095 --> 00:25:17,595
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

324
00:25:17,695 --> 00:25:18,895
Don't hit me! Oh!

325
00:25:20,195 --> 00:25:22,795
I'm so good! Whoa!

326
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:25,895
Okay, second lap, let's go!

327
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,895
Watch out! No!

328
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:35,495
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay...

329
00:25:36,595 --> 00:25:37,895
Okay...

330
00:25:40,095 --> 00:25:41,595
Okay! Now for the finish!

331
00:25:42,495 --> 00:25:44,395
You have to park!

332
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:46,995
Park!

333
00:25:51,695 --> 00:25:54,395
Yay!

334
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:59,095
That was... wow. That was really... are you sure you should be teaching us?

335
00:25:59,795 --> 00:26:01,595
Maybe I should be teaching you guys.

336
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:06,895
What do you think your time was?

337
00:26:07,295 --> 00:26:08,795
Faster than AZKi's or not?

338
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:10,895
20 seconds.

339
00:26:10,995 --> 00:26:12,895
20 seconds?! No way!

340
00:26:13,395 --> 00:26:15,695
But how do you feel after the race?

341
00:26:16,195 --> 00:26:20,695
Invigorated. I feel like I learned so much today.

342
00:26:21,195 --> 00:26:22,395
Were we good teachers?

343
00:26:22,695 --> 00:26:24,395
You especially, IRyS.

344
00:26:28,395 --> 00:26:29,695
Oh, time's coming.

345
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:35,295
What? Your time is... 56 seconds! Oh my god!

346
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:39,395
FINAL TIME 00:56

347
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:37,395
Yay!

348
00:26:41,495 --> 00:26:44,195
You only got one penalty! Oh my god!

349
00:26:45,495 --> 00:26:49,795
Wow, Cece. You... passed!

350
00:27:01,195 --> 00:27:03,995
Oh, your driving was spot on! So, off you go!

351
00:27:07,295 --> 00:27:09,495
Bye-bye! Thank you for teaching me!

352
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,695
Bye-bye! Have fun in the car!

353
00:27:15,095 --> 00:27:18,695
Wait, I want to go too! Wait, wait, let's go!

354
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:25,395
Wait, can I get in a car? Wait, wait! Whoa!

355
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:34,695
Wait, what are we doing?

356
00:27:34,895 --> 00:27:36,595
Going on a drive.

357
00:27:36,995 --> 00:27:38,695
Wait, we need a third.

358
00:27:38,795 --> 00:27:39,995
Ah, right.

359
00:27:40,795 --> 00:27:43,895
Biboo!

361
00:28:09,095 --> 00:28:10,795
One, two, three, let's go!

362
00:28:10,895 --> 00:28:13,895
Lost hope in love, I thought I'd never understand

363
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:17,195
Couldn't help it when you took my hand

364
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,795
Roads ignored before, you left me wanting more

365
00:28:19,895 --> 00:28:22,795
Destroyed everything just to get a bit ahead

366
00:28:22,895 --> 00:28:25,795
Neon lights fly by, is it fake or reality?

367
00:28:25,895 --> 00:28:28,895
Not sure of much but know I'm ready

368
00:28:28,995 --> 00:28:32,195
Soaring these streets make me complete

369
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:35,795
Full throttle, come give me your all

370
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:38,295
Engine's not keeping up

371
00:28:38,395 --> 00:28:42,195
With the beat of my heart, just can't get enough

372
00:28:42,295 --> 00:28:44,595
Revving up, make it fast

373
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:48,295
Only us, make it last till the sun's up

374
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:49,795
One, two, three, let's go!

375
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,795
Nother' shot in the dark, take me away

376
00:28:52,895 --> 00:28:55,795
Fizzing up in my heart, it's all okay

377
00:28:55,895 --> 00:28:58,295
Accelerate me until I'm there

378
00:28:58,395 --> 00:29:01,695
You and I reach the line, mark the end but we'll... let's go!

379
00:29:02,195 --> 00:29:04,795
Keep on goin' until the bubbles fade

380
00:29:04,895 --> 00:29:07,595
I don't care if I don't see another day

381
00:29:07,695 --> 00:29:10,495
Shocking in my heart, give me all that you got

382
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:13,595
Windows down, don't hesitate a minute more

383
00:29:13,695 --> 00:29:16,495
Time is up, not enough, fill it up

384
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:19,695
and don't look back again

385
00:29:19,795 --> 00:29:21,795
Carbonated love

386
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,495
One, two, three, let's go!

387
00:29:32,595 --> 00:29:35,595
Took a bet on love, it's better than I could've dreamed

388
00:29:35,695 --> 00:29:38,595
Look at what we've done, we're too extreme

389
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:41,495
Pour me your favorite drink, so much until we sink

390
00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:44,595
Down to the bottom, don't wanna miss a thing

391
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:47,995
The track we're on might crash, oh what am I to do?

392
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:51,195
Rushing in, ignoring old avenues

393
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:54,195
Race through the night, my guiding light

394
00:29:54,295 --> 00:29:56,895
Sparkling, I'm right here with you

395
00:29:57,995 --> 00:30:03,395
Engine's not keeping up with the beat of my heart, just can't get enough

396
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,240
With the beat of my heart, just can't get enough

397
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,340
Revving up, make it fast

398
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,240
Only us, make it last

399
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,040
Till the sun's up

400
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,540
One, two, let's go!

401
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,640
Another shot in the dark, take me away

402
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,740
Fizzing up in my heart, it's all okay

403
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,940
Accelerate me until I'm there

404
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,540
You and I reach a line, mark the end but we'll

405
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,140
Let's go!

406
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,640
Keep on goin' until the bubbles fade

407
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,640
I don't care if I don't see another day

408
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,640
Let's go!

409
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,140
Shocking in my heart, give me all that you got

410
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,540
Windows down, don't hesitate a minute more

411
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,540
Love's the rush, we shouldn't, don't give up, fire it up again

412
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,540
Time is up, not enough, fill it up

413
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
and don't look back again

414
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,140
Carbonated love

415
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,340
Come overflow my cup, I'm empty without you

416
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,340
Make such a mess of me, don't care if I'm the fool

417
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,340
Another night of bliss, speed up, let's make it new

418
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,640
Love me despite the way I'm crazy just for you

419
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,340
Another shot in the dark, take me away

420
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,340
Fizzing up in my heart, it's all okay

421
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,340
Accelerate me until I'm there

422
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,040
You and I reach a line, mark the end but we'll

423
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,140
Let's go!

424
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,540
Keep on goin' until the bubbles fade

425
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,440
I don't care if I don't see another day

426
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,340
Shocking in my heart, give me all that you got

427
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,140
Windows down, don't hesitate a minute more

428
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,440
Love the rush, we shouldn't, don't give up, fire it up again

429
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,440
Our time is up, not enough, fill it up

430
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,140
and begin

431
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,140
Carbonated love

432
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,640
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

433
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,140
Wait! Wait! Wait!

434
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,640
It's your fault!

435
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,140
It's your fault!

436
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,640
(Chuckles) Losers.

437
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,640
Oh! Otomo, you took people's place!

438
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,640
Wow! Amazing!

439
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,640
Can you even see the road?

440
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,640
Wait, wait, I saw the road. I saw the road.

441
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,140
No, no, don't worry guys. It's fine, there's no cars here.

442
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,240
There's barely any cars, so... really, it's completely fine.

443
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,640
But yeah, do you see? Do you see how much I've learned in such a little time?

444
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,640
Do you feel safe next... guys, do you feel safe next to me in this car?

445
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,140
What are you saying, Otomo? Do you... I... Is it safe here? Huh?

446
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,140
Yeah, I think so. Whoa!

447
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,640
What's that? Otomo, look!

448
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,140
Can you... Otomos are popping up and look!

449
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:40,140
Oh! I had turned this off for today because I didn't want it to disrupt, you know, my special day, but...

450
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,140
I guess since we're in the car, it makes sense that... that Otomos would fall from the sky!

451
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,140
Yeah, every membership or gift membership gives a little plop!

452
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:58,640
It's like a birth. Wow, the circle of Otomo life! That is so beautiful.

453
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,640
Wow, that's incredi... whoa!

454
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,140
I wish I could see you Otomo, but you're so small.

455
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,640
I wish you could see the road and be impressed with how good I am at driving, you know?

456
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,640
Wow! (Laughs) You are so cute. Wait, can I pet you?

457
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,640
Pet pet pet pet pet pet pet.

458
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:23,640
Okay, okay. Well, anyways, I hope you are impressed by my driving today. Yeah, I really do hope so.

459
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:30,640
But I think that's too... I think that's too many. I think that's enough Otomos, because otherwise I'll struggle with seeing the road.

460
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,640
Okay, that's enough! Okay, okay, you can stop now! No! No! Ah! Hey!

461
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,640
Stop, stop! Stop it! Stop! No, no, no, no, stop! Stop, it's enough!

462
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,640
Stop! Stop! That's too many! Stop, stop!

463
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,640
Ah! I can't see! Get rid of those!

464
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,640
Ah! I can't see! I can't! I can't see! Ah!

465
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,140
Ah! Ah! Ahhhhh!

466
00:35:54,396 --> 00:35:56,763
What? What?

467
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:58,330
Where?

468
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,696
What is this?

469
00:35:59,696 --> 00:36:00,930
Where am I?

470
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,463
Whoa!

471
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,163
It's so pretty in here!

472
00:36:06,796 --> 00:36:08,296
Whoa!

473
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,663
Wait, I think I want to match this aesthetic a little bit better.

474
00:36:11,663 --> 00:36:13,063
Let me get my skirt back.

475
00:36:16,763 --> 00:36:19,363
Ta-da! Wow!

476
00:36:19,963 --> 00:36:21,463
Otomo! Otomo! Otomo!

477
00:36:21,963 --> 00:36:23,363
Oh...

478
00:36:24,263 --> 00:36:26,263
There you are! You little—

479
00:36:26,263 --> 00:36:27,530
—this is your fault!

480
00:36:27,763 --> 00:36:30,296
How dare you fall on top of my car and make us crash!

481
00:36:30,596 --> 00:36:32,863
You stupid little—you—

482
00:36:32,863 --> 00:36:34,630
—why did you do that to me...

483
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,796
...with all your little Otomo friends, huh?

484
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:36,563
What did I ever do to deserve that, huh?

485
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:39,930
You know what? This is your fault as well!

486
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,096
How dare you make me crash!

487
00:36:42,096 --> 00:36:43,363
You little—

488
00:36:43,363 --> 00:36:44,063
You stupid—

489
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,530
I worked so hard for this!

490
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,330
I worked so hard today and you—

491
00:36:49,663 --> 00:36:50,863
No. Okay. No.

492
00:36:51,063 --> 00:36:53,363
No, it's okay. Come back up. Come back up.

493
00:36:53,363 --> 00:36:55,296
Come back up, you baby. It's okay.

494
00:36:56,063 --> 00:36:57,763
And guys, not the right answer.

495
00:36:57,763 --> 00:36:59,630
This—no...

496
00:36:59,896 --> 00:37:01,096
Oh, Otomo is shaking, I guess.

497
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:03,363
I guess he must be really afraid.

498
00:37:03,896 --> 00:37:05,363
Okay, I'll take a step back.

499
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:06,463
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

500
00:37:06,463 --> 00:37:08,363
Anger's not the right answer right now.

501
00:37:08,963 --> 00:37:11,263
We are trapped in this beautiful world and maybe...

502
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:14,430
...hmm, we're gonna have to find out what we have—what we're supposed to do here.

503
00:37:14,663 --> 00:37:16,163
Otomo, do you have any ideas?

504
00:37:21,963 --> 00:37:23,463
Huh? Of course!

505
00:37:23,463 --> 00:37:24,996
How did I not think about that?

506
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,263
This is the inner clockwork world of our minds!

507
00:37:30,296 --> 00:37:33,063
Both you and me, Otomo, or just me, I'm not sure.

508
00:37:33,063 --> 00:37:34,430
What do you think?

509
00:37:36,196 --> 00:37:38,996
Hmm... He doesn't know either.

510
00:37:41,463 --> 00:37:44,430
Okay, so what we have to do here, apparently, is...

511
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,763
...Otomo wants to learn how to feel emotions.

512
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:48,363
Human emotions.

513
00:37:48,363 --> 00:37:49,863
Otomo wants to be human.

514
00:37:50,596 --> 00:37:52,696
So, even though I'm an automaton...

515
00:37:52,696 --> 00:37:54,196
...I do understand a lot of emotions...

516
00:37:54,196 --> 00:37:55,863
...with all my time on Earth.

517
00:37:56,596 --> 00:37:59,730
And I think my favorite emotion of all time is...

518
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,763
...Joy!

519
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,430
So, let's teach Otomo some joy, shall we?

520
00:38:03,663 --> 00:38:06,996
And what's the most joyous thing in the entire world, guys?

521
00:38:07,196 --> 00:38:09,330
Of course... music!

522
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,430
Playing music with others.

523
00:38:11,663 --> 00:38:13,830
So, let's play some music, shall we?

524
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:20,063
Yay!

525
00:38:21,596 --> 00:38:23,063
Ah! Flashbang.

526
00:38:23,296 --> 00:38:24,996
What? Why do I have—

527
00:38:24,996 --> 00:38:26,330
—why do I have my violin?

528
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,263
Huh. That's weird.

529
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:30,596
Cece! Cece! Cece!

530
00:38:30,863 --> 00:38:32,930
Whoa! Oh my god!

531
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,763
All of you here!

532
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:38,030
And with instruments!

533
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,830
Yeah!

534
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:41,563
Does that mean that my dream...

535
00:38:41,563 --> 00:38:43,830
...of having a school band is finally coming true?

536
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,230
Yeah! Let's join her!

537
00:38:46,863 --> 00:38:49,430
Okay, okay! Shall we play a song together?

538
00:38:49,463 --> 00:38:51,030
Yeah!

539
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,930
Okay, okay, okay.

540
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,530
Let's do it! Woo!

541
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:16,563

543
00:42:13,421 --> 00:42:15,186
Whoo! Yeah!

544
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:20,930
Yay! Thank you so much, guys!

545
00:42:23,485 --> 00:42:24,903
Oh, look!

546
00:42:24,903 --> 00:42:25,903
Otomo?

547
00:42:26,803 --> 00:42:28,903
So cute!

548
00:42:30,103 --> 00:42:32,203
Is that a gear of emotions?

549
00:42:32,703 --> 00:42:34,803
Oh my gosh! Is he gonna learn?

550
00:42:35,103 --> 00:42:36,903
Whoa!

551
00:42:36,903 --> 00:42:39,103
Ah! She learned joy!

552
00:42:40,603 --> 00:42:43,203
She learned joy! Yay! Happy, happy!

553
00:42:44,903 --> 00:42:47,203
Thanks to you guys! Thank you so much!

554
00:42:47,703 --> 00:42:50,903
Thank you! Thank you guys!

555
00:42:51,203 --> 00:42:54,903
Bye-bye!

556
00:42:57,603 --> 00:42:58,903
I gotta go!

557
00:42:58,903 --> 00:43:00,203
Come on!

558
00:43:00,603 --> 00:43:02,703
Okay, you can go now. Okay.

559
00:43:02,803 --> 00:43:04,403
Okay, bye!

560
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:12,903
Yay!

561
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:15,903
Okay, wait, let me put this away for now.

562
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:18,203
I'll get it back in a second. Wait.

563
00:43:19,703 --> 00:43:22,903
That was so much fun! What did you think, guys?

564
00:43:23,203 --> 00:43:25,903
Oh, Otomo, did you learn how to be happy? Are you happy now?

565
00:43:28,203 --> 00:43:30,403
Yeah?

566
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:33,603
So cute! That was so much fun!

567
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,103
Yay! It was like... okay, that's enough.

568
00:43:36,403 --> 00:43:39,903
That was like a dream come true for me to play with everyone together,

569
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,903
so I'm really happy about that.

570
00:43:42,403 --> 00:43:45,903
Wow, dreams really do come true in this Clockwork World, huh?

571
00:43:46,203 --> 00:43:49,203
But don't you worry, we have more emotions that we need to learn.

572
00:43:49,703 --> 00:43:52,403
Um, next one is representative for me, guys.

573
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,603
What do you think? What do you think is me?

574
00:43:55,903 --> 00:43:59,203
What is weatherly me right now, always? Hmm...

575
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,403
Hmm... what could it be?

576
00:44:01,603 --> 00:44:03,403
No, not that one. No, not that one.

577
00:44:03,603 --> 00:44:05,803
No, not that one. No, it's not hate.

578
00:44:06,003 --> 00:44:09,203
No! It is... laziness!

579
00:44:10,903 --> 00:44:14,903
So, Otomo, don't you worry, I'll, I'll, I'll teach you how to be really, really lazy.

580
00:44:15,203 --> 00:44:18,203
And, um, we, let's try, let's see. What do you think?

581
00:44:18,403 --> 00:44:22,903
What should we do, Otomo? If you want to be lazy, which one, which option of these two would you do?

582
00:44:19,773 --> 00:44:22,757
What should we do now?

583
00:44:21,837 --> 00:44:22,838
a) Let's go on a hike!

584
00:44:21,837 --> 00:44:22,838
b) I'm hungry let's get some food.

585
00:44:24,403 --> 00:44:26,903
A) Let's go on a hike!

586
00:44:27,403 --> 00:44:30,903
Or B) I'm hungry, let's get some food.

587
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:33,903
On a hike? Seriously?

588
00:44:34,203 --> 00:44:37,403
Oh, no, no, these options are terrible. Terrible options,

589
00:44:37,603 --> 00:44:40,603
terrible, awful, awful, terrible options. Eugh!

590
00:44:40,903 --> 00:44:43,403
That's not how you're lazy, Otomo! No, this is...

591
00:44:43,603 --> 00:44:45,403
...this is how you're lazy!

592
00:44:45,703 --> 00:44:48,403
So please, guys, you have to vote again.

593
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:49,123
What should we do now?

594
00:44:47,797 --> 00:44:48,798
a) Let's just not do anything...

595
00:44:47,797 --> 00:44:48,798
b) You decide...

596
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,903
A) Let's just not do anything...

597
00:44:51,203 --> 00:44:52,903
Or B) You decide...

598
00:44:53,203 --> 00:44:55,903
And with 'you' I mean me. Not you. No, you. No, no, me.

599
00:44:56,203 --> 00:44:59,603
I decide. I should have written Cecilia Immergreen decides.

600
00:45:00,603 --> 00:45:02,403
You want food? Well...

601
00:45:03,062 --> 00:45:05,162
What should we do now?
a) Let's just not do anything...
b) You decide...

602
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:07,562
But yeah, ultimate laziness is when you don't do anything.

603
00:45:07,662 --> 00:45:09,562
Oh, you have deadlines? Meh.

604
00:45:09,662 --> 00:45:13,062
Oh, you have really important things to do? Procrastinate.

605
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:16,262
Oh, things are coming up in your calendar? Meh, forget about it.

606
00:45:16,362 --> 00:45:20,462
Everything's messy and it's the worst it's ever been in your room?

607
00:45:20,562 --> 00:45:23,562
Meh, forget about it too. Just stay in bed and do absolutely nothing.

608
00:45:23,662 --> 00:45:26,062
Yeah, I think that's really important.

609
00:45:26,162 --> 00:45:30,262
And it's very, very important that you learn how to do that...

610
00:45:30,362 --> 00:45:31,862
...because that's one of the many emotions of being a human.

611
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,062
Okay, let's see, what's the poll result?

612
00:45:34,162 --> 00:45:36,462
What's the poll result? Hmm... Hmm...

613
00:45:37,262 --> 00:45:40,062
Let's just not do anything.

614
00:45:40,162 --> 00:45:42,062
Wow, Otomos are so smart.

615
00:45:42,162 --> 00:45:44,562
Okay, don't do anything.

616
00:45:55,362 --> 00:45:57,062
And we... (laughs)

617
00:45:57,162 --> 00:45:59,562
That's exactly it. I'm so proud of you Otomo.

618
00:45:59,662 --> 00:46:04,062
That's how you learn, that's how you learn laziness and how to be lazy.

619
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,162
Oh, there it is! There's the gear of emotion.

620
00:46:07,262 --> 00:46:10,562
Okay... He's taking it in. Oh...

621
00:46:10,762 --> 00:46:14,562
Cute! Oh, that's so...

622
00:46:16,662 --> 00:46:25,562
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no...

623
00:46:27,562 --> 00:46:30,562
Anyways, so, what is the next emotion that we need to learn?

624
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:33,862
Obviously, what is human if not...

625
00:46:34,062 --> 00:46:37,562
...okay, so we have joy, lazy...

626
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:41,162
...and the next one is obviously...

627
00:46:41,262 --> 00:46:42,662
Hate.

628
00:46:42,862 --> 00:46:46,062
So, no, come back Otomo, it's okay. I'll tell you a little bit about the things that I hate.

629
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:52,062
So, I hate... hmm... Okay, okay, okay, listen.

630
00:46:52,562 --> 00:46:55,062
I hate coffee. I hate raisins.

631
00:46:55,162 --> 00:46:57,562
I hate green peas. I hate olives on pizza.

632
00:46:57,662 --> 00:47:01,562
I hate when something stops working and suddenly starts working again when you turn it off and on again.

633
00:47:01,662 --> 00:47:04,262
I hate long queues. I hate waiting.

634
00:47:04,362 --> 00:47:07,062
I hate when I can't sleep at night.

635
00:47:07,162 --> 00:47:11,062
I hate when the pillow is too warm and the blanket's too warm.

636
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:16,062
But then you take off the blanket but then it's too cold and then you have to put the blanket back on.

637
00:47:16,162 --> 00:47:21,562
And I hate when they make updates for programs and websites that are absolute downgrades.

638
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:26,562
Okay. Okay.

639
00:47:26,662 --> 00:47:30,062
And you know what I also hate Otomo?

640
00:47:30,162 --> 00:47:33,262
The fact that I prepared a lot of stuff for today, but you...

641
00:47:33,362 --> 00:47:37,062
...and you, made it so that I crashed and I came into this world...

642
00:47:37,162 --> 00:47:39,562
...and now I can't prepare it, I mean, show it to you.

643
00:47:39,662 --> 00:47:41,262
But maybe I should show you anyways.

644
00:47:41,362 --> 00:47:43,562
Okay, I'll show you. I'll show you anyways.

645
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:48,062
It's fine. I mean, this is a circular stage.

646
00:47:48,562 --> 00:47:50,862
Okay, Otomos, please listen.

647
00:47:59,862 --> 00:48:03,062
薔薇の誓い
Music: 光宗信吉
Oath of the Rose
Music: Shinkichi Mitsumune

648
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,062
Yay!

649
00:49:44,162 --> 00:49:47,862
That was Bara no Chikai from Revolutionary Girl Utena OST.

650
00:49:47,962 --> 00:49:50,062
I love it, I love that OST, it's one of my favorite OSTs.

651
00:49:50,162 --> 00:49:51,862
Oh, what? What? Huh?

652
00:49:52,062 --> 00:49:54,562
Oh, sorry, I just got a message.

653
00:49:55,462 --> 00:49:59,862
Oh, apparently I read the poll wrong earlier and it was actually "You decide".

654
00:50:00,562 --> 00:50:03,062
My bad guys.

655
00:50:03,162 --> 00:50:05,562
I decide what to do next.

656
00:50:05,987 --> 00:50:07,287
You know what I decide?

657
00:50:07,287 --> 00:50:09,187
I decided that we're going to look

658
00:50:09,187 --> 00:50:11,087
at this beautiful stage!

659
00:50:11,087 --> 00:50:12,487
It's so warm!

660
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:13,487
Oh my god!

661
00:50:14,487 --> 00:50:15,987
Well, this looks so cool though!

662
00:50:15,987 --> 00:50:17,787
Where did all the fire come from?

663
00:50:17,787 --> 00:50:19,187
I guess from our rage.

664
00:50:19,187 --> 00:50:21,487
So Otomo, did you learn how to be...

665
00:50:21,487 --> 00:50:22,787
I mean, hate, hatred?

666
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:25,487
Did you learn how to be hateful?

667
00:50:27,987 --> 00:50:29,487
He's learned...

668
00:50:29,487 --> 00:50:30,187
Oh!

669
00:50:30,187 --> 00:50:33,487
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

670
00:50:33,487 --> 00:50:34,987
Whoa, Otomo, whoa! Don't say that!

671
00:50:34,987 --> 00:50:36,987
No, don't listen to him! Don't listen to him!

672
00:50:36,987 --> 00:50:39,187
No! No, don't! No, we're gonna get demonetized!

673
00:50:39,187 --> 00:50:40,987
No, no, no, no, no!

674
00:50:40,987 --> 00:50:42,487
Okay, okay, okay, just ignore him.

675
00:50:42,487 --> 00:50:44,987
Okay, I'm gonna talk a little bit louder

676
00:50:44,987 --> 00:50:47,487
so you can't hear him cursing.

677
00:50:47,487 --> 00:50:49,487
Okay, well, this is a really cool stage

678
00:50:49,487 --> 00:50:50,987
and everything, but it's way too warm!

679
00:50:50,987 --> 00:50:52,487
So, I think we're...

680
00:50:52,987 --> 00:50:54,487
Shut up!

681
00:50:54,987 --> 00:50:56,487
Okay, this is way too warm,

682
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:58,487
so I think we're going to have to turn it back.

683
00:50:58,487 --> 00:50:59,487
How about that?

684
00:50:59,487 --> 00:51:01,487
And since this is the inner clockwork

685
00:51:01,487 --> 00:51:04,487
of our, clockwork world of our minds...

686
00:51:04,487 --> 00:51:06,487
I can turn it back with just a spin!

687
00:51:06,487 --> 00:51:09,487
Turn it back!

688
00:51:16,487 --> 00:51:18,487
Ah, that's way nicer.

689
00:51:18,487 --> 00:51:21,487
Wow, look! So pretty!

690
00:51:21,487 --> 00:51:23,987
No, that's so nice. I'm so excited.

691
00:51:23,987 --> 00:51:26,987
And it's green! Everything's green!

692
00:51:26,987 --> 00:51:28,487
Just like Cecilia Immergreen

693
00:51:28,487 --> 00:51:30,987
from Hololive English -Justice-!

694
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:32,487
Yay!

695
00:51:32,487 --> 00:51:33,987
Okay, well, what do we have next?

696
00:51:33,987 --> 00:51:35,487
Oh, another emotion shall we, Otomo?

697
00:51:35,487 --> 00:51:37,487
Because obviously, it's four emotions

698
00:51:37,487 --> 00:51:40,487
because there's four people in Justice...

699
00:51:40,487 --> 00:51:42,987
...so the best number in the entire world is four.

700
00:51:42,987 --> 00:51:46,987
Two peace, two, four, four, four, four Justice!

701
00:51:46,987 --> 00:51:48,487
So Otomo, I'm going to...

702
00:51:48,487 --> 00:51:50,987
I have one song prepared for you.

703
00:51:50,987 --> 00:51:53,487
And for you! I worked really hard on this one.

704
00:51:53,487 --> 00:51:55,987
It's a bit scuffed, but that's okay,

705
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,987
you know, that's okay.

706
00:51:58,987 --> 00:52:01,487
Please listen and watch

707
00:52:01,487 --> 00:52:04,487

772
00:58:01,029 --> 00:58:05,029
Okay guys, don't worry, I got this. I can protect you...

773
00:58:05,029 --> 00:58:08,029
...because this is what fighting— this is what we're fighting for.

774
00:58:08,029 --> 00:58:10,029
This is what justice is for! So...

775
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:12,029

I'll never leave my Otomo here. Wait, wait!

778
00:58:21,029 --> 00:58:23,029
No, you should come with me!

779
00:58:23,029 --> 00:58:25,029
Come on, let's run, let's run!

780
00:58:25,029 --> 00:58:28,029
Oh! Oh, you— you don't want to?

781
00:58:28,029 --> 00:58:30,029
Are you so scared? Are you— you can't come with me?

782
00:58:30,029 --> 00:58:34,029
It's okay. I might not be able to help *this* Otomo, but I can sure help *you*!

783
00:58:34,029 --> 00:58:37,029
Hah! Come on, come on, come on!

784
00:58:37,029 --> 00:58:40,029
Come on, come on, come on! Let's run!

785
00:58:40,029 --> 00:58:46,029
Oh no, you're limping! Come on!

786
00:58:46,029 --> 00:59:40,029

Ah, I'm so excited! Oh...

791
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:07,058
My car!

792
01:00:09,555 --> 01:00:10,668
No!

793
01:00:10,968 --> 01:00:12,985
No, we've gone through so much together.

794
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:14,458
How could this...

795
01:00:14,458 --> 01:00:15,661
Wait, a water gun!

796
01:00:15,825 --> 01:00:17,455
I can save you! I can save you!

797
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:19,628
No, no, I won't let it end like this!

798
01:00:23,155 --> 01:00:24,988
Oh, well that was easy.

799
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:27,468

01:00:45,855 --> 01:00:48,661
And then you put the socks into the Otomo, into the pouch,

806
01:00:48,661 --> 01:00:52,155
and then you buy seven of these so you have socks for every day of the week.

807
01:00:52,155 --> 01:00:54,988
And then you get seven of these too because it's one... two-in-one!

808
01:00:55,058 --> 01:00:58,561
Technically I guess three-in-one because it's two soc- Oh yeah!

821
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:36,568
we're going to have to sing a song, shall we?

822
01:01:36,755 --> 01:01:39,628
But after the song, there's one more...

823
01:01:39,985 --> 01:01:44,458

824

Come on, I feel like there's something about this song.

833
01:02:16,055 --> 01:02:19,985
It's like we knew how it would go all along.

834
01:02:19,985 --> 01:02:23,555
So put down your worries and raise your cups.

835
01:02:23,555 --> 01:02:26,655
There's nowhere to go but up!

836
01:02:26,655 --> 01:02:30,155
Let's dance with the rhythm from New York to Japan,

837
01:02:30,155 --> 01:02:32,458
and you'll never be alone.

838
01:02:32,555 --> 01:02:36,568
At first glance we're miles away, but our hearts are connected through these soundwaves.

839
01:02:36,655 --> 01:02:40,625
Nothing but up-up-up-up! (Yeah!)

840
01:02:40,655 --> 01:02:44,058

Come put your lights up, we'll make a wave of green.

848
01:03:16,655 --> 01:03:20,058
Bridge the beginning to us all here and now.

849
01:03:20,155 --> 01:03:23,555
Just take a deep breath and let me hear you shout! (Yeah!)

850
01:03:23,655 --> 01:03:27,568
Let's groove with the static in the air.

851
01:03:27,655 --> 01:03:31,058
A breakthrough that can bring us anywhere.

852
01:03:31,155 --> 01:03:34,561
It's your move, so take the lead.

853
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:38,555
From the crowd to the stage, what sights can we see?

854
01:03:38,655 --> 01:03:42,058
Nothing but up-up-up-up! (Yeah!)

855
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:45,561
Cut through the clouds, nothing but up-up-up-up!

856
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,555
We're never coming down! Jump! Jump!

857
01:03:48,655 --> 01:03:52,155
Without a doubt, nothing but up-up-up-up!

858
01:03:52,255 --> 01:03:54,655
Intergalactic Bound!

859
01:04:20,155 --> 01:04:23,561
A thousand little voices sing.

860
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:27,055
It's a fiesta from now on.

861
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:30,568
With your faces always by our side,

862
01:04:30,655 --> 01:04:34,058
to help us make this song.

863
01:04:34,155 --> 01:04:37,555
Through the dark of the night, I know we will be alright.

864
01:04:37,655 --> 01:04:41,058
As a universe of positivity beyond the sky.

865
01:04:41,155 --> 01:04:44,561
Ten thousand of the stars, they will keep on burning bright,

866
01:04:44,655 --> 01:04:48,055
with this light between you and I.

867
01:04:48,155 --> 01:04:51,568
Nothing but up-up-up-up! (Yeah!)

868
01:04:51,655 --> 01:04:55,058
Cut through the clouds, nothing but up-up-up-up!

869
01:04:55,155 --> 01:04:58,561
We're never coming down! Jump! Jump!

870
01:04:58,655 --> 01:05:02,155
Without a doubt, nothing but up-up-up-up!

871
01:05:02,255 --> 01:05:04,655
Intergalactic Bound!

872
01:05:01,296 --> 01:05:02,596
Whoa...

873
01:05:02,596 --> 01:05:03,596
...whoa...

874
01:05:03,596 --> 01:05:05,196
...whoa...

875
01:05:05,496 --> 01:05:06,096
Hey!

876
01:05:06,396 --> 01:05:07,896
Intergalactic bound!

877
01:05:07,896 --> 01:05:09,296
Whoa...

878
01:05:09,296 --> 01:05:10,396
...whoa...

879
01:05:10,396 --> 01:05:11,796
...whoa...

880
01:05:12,196 --> 01:05:12,696
Hey!

881
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:14,596
Intergalactic bound!

882
01:05:36,596 --> 01:05:37,696
Yay!

883
01:05:37,696 --> 01:05:41,096
That was... Ami-go-round's "Intergalactic Bound".

884
01:05:41,296 --> 01:05:42,396
Yay!

885
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:43,796
I hope you liked that.

886
01:05:43,796 --> 01:05:45,496
I really like that song,

887
01:05:45,496 --> 01:05:46,596
so I'm really happy.

888
01:05:46,596 --> 01:05:47,596
Yippee!

889
01:05:47,596 --> 01:05:48,596
Okay, okay.

890
01:05:48,596 --> 01:05:50,496
And now for the... grand announcement.

891
01:05:50,496 --> 01:05:51,396
Yay!

892
01:05:51,396 --> 01:05:53,696
I've been working on this for a while and, um... yeah.

893
01:05:53,696 --> 01:05:55,696
So today, maybe you've seen it already,

894
01:05:55,696 --> 01:05:57,796
there's a waiting room up for it.

895
01:05:58,696 --> 01:06:01,796
Um... I wrote, composed, and produced

896
01:06:01,796 --> 01:06:04,296
my first original song

897
01:06:04,296 --> 01:06:07,696
with the help of Ethra, who's also an amazing producer.

898
01:06:08,696 --> 01:06:10,796
So please, um, wait a little bit longer,

899
01:06:10,796 --> 01:06:12,196
so we are redirected to it,

900
01:06:12,196 --> 01:06:13,596
and then you can listen to it. Yeah,

901
01:06:13,596 --> 01:06:14,696
it's called "Wind Up".

902
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:16,796
So, um, yeah.

903
01:06:16,796 --> 01:06:17,696
I'm very nervous.

904
01:06:17,696 --> 01:06:18,696
I hope you like it.

905
01:06:18,696 --> 01:06:21,596
But um, thank you very much for coming to my 3D showcase today.

906
01:06:21,596 --> 01:06:23,096
It was a lot of fun.

907
01:06:23,096 --> 01:06:24,996
And um, yeah, thank you very much

908
01:06:24,996 --> 01:06:27,796
to staff, management, and everyone,

909
01:06:27,796 --> 01:06:28,796
and all the Otomos.

910
01:06:28,796 --> 01:06:31,296
Wait, I wanted to do one thing.

911
01:06:32,296 --> 01:06:33,396
They love me.

912
01:06:33,396 --> 01:06:34,296
Okay.

913
01:06:37,096 --> 01:06:38,596
Thank you very much.

914
01:06:38,596 --> 01:06:40,396
Okay, wait, let me give you a hug.

915
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:41,296
Mmm.

916
01:06:41,296 --> 01:06:42,496
Okay, okay, that's enough.

917
01:06:42,496 --> 01:06:43,796
Back off, back off, back off.

918
01:06:43,796 --> 01:06:44,996
That's... that's... that's enough.

919
01:06:45,496 --> 01:06:47,496
Okay, well, thank you so much, Otomos!

920
01:06:47,496 --> 01:06:48,596
Thank you everyone!

921
01:06:48,596 --> 01:06:50,396
Thank you for watching my 3D!

922
01:06:51,396 --> 01:06:53,696
Um, maybe we should take care of the fire, huh?

923
01:06:54,696 --> 01:06:55,396
Hmm.

924
01:06:55,396 --> 01:06:56,996
'Cause otherwise, if we don't take care of the fire,

925
01:06:56,996 --> 01:06:59,796
there... there might be a forest fire, you know, for all we know.

926
01:06:59,796 --> 01:07:01,896
Also, don't forget, tomorrow is...

927
01:07:01,896 --> 01:07:03,396
...Raora's 3D!

928
01:07:03,396 --> 01:07:05,196
So you better watch that one as well, okay?

929
01:07:05,196 --> 01:07:06,896
Otherwise, you... you know what's gonna happen.

930
01:07:08,696 --> 01:07:10,396
Don't worry, I know exactly...

931
01:07:10,396 --> 01:07:11,796
...I know exactly...

932
01:07:11,796 --> 01:07:12,696
Oh, my knee!

933
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:15,596
I know exactly what to do to take care of this fire. Okay.

934
01:07:17,196 --> 01:07:18,596
There we go. Easy, easy.

935
01:07:18,596 --> 01:07:18,996
Oh.

936
01:07:20,296 --> 01:07:21,796
Easy, easy.

937
01:07:21,796 --> 01:07:22,196
Oh.

938
01:07:23,196 --> 01:07:24,396
I'm too tired for this.

939
01:07:24,396 --> 01:07:25,696
I'm too... I'm too...

940
01:07:25,696 --> 01:07:26,196
Stop.

941
01:07:27,096 --> 01:07:27,796
Whatever.

942
01:07:28,896 --> 01:07:29,696
Goodbye.

943
01:07:33,296 --> 01:07:35,796
Dearest otomos!
Thank you! Thank you for always supporting me,

944
01:07:35,796 --> 01:07:38,296
for believing in me and cheering for me
throughout all this time!

945
01:07:38,296 --> 01:07:41,296
It's already been a year and I couldn't have asked
for a better community than the one we've built together.

946
01:07:41,296 --> 01:07:44,296
You know, I'm always bad with words but I just want
to say that I am forever grateful for how much joy

947
01:07:44,296 --> 01:07:47,296
you bring me and that I can proudly stand here
today and show you the things we work on

948
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:50,296
with the hope that we can enjoy it together!
I truly wish that I can give back to you

949
01:07:50,296 --> 01:07:53,296
even a fraction of the happiness that you've
given me and make you smile even if it's just

950
01:07:53,296 --> 01:07:56,296
for a while (hey that rhymed)
And to make you slight-breath-out-of-your-nose-laugh!

951
01:07:56,296 --> 01:07:59,296
That would be my biggest goal!
You are my biggest motivation and I hope I can

952
01:07:59,296 --> 01:08:02,296
keep creating distractions on rough days or
entertainment on others and I will keep trying

953
01:08:02,296 --> 01:08:05,296
my very best!
I'm so happy to be here with you!

954
01:08:05,296 --> 01:08:07,296
And I hope we can keep having fun together!
Yours, Cecilia Immergreen

955
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:10,296
Otomo will return

956
01:10:01,176 --> 01:10:47,576
