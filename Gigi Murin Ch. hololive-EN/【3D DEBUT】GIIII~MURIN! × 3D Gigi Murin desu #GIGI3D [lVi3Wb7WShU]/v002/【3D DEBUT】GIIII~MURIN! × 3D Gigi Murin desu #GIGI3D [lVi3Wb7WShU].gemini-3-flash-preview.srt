2
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,500
I'm Gigi Murin.

3
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,000
I used to be 14 years old in 8th grade, but now I'm not!

4
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:48,300
I'm a bit clumsy, crazy and silly, and I may not look it, but actually, I'm a member of Hololive English Justice!

5
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
That's true.

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,500
...call myself the Fister because I fister people with my big big power glyph, and the folks don't really like that I call myself the Fister...

7
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
TWO GREMS AND A SHOEBOX

8
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,000
...literally called the Fister, cause I fist people, you know? You know what I mean?

9
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,800
Today's the day of a very important justice meeting, but I accidentally overslept!

10
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,300
So I have to hurry up and...

11
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,000
...make sure to look both ways before crossing the road, and...

12
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,800
Go! Ah!

13
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,500
GIGI GOES BINTED!

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,500
Ah! Ah! Ouch!

15
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,300
Who was that? That was so weird. Wow.

16
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,200
Where am I?

17
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:50,000
Beautiful 2D fantasy world, I'm so efficient at shipping in my horse car, shipping even bit more than Justice...

18
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,300
I was just hit by a car and it would be really cool... Whoa! What the—

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,200
A horse? That's not a truck!

20
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,800
That's dangerous! I could have died!

21
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,500
But whew, that grem sure knows how to drive.

22
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,800
GREMLIN JU—

23
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,000
Ah!

24
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,000
Ah... Ah... My body hurts.

25
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,800
I feel like I got run over by something...

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,300
...but I don't know what.

27
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,500
Oh! Is that a statue of a grem?

28
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,300
Looks cool!

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,800
Wait a second... I know this!

30
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,800
I've been isekai'd!

31
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,000
What the freak? Gigi, you're here too?

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Justice Cardboard.

33
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,500
Huh? Gigi, what's going on?

34
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,100
Where are we?

35
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,000
(Ouch!)

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,800
What are you guys doing? Why are you cardboard?

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,300
Why does Cece look so sad?

38
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,500
You f***ing c***! How dare you do this to me!

39
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,500
You b****! This is your fault somehow! I don't know how you did this...

40
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,300
...you absolute d***! Oh, you look terrible!

41
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, let's go investigate around here!

42
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,000
Let's go.

43
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay.

44
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,500
I'm on my way! Wait guys! Wait for me! We can have an adventure together!

45
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,500
We have adventure together and it'll be so fun and and...

46
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,000
Wait! Wait! What's going—

47
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,500
Horses!

48
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,200
Two of them!

49
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,700
Goodbye, leaving heartbreak of the past...

50
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,000
...behind. There's no more tears...

51
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,308
Looking back,

52
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:02,508
it's time

53
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:04,508
Moving down our own path

54
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:06,508
Ever voyaging forward

55
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:10,008
to make this journey last

56
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:33,808
Never before in a boundless night

57
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:37,208
Like a promise found riding the wind

58
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,508
Where a mist begins spiraling outward and up

59
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:44,208
An inspiring tale begins

60
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:48,808
We who dare defy changing of times

61
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:52,208
Us who follow unreachable dreams

62
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,708
Know it's here and right now that we're drawn to somehow

63
00:05:55,708 --> 00:06:00,008
Deep inside a will to live that we'll leave

64
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:03,008
Echoes of dreams aching

65
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:06,008
Wandering near and far

66
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:09,608
Touching lives just like ours

67
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:12,708
Blinding fires

68
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:16,008
Till life wastes away

69
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,008
One day

70
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:21,308
I'll recall these nights

71
00:06:21,308 --> 00:06:25,008
Our relentless odyssey

72
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:28,008
Pressing onward

73
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:31,808
We never surrender

74
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:34,008
To the skies

75
00:06:34,008 --> 00:06:39,008
We can rise again

76
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:51,508
Again...

77
00:07:07,508 --> 00:07:11,808
If anything else hits me, I don't think I'll survive much longer.

78
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:14,208
I really need to be more careful.

79
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:17,008
Thank goodness I'm still alive.

80
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:23,508
The winds whispered of your coming...

81
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:28,208
and now, here you are.

82
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:30,508
Who are you?!

83
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:35,508
I am the greatest wizard in all of Grem Kingdom.

84
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:38,208
Wizard Oji-chan.

85
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,508
Wizard Oji-chan?

86
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:42,508
Are you a wizard or Oji-chan?

87
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:43,808
Do you have a name?

88
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:45,508
What should I call you?

89
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:50,508
So many of Grem's warriors have fallen, one by one,

90
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:53,808
while we waited for your arrival...

91
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,808
The wait was worth it!!!

92
00:07:57,008 --> 00:08:02,508
You are far more powerful than I ever imagined a hero could be!

93
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:06,008
He's not responding to me. He's probably an NPC.

94
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:08,508
It's like this is a game? Like a game?

95
00:08:08,808 --> 00:08:10,508
NPC?!

96
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:12,508
NPC!? あ！え！？ NPC！？
NPC!? Ah! Eh!? NPC!?

97
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:14,208
少々お待ちください！
Please wait a moment!

98
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,508
I am the noble wizard,

99
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:19,008
Oji-chan!

100
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:22,008
Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

101
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,008
I'm sorry! I didn't know you could talk!

102
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:26,508
You're the key.

103
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:32,008
Without you, your friend and this world are lost...

104
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:37,508
What? Lost? What are you talking about?

105
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,508
Gigi,

106
00:08:39,508 --> 00:08:41,808
the world is waiting...

107
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:43,208
He knows my name?

108
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:44,508
That's me.

109
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:45,508
I'm the hero.

110
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:51,008
I'm gonna save the world from... from being cardboard.

111
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:54,008
ハッザー！
HAZAH!

112
00:08:57,008 --> 00:08:58,508
Ah! What did you do to me?

113
00:08:58,508 --> 00:08:59,808
It hurts! It hurts!

114
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,508
おかしい...
Strange...

115
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:05,508
Oh, what are you doing? Why... what...?

116
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:07,008
ハッザー！
HAZAH!

117
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,508
Wow, I'm so cute and soft and fluffy now. Friends with you. Purchase next time they're in stock.

118
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,808
もうちょっと... ごめん。
Just a bit more... Sorry.

119
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:19,508
もう一回やらせて。今度ちゃんとやるから。
Let me try one more time. I'll do it right this time.

120
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:21,508
I don't understand.

121
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:22,508
オッケー、オッケー。
OK, OK.

122
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:28,008
ハッザー！
HAZAH!

123
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,208
行くぞ、ジジ！
Here we go, Gigi!

124
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,208
I'm ready!

125
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,208
ジジ！
Gigi!

126
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,008
Gigi!

127
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:43,508
行こう！
Let's go!

128
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:44,208
Body!

129
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,508
ハッザー！
HAZAH!

130
00:09:54,508 --> 00:09:56,508
Oh wait.

131
00:09:56,508 --> 00:10:00,008
I think... I think I can move now!

132
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:02,016
This is...

133
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:03,016
Hands!

134
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,516
You did it!

135
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:06,516
You've done it!

136
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,516
Oh my God! Look how cute I am!

137
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:13,516
Aw! I've always been cute, but now it's even cute...

138
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:17,016
...now everyone can see how cute I am!

139
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,016
Look at that fat tail!

140
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:20,816
I can do everything!

141
00:10:20,816 --> 00:10:22,516
I can't do that.

142
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:24,016
Watch this, guys!

143
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:25,516
You've never seen this before.

144
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:27,516
Okay, okay... whee!

145
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:29,016
Whee!

146
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:31,016
I can do everything!

147
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:33,016
Two in a row? Just kidding.

148
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:34,516
I have a world to save!

149
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:36,516
Look at that, everyone loves me!

150
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:38,016
Gigi Murin!

151
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:51,016
Oh, I'm so dizzy.

152
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:53,016
Oh, I'm so... I'm so sorry, boss.

153
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:57,516
What... what should I do to save everyone?

154
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:04,516
The world is spinning... owie.

155
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:11,516
Before saving everyone, let's see if you can survive basic chores.

156
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:14,016
Basic? I can do basic chores!

157
00:11:15,516 --> 00:11:18,016
Let's start with...

158
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:23,016
Start with what? Start with what?

159
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,516
What? What are we starting with?

160
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:25,516
What? What?

161
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:29,016
A bird! Go away! What?

162
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:31,016
Ouch! Ouch! Wait!

163
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:33,516
What? What? Ouch! Ouch! What are you doing?

164
00:11:34,016 --> 00:11:37,016
What? What are you doing with him? Wait! Wait! No!

165
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:40,016
Don't go! Don't go! Please stop! Wait!

166
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:43,016
Wait! Wait!

167
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:44,516
No! No!

168
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:51,016
The birds took him!

169
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:54,516
I knew I could never trust a bird!

170
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:58,016
Hey you. Come here! Follow me!

171
00:11:58,016 --> 00:11:59,016
A Grem?

172
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:02,516
Um... I have to help my friend.

173
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:06,516
You're scared and lost... Not knowing what to do, right?

174
00:12:07,016 --> 00:12:10,016
I'll show you how to save your friends. Follow me!

175
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:12,016
Oh, okay.

176
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:27,016
This place is weird.

177
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:31,516
This place is dark and it smells bad.

178
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:35,516
Hey it smells good!!!! Do exactly as I say if you want to save your friends!

179
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:39,516
Go to the Grem Kingdom and return with the One Ping, a Honkshoe, and a Straw Hat.

180
00:12:40,016 --> 00:12:41,516
Why do you need them?

181
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:46,016
YOU DON'T GET TO ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS!!! NOW GO GIGI, GOOOOOOO!!

182
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,016
Okay.

183
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:05,516
Whoa! So this is the Grem Kingdom?

184
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:09,516
It's so cool! There's so many Grems!

185
00:13:09,516 --> 00:13:14,516
Does this mean this entire kingdom is mine if I save it?

186
00:13:15,016 --> 00:13:17,516
Whoa, there's so many of you.

187
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:20,016
Oh, not all at once. No, no, no, no.

188
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:21,016
What?

189
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:24,016
Oh, I can't hear you.

190
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:28,016
Let's try this Grem. Lucky little Grem, what's on your mind?

191
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:33,016
Things aren't going well with my partner... I need your help to fix our relationship.

192
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:35,016
Aw, that is not my problem.

193
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,016
Ah, okay.

194
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:41,516
How about this Grem? Do you have anything interesting to say to me?

195
00:13:42,016 --> 00:13:47,516
My tummy is getting very large and I don't know why. Please come with me to the doctor.

196
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:52,016
Okay, a little secret. Pregnant.

197
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:55,516
Okay, how about this one?

198
00:13:56,016 --> 00:13:59,516
Make a contract with me, and become a magical girl!

199
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:02,516
Oh, that is not my problem either.

200
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:05,016
Oh, no, no, no, no. I will not be doing that.

201
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:08,516
I know what happens when you sign a contract.

202
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,516
You should never put your name down on things.

203
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,016
Well, these Grems were useless.

204
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:18,516
I think if I use my RPG knowledge, you're supposed to get information from NPCs...

205
00:14:18,516 --> 00:14:20,516
...at a store.

206
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:24,016
And there's so many stalls near me.

207
00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:26,516
Let's go to this one!

208
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:31,016
So cute!

209
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:32,516
Aw!

210
00:14:32,516 --> 00:14:34,516
Are you a little worker Grem?

211
00:14:34,516 --> 00:14:36,016
Aw!

212
00:14:36,016 --> 00:14:37,516
How much do you make an hour?

213
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:40,016
Do you make enough to survive?

214
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:42,016
Oh, what is this?

215
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,016
For me?

216
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:50,016
Uh, that's decorative hay, not edible...

217
00:14:54,516 --> 00:14:56,516
Can I ask you something?

218
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:59,016
Oh, what is this?

219
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:00,016
- Who's the strongest person around here?
- Where can I get The One Ping?
- Excuse me, where is the bathroom?

220
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,024
...box?

221
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:02,524
Um...

222
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:05,524
Where can I get the One Ping?

223
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:08,524
Oh you are looking for the One Ping?

224
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:13,524
Then, here is the Quest for you! Take this ring and throw it into a volcano to destroy it.

225
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:20,524
This cursed ring holds centuries of anger. To purify it, it must be thrown into a volcano...

226
00:15:20,624 --> 00:15:22,024
...but we fear fire and can't go near it.

227
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:25,524
Okay, yeah, I can do that quest for you.

228
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:30,024
Don't worry, I am the chosen one!

229
00:15:30,824 --> 00:15:32,524
A ring! Wow!

230
00:15:33,524 --> 00:15:35,524
I don't know what a volcano is.

231
00:15:36,024 --> 00:15:38,224
How is this supposed to help me save Justice?

232
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:41,024
They're gonna die! They're gonna die if the volcano erupts!

233
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,524
Oh wait, I don't know what a volcano is.

234
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:46,024
Let's just try to find the One Ping myself.

235
00:15:48,524 --> 00:15:51,524
Wait, this box was a little suspicious.

236
00:15:54,024 --> 00:15:58,524
Hmm... Deliver to weapon shop.

237
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:02,024
Oh, cool! Is this for a quest?

238
00:16:03,524 --> 00:16:04,524
Okay!

239
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:13,524
Hey! I got a package!

240
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:16,524
I got you guys a package! It's a gift from me!

241
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:21,024
I bought this. I'll just leave it right here.

242
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,524
It looks just like the box of the BL novel set I lost! Thank you!

243
00:16:26,824 --> 00:16:28,524
Your BL novels?

244
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:35,524
No, no, no. Don't lose sight of the quest, Gigi.

245
00:16:36,224 --> 00:16:38,524
Whoa! This is a really cool sword!

246
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:42,524
I bet, I bet I could save justice with...

247
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:51,024
Why is this so heavy for cardboard?

248
00:16:51,224 --> 00:16:54,024
Oh my god. I'm gonna put it back.

249
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:58,024
This is why List has so much arm strength. Oh my god.

250
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:04,024
Hahaha! That sword is pretty useless. It can undo cardboardification or something...

251
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,024
This sword's really cool. How much is it?

252
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:13,024
What's that? Five dollars?

253
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:16,524
Uh, I can't afford that.

254
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:22,024
But uh, how about, how about I save them to the power of friendship?

255
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:24,024
Oh, another... another text box.

256
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:27,524
Is the One Ping even real?

257
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:32,024
I present a quest to you! Conquer it, and the One Ping shall be yours!

258
00:17:32,224 --> 00:17:34,024
Would you craft 10 iron bars?

259
00:17:34,224 --> 00:17:36,524
Okay, sounds easy. I can do that.

260
00:17:36,824 --> 00:17:40,524
To craft 10 iron bars, you need to perform a freestyle dance and rap.

261
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:44,224
Gather 10 Grems with your performance to craft 10 iron bars.

262
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:49,024
What? I don't think that's how you craft an iron bar.

263
00:17:50,024 --> 00:17:53,024
Ayo, you set, bro? Show us what you've got!

264
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:58,024
Where'd I get over here? What are these sunglasses?

265
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:04,024
Grems, this beat's kind of nasty. Who let you have this in the shoe shop?

266
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:07,524
Oh, okay. I'm getting it.

267
00:18:08,524 --> 00:18:12,024
Okay, I guess we're really doing this. Okay.

268
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:15,524
Set on a quest to save my friends,

269
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:18,224
I don't really know what rhymes with friends.

270
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:20,524
Old man wizard, take it from me,

271
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:23,024
evil flying birds looking for a treat.

272
00:18:23,224 --> 00:18:26,024
Don't even know if he's alive or not,

273
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:29,024
But who really cares what the pips that I got.

274
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:31,524
Horse girls racing my heart racing,

275
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:34,524
got me by my knees, skill activation.

276
00:18:34,824 --> 00:18:37,524
Then a bunch of Grems surrounded me,

277
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:41,024
asked me to forge some iron bars you see.

278
00:18:41,224 --> 00:18:44,524
Wait a second, starting to realize what you meant by bars.

279
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:48,024
But my rap game is fire, and my dance is not desired.

280
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:52,524
But if there's one thing that I'm not, it's definitely not a liar,

281
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:55,524
so I hope you don't mind if I twerk up on ya, you see.

282
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:58,224
There's a promise that I made to Fauna.

283
00:18:58,524 --> 00:19:02,024
Yeah! Oh, I'm twerking. I don't know how to twerk.

284
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,524
I don't want to put in the work.

285
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:08,524
You see, twerking is a skill you have to, you have to train up for, everyone.

286
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:12,024
And I ran out of rhymes 30 seconds ago.

287
00:19:13,524 --> 00:19:18,024
All right, um... I got dance moves and then...

288
00:19:29,524 --> 00:19:31,024
Mic drop.

289
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:37,024
Yo! Yo! That was amazing!

290
00:19:37,224 --> 00:19:38,224
Really? You liked it?

291
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:40,524
You successfully crafted 10 iron bars!

292
00:19:40,824 --> 00:19:43,524
Yippee! I got that iron bar!

293
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:45,524
Yippee!

294
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:47,524
Yippee!

295
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:49,824
Take this as a reward.

296
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:53,024
Is that, is that what I think it is?

297
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:56,524
The One Ping is real!

298
00:19:57,224 --> 00:20:00,024
Oh, what's my gauntlet? Oh.

299
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,032
Oh, is this yours? I found it down in the sewer.

300
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:08,532
Did I have it?

301
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,032
Did I have them?

302
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:13,032
If you want it back, throw the ring into the volcano.

303
00:20:13,532 --> 00:20:15,532
Oh cool! Thanks! I'm gonna go now.

304
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,532
That ring is truly cursed. Handle it with care, or something terrible might happen.

305
00:20:19,032 --> 00:20:22,032
If you dare throw it away, a ferocious monster will awaken...

306
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:27,532
Ooh, my tummy. I'm so hungry.

307
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:32,032
I can't save Justice like this.

308
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,532
Meat!

309
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:35,532
For me?

310
00:20:35,632 --> 00:20:37,032
For free?

311
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,532
Hey! Who told you you could eat that?!

312
00:20:43,132 --> 00:20:44,532
Whoa, big ass hat.

313
00:20:45,032 --> 00:20:46,532
You... You don't like my hat?

314
00:20:47,532 --> 00:20:50,032
No, no! I think your hat is lovely. I love it.

315
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:53,532
Lovely? Really? You can eat as much meat as you want!

316
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:00,532
Hey, by the way, I'm looking for a straw hat.

317
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:02,532
Any idea where I could find one?

318
00:21:03,532 --> 00:21:04,532
I'll trade it if you complete my quest.

319
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:07,532
Ah, here we go again.

320
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:12,032
I want 26 pictures of giant rats.

321
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:15,532
Giant rats? Where do I find one of those?

322
00:21:16,532 --> 00:21:17,532
Oh! Here they are!

323
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:23,032
Take your camera and capture family photos of all 26 of them!

324
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:27,032
Whoa, is this the family of 26 rats?

325
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:30,532
I guess I can see why you want pictures of them.

326
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:33,532
Okay, it's picture time. I'll get pictures of all 26 of them.

327
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:37,032
Heh, yeah. Get in the frame. Let me get a picture of you.

328
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:42,532
One of them doesn't even look like a rat. That's a really big person.

329
00:21:45,032 --> 00:21:47,532
How about down here? Oh, right, one more, one more.

330
00:21:49,032 --> 00:21:50,532
That's a Grem!

331
00:21:51,032 --> 00:21:54,032
What are you doing? You're not even a rat!

332
00:21:55,532 --> 00:21:58,532
Okay, how about down here? And look at those!

333
00:21:59,032 --> 00:22:00,532
They look just like Justice!

334
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:04,532
If Justice were rats, but they're cardboard.

335
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:09,532
Whoa! Okay, don't worry, I got you. I got every angle imaginable.

336
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,032
That's a computer mouse.

337
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:17,532
And look at this photo I took, and then this one.

338
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:22,032
And this one, it's just so cute. All these rats are so cute.

339
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,532
And this is awesome, and this is a yummy looking rat, yay!

340
00:22:26,532 --> 00:22:28,032
How cute!! I love them!!

341
00:22:28,132 --> 00:22:29,532
Please accept this straw hat!

342
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:34,032
A hat, for me? Yay!

343
00:22:34,532 --> 00:22:38,032
Now I have two items!

344
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:41,532
Oh, the stables are over there.

345
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:44,532
Maybe I can get the honkshoe from the stable.

346
00:22:49,532 --> 00:22:51,532
Ah! Ah!

347
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:55,532
You scared me!

348
00:22:56,532 --> 00:22:58,032
How are you doing?

349
00:22:58,132 --> 00:22:59,532
Is everything going well?

350
00:23:00,032 --> 00:23:01,532
Bad! I'm doing bad!

351
00:23:02,532 --> 00:23:04,032
A few more quests might cheer you up!

352
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,532
You should take the ring to...

353
00:23:07,532 --> 00:23:10,532
It's like no one cares about me.

354
00:23:11,532 --> 00:23:14,032
This cruel evil world...

355
00:23:15,032 --> 00:23:17,032
The stables!

356
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:20,532
Ah, horses. Ah, hello.

357
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:24,032
Hi! Hi there!

358
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:26,532
Hey!

359
00:23:33,032 --> 00:23:34,532
I can share.

360
00:23:35,032 --> 00:23:37,032
Here you go. Eat up.

361
00:23:43,032 --> 00:23:46,032
Is this horse okay?

362
00:23:47,532 --> 00:23:50,032
Oh, no, I think he's sleeping.

363
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:54,032
Okay, I think I can just... don't mind if I... I'll just take this.

364
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:56,032
No need for this to you.

365
00:23:57,532 --> 00:24:00,032
I've done it!

366
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:03,532
I've gathered all three items, by myself!

367
00:24:04,032 --> 00:24:09,532
Yay! I am the hero of this kingdom!

368
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:15,532
Sewer Grem, you probably didn't think I'd get them all.

369
00:24:16,032 --> 00:24:18,532
But I did. I got everything.

370
00:24:19,532 --> 00:24:22,532
Because I am the hero.

371
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,532
Dozo.

372
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:30,032
For you.

373
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:33,532
Oh wow, you really managed to get everything I asked for!

374
00:24:34,532 --> 00:24:37,532
Hold on, wait here. There's something special just for you!

375
00:24:38,532 --> 00:24:40,032
Oh yay!

376
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:49,032
Ah man, can't believe I got everything.

377
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:53,032
Oh, does that mean I saved Justice?

378
00:24:53,532 --> 00:24:59,532
Oh, they're gonna be so proud of me!

379
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
Eh?

380
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,140
Is there something?

381
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,540
No, no, please! No! Don't do it! No! Ahhh!

382
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,240
Owly...

383
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,640
Ow!

384
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,240
Why does this keep happening to me?

385
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,540
Where am I?

386
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,640
What is this?

387
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,240
This isn't my fantasy life.

388
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,540
House?

389
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,040
Where am I going?

390
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,940
What is- ah!

391
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,840
Hey, what's up, how's it going guys?

392
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,440
Oh my gosh, what's up?

393
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,140
What's up everyone?

394
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,540
My name is Bae!

395
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,440
And my name is Biboo!

396
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,840
And together we are... BAEBIBOO!

397
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,940
Welcome, welcome to our Let's Play!

398
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,940
Yes, today we are playing a new game called...

399
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,440
...what is it called?

400
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,840
Uh, Gimms? The Gimm?

401
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,940
The Gimms? The Gimms?

402
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,440
I don't know how it's pronounced.

403
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,940
Something like that. Yeah.

404
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,440
Um, it's a brand new game with the rat...

405
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,440
...look at my move! The alpha!

406
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,940
We are the first ones to touch it.

407
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,140
Thank you, Sak-chan!

408
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,740
So we've got exclusive footage here...

409
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,040
...for you today. Let's get started!

410
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,440
Thank you so much! Let's get started!

411
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,740
So the premise of this game is we've got our character...

412
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,940
Where are you guys at? What are you doing over there?

413
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
...Gigi. Gigi. Is it a Gigi or Gigi?

414
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,440
Biboo!

415
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,240
I probably- I don't know.

416
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,840
And it's kind of like a real-life simulator game.

417
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,540
So if I push this button right here...

418
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,140
...she should be able to sit down.

419
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,940
Let's see. Oh, there we go!

420
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,440
Wait! I didn't do that!

421
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,440
Whoa! The controls!

422
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,440
Let's- let's test them some more.

423
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,440
Let's test out the controls.

424
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,440
Can you make her sit on the sofa?

425
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,940
Um, let's see if she can act like a dog.

426
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,440
You've got that dog in you!

427
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,440
You've got the dog in you! Of course!

428
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,940
Of course people would make me act like a dog.

429
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,540
There's the button! Bar- bar- bark!

430
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,940
Louder!

431
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,940
Whoa, look at those physics!

432
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,740
Oh my god!

433
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,440
Okay, that's enough.

434
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,740
Okay, stand back up.

435
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,940
All right, stand back up.

436
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,440
So this is just the base game, right?

437
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,140
So, you know, there's the- this is the room.

438
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,440
Wait, something weird's going on.

439
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,940
Have you noticed? Something's weird.

440
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,440
So there's four rooms at the moment.

441
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,440
We've got the main living room, the bedroom...

442
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,440
...and the bathroom.

443
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,940
And I think there's a kitchen- attached kitchenette.

444
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,440
Should we go check out the kitchen?

445
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,440
Yeah, let's go see the kitchen! My character!

446
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,740
Move into the kitchen. Come on, Gigi!

447
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,440
I don't want to! I don't want to!

448
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,140
Stop, I don't want to!

449
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,440
Let's see any- anything we can interact with.

450
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,940
Oh look, a knife!

451
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,440
Pick up the knife! Pick it up right now!

452
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,940
What does she have? A knife!

453
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,940
Pick up a knife! Pick up a knife!

454
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,940
Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up!

455
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,440
Why is there so much input lag? I know!

456
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,440
Why is input- oh, there we go! There we go!

457
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,940
Maybe the connection's just a little bit slow.

458
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,940
That's fine.

459
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,440
Now, okay. Now what? You're going to...

460
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,940
...put the knife into the stove?

461
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,740
Yes, into the stove! Into the burning hot stove!

462
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,440
I hope she doesn't stab herself.

463
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,440
Geez, do you think they, uh, accounted for this...

464
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,940
...kind of- oh my god!

465
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,440
Maybe that's something they can add...

466
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,140
...in the next update. That was kind of anticlimactic.

467
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,440
Oh well.

468
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,940
Whoa! Okay, pick up knife again.

469
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,440
Why? Why?

470
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,440
Pick up knife! Always carry a knife.

471
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,440
All right. What are you guys doing to me?

472
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,940
Shall we move into another room?

473
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,740
Yeah, let's check out the other room.

474
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,140
Let's go into door number one! Let's see what's in there.

475
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,140
Whoa!

476
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,440
Walk! Walk forward! Go! Move!

477
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,440
Walk! Walk! Go! Move! Move!

478
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,940
There she goes! Whoo! What is in that door?

479
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,440
Oh, she just clipped through the wall.

480
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,940
Oh, she clipped! Oh, we've got to report that bug.

481
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,140
Oh, clip! Okay, we've got to report that bug.

482
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,440
That's right.

483
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,940
Oh! Oh, there's a bathtub! And there's a toilet!

484
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,440
Oh, there's a bathtub! And there's a toilet!

485
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,140
Oh, oh, there's a- I know, I know!

486
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,140
Have you heard of Skibidi Toilet?

487
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,940
Oh gosh, what is Skibidi Toilet?

488
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,440
All right, I'm going to make the character...

489
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,440
...phase into the toilet...

490
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,440
...with her head sticking out to become...

491
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,940
...Skibidi! Become one with the toilet! NOW!

492
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,440
I don't want to! No! No!

493
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,140
Skibidi Toilet! I learn something new every day.

494
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,040
Skibidi bop bop bop! Yes, yes, yes!

495
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,548
Wow! Okay! Wow!

496
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:03,548
I don't believe it! Turn on notifications!

497
00:30:03,548 --> 00:30:06,548
Yeah! So you don't miss the next episode!

498
00:30:06,548 --> 00:30:08,548
Yeah! Just spin!

499
00:30:08,548 --> 00:30:10,548
There's gonna be more and people!

500
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:13,548
Thank you for watching!

501
00:30:13,548 --> 00:30:16,548
Bye!

502
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:32,048
Thank god.

503
00:30:32,048 --> 00:30:34,248
I don't hear their voices anymore.

504
00:30:34,248 --> 00:30:35,348
Oh thank god.

505
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:38,248
Oh get me out of this toilet...

506
00:30:38,248 --> 00:30:41,248
...everything is skibidi toilet.

507
00:30:41,248 --> 00:30:43,748
First you take over my body...

508
00:30:43,748 --> 00:30:46,548
...then you make me skibidi toilet.

509
00:30:46,548 --> 00:30:48,848
How do I get out of here?

510
00:31:03,048 --> 00:31:06,548
How could they... how could they torture me like this?

511
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:13,248
Why did they make me do all those things?

512
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,548
They didn't even feed me.

513
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:18,548
They didn't even say that I was a good girl...

514
00:31:18,548 --> 00:31:21,048
...after they made me do all those things.

515
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:23,248
And now I'm poor.

516
00:31:25,348 --> 00:31:28,248
I'm gonna take it out on this canvas.

517
00:31:29,248 --> 00:31:33,748
Oh, if I just paint what I want, then maybe I'll be rewarded for it.

518
00:31:33,748 --> 00:31:37,048
Because I am... karma comes to good people.

519
00:31:37,048 --> 00:31:39,048
So... beautiful woman...

520
00:31:39,048 --> 00:31:40,248
boobs.

521
00:31:40,248 --> 00:31:41,048
Yes.

522
00:31:41,048 --> 00:31:45,348
Yes!

523
00:31:45,348 --> 00:31:46,848
I've done it.

524
00:31:46,848 --> 00:31:48,548
My greatest work yet.

525
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:50,048
My painting.

526
00:31:58,848 --> 00:31:59,848
Hello?

527
00:32:00,848 --> 00:32:02,048
Gigi?

528
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,548
Hello? Knock knock.

529
00:32:06,848 --> 00:32:08,048
Are you in there?

530
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:10,048
Okay, I'm gonna come in.

531
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:13,248
Oh my goodness.

532
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:17,348
This absolute masterpiece.

533
00:32:17,348 --> 00:32:22,048
One of the lost works of Picasso? Or no?

534
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:24,048
It has to be Leonardo da Vinci.

535
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:27,548
It's so incredible. I've never seen anything like it.

536
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:35,248
I can't believe that something like this is before my own eyes.

537
00:32:36,048 --> 00:32:37,048
Gigi!

538
00:32:37,048 --> 00:32:38,248
Gigi, wake up!

539
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,548
Gigi, wake up!

540
00:32:43,348 --> 00:32:45,048
Gigi, are you alright?

541
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:47,048
Something attacked me...

542
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,548
I don't know what...

543
00:32:48,548 --> 00:32:50,048
Why are you screaming?

544
00:32:51,548 --> 00:32:53,048
Oh, beautiful woman.

545
00:32:53,048 --> 00:32:56,848
Yes, it's me. I came over just like you invited me to.

546
00:32:56,848 --> 00:32:58,548
Nerissa Ravencroft?

547
00:32:58,548 --> 00:33:00,848
Is that you? And not a painting?

548
00:33:01,248 --> 00:33:04,248
No, but did you make this, Gigi?

549
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,548
I made this.

550
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:07,548
It's incredible. Do you like it?

551
00:33:08,248 --> 00:33:10,048
I do.

552
00:33:10,048 --> 00:33:13,248
In fact, I thought of you while making it. Can you tell?

553
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:17,548
I can. In fact, if it's so that I'm your muse...

554
00:33:17,548 --> 00:33:19,548
...maybe we could be together?

555
00:33:19,548 --> 00:33:20,548
Really?

556
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:22,548
Yes. No one's ever said that to me.

557
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:26,348
I swore... I've never wanted anything quite as much.

558
00:33:26,348 --> 00:33:31,048
After seeing this painting, the fire of my heart has been inflamed...

559
00:33:31,048 --> 00:33:34,048
...and I feel like I cannot live without you, Gigi Murin.

560
00:33:45,348 --> 00:33:46,848
Don't scream now.

561
00:33:46,848 --> 00:33:48,348
You're tickling me.

562
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:53,048
You know what? I've thought a lot of thinking. Thought thought about thinking.

563
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:55,348
I've thought of it. And I've come up with a thing.

564
00:33:57,048 --> 00:33:58,548
We should get married.

565
00:33:59,048 --> 00:34:01,048
Oh, I thought you'd never ask!

566
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:02,048
Really?

567
00:34:02,048 --> 00:34:03,048
Really?

568
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:04,548
Why would you think that?

569
00:34:04,548 --> 00:34:05,848
Do you want me?

570
00:34:05,848 --> 00:34:07,548
I want you so bad.

571
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:13,048
You have no idea how bad I want you.

572
00:34:14,248 --> 00:34:15,548
Let's go...

573
00:34:16,548 --> 00:34:18,848
...let's go consummate our marriage.

574
00:34:19,048 --> 00:34:20,048
Why?

575
00:34:20,048 --> 00:34:21,048
What?

576
00:34:21,048 --> 00:34:23,048
I don't know if I'm ready for that.

577
00:34:23,048 --> 00:34:24,048
I don't know.

578
00:34:24,048 --> 00:34:25,548
I don't know!

579
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:30,548
そう簡単じゃないのにずっと
It's not that easy, but forever

580
00:34:31,048 --> 00:34:33,548
揺ら揺ら 散々 消える散々
Swaying, terribly, disappearing terribly

581
00:34:34,048 --> 00:34:37,048
今から 緞帳 下がる 散々
From now on, the curtain falls, terribly

582
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:41,048
静かな 愛情 あとにサヨナラ
Quiet affection, then goodbye

583
00:34:41,048 --> 00:34:42,548
静かな 愛情 あとにサヨナラ
Quiet affection, then goodbye

585
00:34:57,548 --> 00:35:00,048
言いかけてた言葉が一つ消えて
A word I was about to say has vanished

586
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,356
止まらないで またタップダンス
Don't stop, tap dance again.

587
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:04,256
亡く身失うまで 逆転劇を繰る
Until our bodies are lost, play out the reversal drama.

588
00:35:04,256 --> 00:35:07,756
舌が乾いた心にも 吐き出すように込めて
Pour it into the heart with a dry tongue as if spitting it out.

589
00:35:07,756 --> 00:35:11,356
胸の中 香りのように濁る
Inside my chest, it grows cloudy like a scent.

590
00:35:11,356 --> 00:35:14,656
受け止めた一言が自分さえ
Even the single word I accepted...

591
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:18,556
抱えられず持て余した それを守っている
...I couldn't handle it, yet I'm protecting it.

592
00:35:18,556 --> 00:35:22,456
掠れた声は空々しく 喉は焼けて埋め尽くす
The raspy voice is hollow, and my throat is burning and filled.

593
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:25,856
何を言うべきか 分からなくて
I don't know what to say.

594
00:35:25,856 --> 00:35:29,356
感じてたものが 今解き放たれていた
What I was feeling has now been released.

595
00:35:29,356 --> 00:35:32,656
同じ様に違う なんだか違う
It's the same, yet different. Somehow, it's different.

596
00:35:32,656 --> 00:35:36,456
いつまで行こうか 何処まで行けるのか
How long shall we go? How far can we go?

597
00:35:36,456 --> 00:35:40,056
左様かじゃないなら 何を思うの
If it's not "is that so," then what are you thinking?

598
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:42,056
僕らが離れるのなら
If we are to part...

599
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,156
僕らが望むのなら
...if that's what we desire...

600
00:35:44,156 --> 00:35:47,356
その度に何回も 繋がれるように
...then so that we can be connected many times over.

601
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:49,256
ここに引き留めるのなら
If I'm to keep you here...

602
00:35:49,256 --> 00:35:51,256
離さず居られるのなら
...if I can stay without letting go...

603
00:35:51,256 --> 00:35:55,656
まだ誰も知らない 感覚ですら割れていく
...then even sensations no one knows yet will split apart.

604
00:36:54,056 --> 00:36:55,556

608
00:37:23,056 --> 00:37:25,556
いつまで続くだろうと
I wonder how long it will last...

609
00:37:26,056 --> 00:37:28,856
同じ様に同じ様に呟く
...I murmur in the same way, in the same way.

610
00:37:29,056 --> 00:37:32,256
今は忘れないよう 刻まれた空気を
Right now, so I don't forget, the atmosphere carved here...

611
00:37:33,456 --> 00:37:36,556
これから何度も 思い出すのだろう
...I'll probably remember it many times from now on.

612
00:37:37,056 --> 00:37:38,256
僕らだけだ
It's just us.

613
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,856
僕らが離れるのなら
If we are to part...

614
00:37:40,856 --> 00:37:42,556
僕らが望むのなら
...if that's what we desire...

615
00:37:43,056 --> 00:37:45,656
その度に何回も 繋がれるように
...then so that we can be connected many times over.

616
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,856
ここに引き留めるのなら
If I'm to keep you here...

617
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:49,856
離さず居られるのなら
...if I can stay without letting go...

618
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:53,056
まだ誰も知らない 感覚僕の
...even my sensations that no one knows yet...

619
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:55,556
生きてる姿を
...my living form...

620
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:58,256
確かめて正しくして
...confirm it and make it right.

621
00:38:21,356 --> 00:38:26,556
Oh husband, I'm so happy to be living a domestic life with you Gigi Murin...

622
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:31,056
...well, in your awesome house, with your awesome kitchen...

623
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:36,056
...and your awesome floor, and this awesome couch.

624
00:38:36,556 --> 00:38:37,756
Wife.

625
00:38:38,256 --> 00:38:39,556
Husband.

626
00:38:41,056 --> 00:38:43,756
I've never been married before.

627
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:45,356
Me neither.

628
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,856
What am I supposed to do?

629
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:48,556
How am I supposed to take care of you?

630
00:38:48,556 --> 00:38:49,556
Take care of me?

631
00:38:49,556 --> 00:38:52,556
You're so sweet, no one's ever wanted to do that.

632
00:38:52,556 --> 00:38:54,256
I want to take care of you.

633
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:56,556
Oh! I've dreamed of this forever...

634
00:38:56,556 --> 00:38:57,856
...and ever...

635
00:38:57,856 --> 00:38:59,056
...and ever...

636
00:38:59,056 --> 00:39:00,556
...and ever...

637
00:39:00,556 --> 00:39:01,356
Oh my goodness!

638
00:39:01,356 --> 00:39:03,556
Oh! Gigi Murin!

639
00:39:03,556 --> 00:39:05,556
Please, not in front of...

640
00:39:05,556 --> 00:39:08,556
...not in front of the studio audience!

641
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:12,756
Oh, my beautiful, beautiful wife.

642
00:39:12,756 --> 00:39:14,656
How far does your leg go up?

643
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:17,556
Oh! As far as you want it to!

644
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:21,056
I see. That's enough.

645
00:39:21,556 --> 00:39:23,556
Oh, not in front of the studio audience.

646
00:39:23,556 --> 00:39:25,056
Not in front of the studio audience.

647
00:39:25,256 --> 00:39:26,556
I can't believe you did that.

648
00:39:26,556 --> 00:39:27,556
Me?

649
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:31,556
If you say so husband, I can't believe I'm such a dirty dirty girl...

650
00:39:31,556 --> 00:39:34,056
...in front of this audience and everything.

651
00:39:34,056 --> 00:39:37,056
That's only for me, my dirty dirty girl.

652
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:42,056
Yes, I wouldn't want anyone else to see me like that but you.

653
00:39:42,556 --> 00:39:44,056
I should do something for you.

654
00:39:44,056 --> 00:39:47,056
That is what a Gigi Murin should do.

655
00:39:47,656 --> 00:39:49,556
Yes, I would love that.

656
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:51,556
I should make you some toast.

657
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,256
Some toast for me?

658
00:39:53,656 --> 00:39:54,856
Yes, for you!

659
00:39:55,056 --> 00:39:56,556
You're so sweet.

660
00:39:57,056 --> 00:39:59,056
Have you ever cooked before?

661
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:01,264
No, never.

662
00:40:01,264 --> 00:40:01,864
Never.

663
00:40:01,864 --> 00:40:04,264
Never. I don't even know how to use a microwave.

664
00:40:04,264 --> 00:40:05,064
Really?

665
00:40:05,064 --> 00:40:06,064
Yes, really.

666
00:40:06,064 --> 00:40:09,564
Well, I only have one thing here and it's toast.

667
00:40:09,564 --> 00:40:11,864
Wow, you're so amazing.

668
00:40:11,864 --> 00:40:14,264
Did you make the bread yourself too?

669
00:40:14,264 --> 00:40:15,164
I made it.

670
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:16,864
Whoa!

671
00:40:16,864 --> 00:40:19,464
Oh, it's been on the floor, that's even better!

672
00:40:19,464 --> 00:40:21,064
You stepped there.

673
00:40:21,064 --> 00:40:23,564
Watch me, watch me flip it, okay?

674
00:40:23,564 --> 00:40:24,864
Yes, yes, I'm watching.

675
00:40:26,564 --> 00:40:28,064
Watch, watch this.

676
00:40:32,064 --> 00:40:35,064
Wait, wait, I have a solution. Okay, flip it!

677
00:40:37,064 --> 00:40:38,264
Yes!

678
00:40:38,264 --> 00:40:39,564
You're amazing!

679
00:40:39,564 --> 00:40:41,564
Oh... Ah, that made me really hungry.

680
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,264
Do you mind if I eat this toast first?

681
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:45,564
Of course you can.

682
00:40:45,564 --> 00:40:47,064
Really? You're such a sweetheart, why?

683
00:40:51,564 --> 00:40:53,064
That looks tasty.

684
00:40:55,564 --> 00:40:57,064
I have to use the bathroom, my sweet.

685
00:40:57,064 --> 00:40:58,264
Oh, of course.

686
00:40:58,264 --> 00:41:00,064
By all means, anything you need.

687
00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:07,464
If I look through the doorknob hole...

688
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:10,564
I can see Gigi on the toilet.

689
00:41:13,264 --> 00:41:15,564
Oh Gigi, I just have to tell you...

690
00:41:15,564 --> 00:41:19,464
These last few hours together have been absolute domestic bliss.

691
00:41:19,464 --> 00:41:23,564
I don't think there's any moment in my life that has been as amazing as this.

692
00:41:29,064 --> 00:41:30,864
Are you still in there?

693
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:32,064
Oh, sorry.

694
00:41:32,464 --> 00:41:33,864
How's the toast?

695
00:41:34,064 --> 00:41:36,264
It's really good, I wish you could try some.

696
00:41:37,064 --> 00:41:39,564
Oh yeah, me too. Maybe next time.

697
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:43,064
I made this for you so I just had... what if it was poisoned, you know?

698
00:41:43,064 --> 00:41:44,264
So I had to check.

699
00:41:44,264 --> 00:41:45,864
You're so thoughtful.

700
00:41:46,064 --> 00:41:49,064
Well, Nerissa Ravencroft, I've been doing a lot of thinking while I was on the toilet.

701
00:41:49,064 --> 00:41:50,064
Yes.

702
00:41:50,064 --> 00:41:51,564
And I don't...

703
00:41:52,564 --> 00:41:53,564
Yes.

704
00:41:53,564 --> 00:41:55,564
I don't know...

705
00:41:57,064 --> 00:41:58,064
Yes.

706
00:41:58,064 --> 00:42:00,064
Don't say another word.

707
00:42:00,064 --> 00:42:02,064
I don't know what a family entails.

708
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:04,064
I completely understand.

709
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,264
Will you be able to teach me?

710
00:42:06,264 --> 00:42:09,064
Of course, I can teach you anything.

711
00:42:09,064 --> 00:42:10,064
Really?

712
00:42:10,064 --> 00:42:14,564
Of course, I'm a ten-thousand-year-old demon. We can do anything you want together.

713
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:16,264
You can teach me anything?

714
00:42:16,264 --> 00:42:17,564
Anything.

715
00:42:17,864 --> 00:42:19,064
Anything?

716
00:42:19,064 --> 00:42:20,064
Anything.

717
00:42:20,064 --> 00:42:21,264
Anything?

718
00:42:21,264 --> 00:42:22,564
Anything.

719
00:42:22,564 --> 00:42:24,564
Anything your heart desires.

720
00:42:27,064 --> 00:42:30,564
Well, I shouldn't keep my beautiful wife waiting.

721
00:42:30,564 --> 00:42:31,564
Yes.

722
00:42:31,564 --> 00:42:33,064
But I have a tummy ache.

723
00:42:33,064 --> 00:42:34,064
You have a tummy ache.

724
00:42:34,064 --> 00:42:35,264
Will you wait for me?

725
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:37,264
Of course, I'll wait forever for you.

726
00:42:39,064 --> 00:42:40,564
Okay, hold on.

727
00:42:40,564 --> 00:42:41,064
Okay.

728
00:42:41,064 --> 00:42:43,564
I don't think I should be eating this toast all by myself.

729
00:42:43,564 --> 00:42:44,264
Don't worry.

730
00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:46,264
Let me slide it under the door for you.

731
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:47,064
Oh, yeah.

732
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,064
Okay.

733
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:51,064
Oh wow.

734
00:42:55,564 --> 00:42:57,264
Is it good?

735
00:42:57,264 --> 00:42:58,564
So delicious!

736
00:42:58,564 --> 00:42:59,564
Is it tasty?

737
00:42:59,564 --> 00:43:00,864
It's so tasty!

738
00:43:00,864 --> 00:43:02,264
Skibidi Toilet.

739
00:43:03,064 --> 00:43:06,064
Never has there been bread made this amazing.

740
00:43:08,564 --> 00:43:11,564
I'm glad that I made such a beautiful toast for you.

741
00:43:11,564 --> 00:43:12,564
Me too.

742
00:43:12,564 --> 00:43:13,564
Hey!

743
00:43:13,564 --> 00:43:15,064
I finished it all.

744
00:43:15,064 --> 00:43:16,264
All of it?

745
00:43:16,264 --> 00:43:18,064
All of it, it's all in my stomach.

746
00:43:18,064 --> 00:43:19,264
Was it really yummy?

747
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,564
So delicious.

748
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:21,864
I'm glad.

749
00:43:21,864 --> 00:43:25,064
Me too. I was really, really nervous, I still am nervous...

750
00:43:25,064 --> 00:43:27,564
...because you're so, you're so beautiful.

751
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:29,264
And I'm just a little guy on a toilet.

752
00:43:29,264 --> 00:43:30,264
A little guy.

753
00:43:30,264 --> 00:43:33,264
And I have a tummy ache and there's just so much wrong with me.

754
00:43:33,264 --> 00:43:34,264
Well don't worry.

755
00:43:34,264 --> 00:43:36,564
But you, there's everything right with you.

756
00:43:36,564 --> 00:43:38,264
But that's how I feel about you.

757
00:43:38,264 --> 00:43:39,264
Really?

758
00:43:39,264 --> 00:43:42,564
With me everything is wrong, but when we're together, everything is perfect.

759
00:43:45,064 --> 00:43:46,564
My love, why are you crying?

760
00:43:46,564 --> 00:43:51,064
No one's ever said that to me before.

761
00:43:51,064 --> 00:43:52,564
Oh, Gigi.

762
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:56,564
I'm sick and tired of these walls separating us. Nerissa, come in here!

763
00:43:56,564 --> 00:43:58,564
Let's break them down!

764
00:43:58,564 --> 00:44:00,564
Sit on my lap, Nerissa.

765
00:44:00,564 --> 00:44:02,564
Sit on your lap? I will.

766
00:44:02,564 --> 00:44:06,064
Anything you ask for, I will do.

767
00:44:06,064 --> 00:44:10,564
How about though we move from this porcelain... whatever it is?

768
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,564
My porcelain throne?

769
00:44:11,564 --> 00:44:14,564
Yeah, and we move somewhere a little more comfortable.

770
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:15,564
Okay, well, I'm done.

771
00:44:15,564 --> 00:44:16,564
Yeah?

772
00:44:19,564 --> 00:44:21,064
I washed my hands.

773
00:44:21,064 --> 00:44:22,064
No.

774
00:44:22,064 --> 00:44:24,064
Okay, it's better this way.

775
00:44:24,064 --> 00:44:25,564
Let's hold hands.

776
00:44:25,564 --> 00:44:26,564
Yes, let's hold hands.

777
00:44:26,564 --> 00:44:28,064
Hold my hand.

778
00:44:28,064 --> 00:44:29,064
I'm holding your hand.

779
00:44:29,064 --> 00:44:30,864
Let's go to the bedroom together.

780
00:44:30,864 --> 00:44:31,564
Yeah, to the bedroom.

781
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,564
Well Gigi, what's the matter?

782
00:44:45,564 --> 00:44:47,064
I'm shy.

783
00:44:47,064 --> 00:44:49,064
Don't be shy.

784
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:51,564
I've never done this before!

785
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:56,564
You know Gigi, the truth is... I know I said I'd teach you anything, but I've never done this before either.

786
00:44:56,564 --> 00:44:57,564
Really?

787
00:44:57,564 --> 00:44:59,564
Then how are we supposed to do it if you've never...

788
00:45:00,672 --> 00:45:03,072
Never done such a thing before. Who's gonna teach me?

789
00:45:03,172 --> 00:45:05,072
We're going to learn together.

790
00:45:05,172 --> 00:45:06,872
You can just learn from nothing?

791
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:07,772
Of course.

792
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,572
That's some... you can just do that?

793
00:45:09,672 --> 00:45:12,672
We'll find it out. How do you think the first humans learned things, Gigi?

794
00:45:12,772 --> 00:45:14,072
I don't know!

795
00:45:14,372 --> 00:45:16,172
Why are you asking me that?

796
00:45:16,872 --> 00:45:19,472
Philosophical? It's pillow talk. Anyway.

797
00:45:19,572 --> 00:45:20,972
Oh, oh, okay. Well...

798
00:45:21,372 --> 00:45:22,372
Shall we?

799
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:25,572
Well, now that you've brought it up... um...

800
00:45:25,872 --> 00:45:29,572
...the first humans probably learned things by doing them.

801
00:45:30,072 --> 00:45:31,072
Yes.

802
00:45:31,372 --> 00:45:33,272
So let's just do it then.

803
00:45:33,372 --> 00:45:34,072
Okay!

804
00:45:34,272 --> 00:45:36,572
I can't wait another moment.

805
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:50,872
Nerissa Ravencroft, you monster!

806
00:45:50,972 --> 00:45:53,372
Oh, I'm sorry! I was trying to be really gentle.

807
00:45:54,472 --> 00:45:55,372
You did great.

808
00:45:55,472 --> 00:45:56,072
Really?

809
00:45:56,172 --> 00:45:57,672
Yes, it was amazing.

810
00:45:59,872 --> 00:46:03,072
Well, I'm glad that we could spend our first day in the bedroom together...

811
00:46:03,172 --> 00:46:05,172
...as a married couple.

812
00:46:05,372 --> 00:46:08,572
Yes, but Gigi, there's something strange going on.

813
00:46:08,872 --> 00:46:10,972
Did you transfer your stomachache to me?

814
00:46:11,072 --> 00:46:13,972
I don't think so. You can't just give a tummy ache to someone with the toast.

815
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,672
But it really, it really hurts. Maybe you need to use the bathroom?

816
00:46:16,872 --> 00:46:18,972
I don't think so, but oh...

817
00:46:19,472 --> 00:46:21,072
Gigi!

818
00:46:21,572 --> 00:46:22,872
Wait a moment.

819
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:24,972
Gigi, your fingers!

820
00:46:25,572 --> 00:46:27,172
No! No!

821
00:46:28,072 --> 00:46:29,872
No, I'm not ready! I'm not ready!

822
00:46:29,972 --> 00:46:31,172
You know...

823
00:46:31,272 --> 00:46:33,572
...you forgot to wear both gloves!

824
00:46:34,072 --> 00:46:35,372
No!

825
00:46:35,572 --> 00:46:36,572
How is it...

826
00:46:36,772 --> 00:46:39,172
I can't... we can't!

827
00:46:39,272 --> 00:46:41,072
We don't have the money!

828
00:46:42,272 --> 00:46:43,772
Gigi, I'm sorry!

829
00:46:43,872 --> 00:46:45,172
Gigi, I can't tell you...

830
00:46:45,372 --> 00:46:47,472
...this house is barely holding together!

831
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:48,872
Gigi, it hurts!

832
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:49,772
Doctor!

833
00:46:50,072 --> 00:46:51,572
Doctor!

834
00:46:53,072 --> 00:46:54,372
Doctor! Doctor, please!

835
00:46:54,672 --> 00:46:56,572
My wife, she's in pain! Can you please help her?

836
00:46:57,172 --> 00:46:58,672
Please, doctor! Please!

837
00:46:59,072 --> 00:47:00,172
Please!

838
00:47:00,672 --> 00:47:02,072
Please help me!

839
00:47:09,672 --> 00:47:11,072
What? Hello?

840
00:47:11,172 --> 00:47:12,372
Are you gonna help her?

841
00:47:12,472 --> 00:47:13,172
Hello?

842
00:47:13,272 --> 00:47:14,372
Why are you laughing?

843
00:47:14,472 --> 00:47:15,572
I'm giving birth here!

844
00:47:15,672 --> 00:47:18,072
She's literally... she is literally giving birth...

845
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:20,072
...and you are just laughing at her!

846
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:21,072
Yeah!

847
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,572
What kind of doctor... I'm gonna go on the internet...

848
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:24,472
...and leave bad reviews about you!

849
00:47:24,572 --> 00:47:26,572
Your days are numbered! You're going out of business...

850
00:47:26,672 --> 00:47:28,072
...and you're gonna go bankrupt and...

851
00:47:28,272 --> 00:47:29,572
Gigi! Gigi, the baby!

852
00:47:29,672 --> 00:47:30,572
Oh no!

853
00:47:30,872 --> 00:47:32,272
It won't wait another minute!

854
00:47:46,472 --> 00:47:47,872
Gigi! I got it!

855
00:47:48,572 --> 00:47:49,772
She's safe!

856
00:47:50,572 --> 00:47:52,072
Oh, our child!

857
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:53,372
It's our baby.

858
00:47:53,472 --> 00:47:55,172
It's a beautiful egg.

859
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,172
It is such a beautiful egg. Wow.

860
00:47:57,472 --> 00:47:59,372
We didn't need a doctor after all. You're a natural.

861
00:47:59,872 --> 00:48:01,372
You're so good at that.

862
00:48:04,372 --> 00:48:06,672
It seems like we're both a natural at a lot of things.

863
00:48:06,772 --> 00:48:07,772
Yes. Wow.

864
00:48:08,572 --> 00:48:10,572
You know, I'm a little impatient.

865
00:48:10,772 --> 00:48:12,772
I kind of wonder, what are you?

866
00:48:12,872 --> 00:48:13,872
What are you in there?

867
00:48:14,072 --> 00:48:15,572
Hello? Hey!

868
00:48:16,872 --> 00:48:18,372
Are you gonna just shake the baby?

869
00:48:18,472 --> 00:48:19,472
Yeah!

870
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:20,972
Wake up!

871
00:48:22,572 --> 00:48:24,072
Oh my god!

872
00:48:24,372 --> 00:48:25,872
It's our son!

873
00:48:26,572 --> 00:48:27,572
Our son!

874
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,872
Oh, he's so cute!

875
00:48:30,572 --> 00:48:32,872
Let's... let's let them hold the baby. Yes.

876
00:48:33,472 --> 00:48:35,472
Should we name him? Should we name him?

877
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,872
You're not gonna hold it like a mommy?

878
00:48:39,072 --> 00:48:40,572
Should we name him?

879
00:48:40,772 --> 00:48:42,572
Yeah, we should name him.

880
00:48:42,672 --> 00:48:44,272
Maybe we should let them name him.

881
00:48:44,372 --> 00:48:45,372
Them?

882
00:48:45,472 --> 00:48:46,072
Them?

883
00:48:46,172 --> 00:48:47,072
Them out there?

884
00:48:47,172 --> 00:48:48,372
Them out there!

885
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:49,072
Them out...

886
00:48:49,372 --> 00:48:51,672
Yeah! They've been watching us this whole time, you know.

887
00:48:51,772 --> 00:48:53,072
What?

888
00:48:53,172 --> 00:48:55,772
Do you guys have an idea to name our baby?

889
00:48:55,872 --> 00:48:57,072
They've been watch...

890
00:48:57,172 --> 00:48:57,872
What?

891
00:48:58,272 --> 00:48:59,372
...give birth?

892
00:48:59,772 --> 00:49:02,172
They're giving name suggestions. What?

893
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,172
Yeah!

894
00:49:03,272 --> 00:49:06,172
Those are some great suggestions. What do you think?

895
00:49:06,272 --> 00:49:07,572
They're all terrible.

896
00:49:07,672 --> 00:49:08,572
Oh.

897
00:49:08,672 --> 00:49:09,972
I'm going to name it Nerigigi.

898
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,272
Nerigigi.

899
00:49:11,372 --> 00:49:13,572
Yeah, because it's like your name and then my name...

900
00:49:13,672 --> 00:49:15,572
...and together and now...

901
00:49:15,872 --> 00:49:17,372
It's perfect!

902
00:49:17,472 --> 00:49:20,572
It's just a happy family. Just you, me, Nerigigi.

903
00:49:20,672 --> 00:49:23,572
And then now you're a beautiful mother...

904
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:26,572
...and now I'm also a beautiful father.

905
00:49:27,072 --> 00:49:28,472
What else can we do?

906
00:49:29,072 --> 00:49:31,572
I don't know, maybe you should go somewhere else...

907
00:49:31,672 --> 00:49:33,472
...while I take care of the baby.

908
00:49:41,372 --> 00:49:42,572
Okay.

909
00:49:46,872 --> 00:49:50,072
Yoshi yoshi yoshi yoshi...
There, there, there, there...

910
00:49:57,672 --> 00:49:59,272
Why are you still watching me? Go away!

911
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,580
Go away!

912
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,580
Better get the mail for my wife.

913
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,280
I think giving birth is really expensive.

914
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,080
I'll have to pay the bills.

915
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,380
I don't have any money though.

916
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,580
God, I hope these aren't bills.

917
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,580
Help!

918
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,580
I don't have my—

919
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,880
Hey! What's happening?

920
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,580
Wait. Did you... Did you leave your controller on?

921
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,580
Oh, maybe I like dropped on the floor and the controller like...

922
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,580
Wait, I'm not touching the controller. Wait, um...

923
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,880
Wait, she's going for the ladder. Wait, take it out. Take it out.

924
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:50,080
No... The liquid of water is filling your lungs.

925
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,080
The air is slowly moving out of your body. You are drowning, honey.

926
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,580
Wait, she's kind of cute though.

927
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,080
Oh my god, wait. What's happening? Oh my god. Did you see that?

928
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,580
Uh, is the house on fire?

929
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,580
My house might be on fire. Oh, whatever. It's fine.

930
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,580
And it's filling your lungs with water. You are slowly suffocating from the inside. Haha.

931
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,580
I hear the inner monologue. Haha.

932
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,580
Bae, help me!

933
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,580
I think there is a... quiz function!

934
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,080
I think it's like if maybe like this character can like answer the quiz correctly...

935
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,580
...the ladder will come back as a prize.

936
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,080
Too much water!

937
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:31,580
Oh! Hello. Are you ready for the quiz?

938
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,580
Hi! Are you ready for the quiz?

939
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,580
Are you ready?

940
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,080
Let me out!

941
00:51:37,080 --> 00:52:20,080
What is the name of the hypothetical particle that mediates the force of gravity in quantum field theory, and has not yet been observed experimentally?
A. Photon
B. Gluon
C. Graviton
D. Neutrino

942
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:42,580
What is the name of the hypothetical particle that mediates the force of gravity in quantum field theory...

943
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,580
What are you saying?

944
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,080
...and has not yet been observed experimentally?

945
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,080
What are you saying to me?

946
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,080

947
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,580

Gluon? Help! Gluon?

949
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,580
C. Graviton or D. Neutrino.

950
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,080
I'm drowning in here!

951
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,080
Please answer correctly or else you will die.

952
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,580
Wait, wait! What do I say? It's C! I don't care, it's C!

953
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:09,080
C! It's C!

954
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:19,580
The answer was C. Graviton. Womp womp.

955
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,080
What do you mean?

956
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,080
Maybe the next character will know.

957
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,580
Try harder next time.

958
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,580
Oh well.

959
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,580
I'm bored now.

960
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,580
Shucks. Oh well. This is boring.

961
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:34,580
Oh she did.

962
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,580
Took my ladder away!

963
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,580
Someone help me!

964
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,580
I don't know how to work life!

965
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,080
Morkalify!

966
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,580
Give me a hand!

967
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,580
Morkalify, I'm drowning!

968
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,580
She's flashing me while I'm dying!

969
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,580
Mork, there's a better time for that!

970
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,580
Stop! Stop! I can't look!

971
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,580
Morkalify, put that away! Put—

972
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,080
Hey!

973
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,080
Hey!

974
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,580
Listen to me.

975
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,580
I'm drowning.

976
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,580
Listen to me.

977
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,580
I'm okay.

978
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,580
You made me watch dancing fruits on TV.

979
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,580
You liked it!

980
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,580
You made me dance next to horses.

981
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,080
I liked that.

982
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,580
Fuck you.

983
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,580
Wait! Wait, we can talk about it!

984
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,580
Morkalify, wait!

985
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,080
Die, idiot!

986
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,580
Morkalify!

987
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,580
Someone help me, I'm drowning.

988
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,580
Bae, Mork are killing me.
Bae, Mori are killing me.

989
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,080
They're literally drowning me.

990
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,580
Morkalify, she's killing me.

991
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,580
I'm alive! I'm not drowning!

992
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:07,580
But my wife, my child...

993
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,580
...my beautiful wife and child, where are they?

994
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,580
Why am I in the Grimm Kingdom? What about Nerissa?

995
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,580
My beautiful wife! No!

996
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,580
Nerissa, where did you go? I love you!

997
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,080
Why is everything on fire?

998
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,080
What?

999
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,580
There's a dragon here?

1000
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,580
My friends are made out of cardboard!

1001
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,580
They are not fire-resistant. Oh no.

1002
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,580
Okay, I see the Grams are doing their best to save them.

1003
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,580
Okay, Grams.

1004
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,580
What's this one doing? What are you up to?

1005
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,580
Oh, you are not helping at all.

1006
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,580
It's okay, little Gram. Your arms will reach one day.

1007
00:55:00,688 --> 00:55:01,888
These Grems on the other hand, you have magic!

1008
00:55:03,988 --> 00:55:04,688
Wow!

1009
00:55:05,188 --> 00:55:06,188
Where'd you learn this?

1010
00:55:07,588 --> 00:55:08,588
Grems are so talented.

1011
00:55:08,788 --> 00:55:09,688
Not you though.

1012
00:55:10,488 --> 00:55:11,888
That's okay, one day.

1013
00:55:14,388 --> 00:55:15,888
Oh Grems, Grems are working really hard so...

1014
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:21,088
I, me, Gigi Murin the hero, is here to save the day!

1015
00:55:23,288 --> 00:55:23,888
Oh!

1016
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:28,088
This must be my hero weapon, as all heroes have a hero weapon.

1017
00:55:28,988 --> 00:55:29,888
Okay.

1018
00:55:30,888 --> 00:55:31,288
Ooh!

1019
00:55:31,488 --> 00:55:32,088
Oh!

1020
00:55:31,188 --> 00:55:33,588
POPUPS!

1021
00:55:34,988 --> 00:55:36,588
1 million dollars?

1022
00:55:37,888 --> 00:55:43,088
Wh... oh, the kingdom can save itself. I am not—

1023
00:55:44,288 --> 00:55:46,088
Oh wait, a catapult! Of course!

1024
00:55:47,488 --> 00:55:50,088
Of course! Obviously! Okay, I'll help with this.

1025
00:55:50,488 --> 00:55:51,588
Don't worry, Grems.

1026
00:55:52,388 --> 00:55:54,088
Let me... what ammo is here?

1027
00:55:55,388 --> 00:55:56,588
Oh, okay. Let's...

1028
00:55:58,288 --> 00:55:59,888
Let's just pick this up.

1029
00:56:00,688 --> 00:56:02,888
Mnyaw mnyaw mnyaw...

1030
00:56:03,988 --> 00:56:04,388
Hah!

1031
00:56:04,988 --> 00:56:07,488
Yay! Let's go Grem! Let's save the kingdom!

1032
00:56:07,988 --> 00:56:10,688
Let's save the kingdom together! Yah!

1033
00:56:19,488 --> 00:56:21,388
Wait, we're barely scratching it!

1034
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:22,588
I don't know what to do.

1035
00:56:24,288 --> 00:56:25,888
Wait, there's just no other choice.

1036
00:56:26,388 --> 00:56:29,088
I'm gonna have to pull out that move.

1037
00:56:29,388 --> 00:56:30,588
Yeah, yeah that move!

1038
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:32,888
My ultimate move!

1039
00:56:33,488 --> 00:56:36,088
All right everyone, are you ready to see my ultimate move?

1040
00:56:37,488 --> 00:56:38,088
Okay.

1041
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:40,888
Ikuzo!
Let's go!

1042
00:56:44,588 --> 00:56:45,388
Stop!

1043
00:56:48,588 --> 00:56:50,088
Oji-chan, you scared me!
Old man, you scared me!

1044
00:56:50,388 --> 00:56:51,288
Oh, wait! No!

1045
00:56:52,088 --> 00:56:54,488
You took— you took the fire breath, Oji-chan!
You took— you took the fire breath, old man!

1046
00:56:54,688 --> 00:56:57,088
Stop it! Stop! You're gonna die!

1047
00:56:59,088 --> 00:57:01,088
Stop! No!

1048
00:57:01,488 --> 00:57:03,588
O-No, you're getting hurt! Please! I need you!

1049
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:08,088
If you're not here, who's gonna tell me how to defeat the dragon?

1050
00:57:08,988 --> 00:57:11,888
No! No! Please! Please!

1051
00:57:17,388 --> 00:57:19,488
You're getting hurt! Don't! No!

1052
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:35,388
Are you okay?

1053
00:57:35,688 --> 00:57:37,088
Oji-chan, are you okay?
Old man, are you okay?

1054
00:57:45,488 --> 00:57:46,388
You saved me!

1055
00:57:48,388 --> 00:57:50,088
I must... save...

1056
00:57:50,388 --> 00:57:51,388
Wh-What is it?

1057
00:57:51,988 --> 00:57:54,188
This kingdom...

1058
00:57:54,488 --> 00:57:55,288
The kingdom?

1059
00:57:56,588 --> 00:57:59,088
How am I supposed to save it without you?

1060
00:58:00,688 --> 00:58:01,388
I'm—

1061
00:58:01,688 --> 00:58:03,488
No! Oji-chan, no!
No! Old man, no!

1062
00:58:07,488 --> 00:58:11,588
I don't know how else to save the kingdom and destroy the dragon!

1063
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:13,388
It's not taking any damage!

1064
00:58:20,388 --> 00:58:22,088
Help! Call the guard!

1065
00:58:22,288 --> 00:58:24,488
Help! Call the guard!

1066
00:58:22,488 --> 00:58:23,088
Help! Call the guard!

1067
00:58:24,688 --> 00:58:26,088
Wizard graveyard!

1068
00:58:26,188 --> 00:58:28,088
Grems come and pray, Gremdal the Grey.

1069
00:58:30,488 --> 00:58:32,488
Danger is here, a dragon's appear.

1070
00:58:31,188 --> 00:58:32,088
What the...

1071
00:58:32,288 --> 00:58:33,288
What the hell?

1072
00:58:32,688 --> 00:58:35,088
Come seize the day, fight and we slay.

1073
00:58:35,188 --> 00:58:36,588
Gi-gi-mu-rin.

1074
00:58:36,688 --> 00:58:38,088
Here at the scene.

1075
00:58:38,188 --> 00:58:39,688
Look and behold, legends foretold.

1076
00:58:39,788 --> 00:58:41,788
She is the brave, souls will be saved.

1077
00:58:41,888 --> 00:58:43,788
Please do not stare, crazy footwear.

1078
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:45,488
She packs a punch, munch them for lunch.

1079
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:47,388
From near and far, hit by a car.

1080
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:46,888
Where did you come from?

1081
00:58:47,488 --> 00:58:51,688
Gremurin come outside to pray, oh.

1082
00:58:49,188 --> 00:58:50,888
So many of you!

1083
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:54,088
Like... like fifteen of you!

1084
00:58:53,688 --> 00:58:57,088
Gremurin, Gremurin.

1085
00:58:55,688 --> 00:58:57,388
Wait, what are you singing about?

1086
00:58:58,888 --> 00:58:59,888
About me?

1087
00:58:59,988 --> 00:59:02,188
Help! Call the guard!

1088
00:59:00,888 --> 00:59:02,088
Gigi Murin...

1089
00:59:02,488 --> 00:59:03,588
That... wait.

1090
00:59:02,388 --> 00:59:03,488
Grems come and pray...

1091
00:59:03,688 --> 00:59:06,088
Danger is here, a dragon's appear.

1092
00:59:04,288 --> 00:59:06,388
That's right! I am a hero!

1093
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:07,888
Come seize the day, fight and we slay.

1094
00:59:08,088 --> 00:59:09,188
Gi-gi-mu-rin.

1095
00:59:08,588 --> 00:59:10,088
I can save the day!

1096
00:59:09,288 --> 00:59:10,588
Here at the scene.

1097
00:59:10,688 --> 00:59:12,388
Look and behold, legends foretold.

1098
00:59:11,488 --> 00:59:14,388
Through the power of these children singing for me!

1099
00:59:12,488 --> 00:59:14,388
She is the brave, souls will be saved.

1100
00:59:14,488 --> 00:59:16,188
Please do not stare, crazy footwear.

1101
00:59:15,588 --> 00:59:16,888
I could do anything!

1102
00:59:16,288 --> 00:59:18,188
She packs a punch, munch them for lunch.

1103
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:18,188
Yeah!

1104
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:20,188
From near and far, hit by a car.

1105
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,188
Yeah, I could do it all!

1106
00:59:21,288 --> 00:59:23,388
Okay, okay what should I do? What should I do, Grems?

1107
00:59:22,388 --> 00:59:24,488
Joy she will bring, Grems they will sing.

1108
00:59:23,588 --> 00:59:25,088
What should I do? I don't know!

1109
00:59:24,688 --> 00:59:26,588
Nothing to fear, Gigi is here.

1110
00:59:25,888 --> 00:59:28,088
I know! Through the power of interpretive dance!

1111
00:59:28,288 --> 00:59:31,088
That's the only way we can destroy a dragon.

1112
00:59:31,288 --> 00:59:34,088
Because it has not been taking any physical damage.

1113
00:59:31,588 --> 00:59:35,388
Gremurin, come outside to pray, oh.

1114
00:59:34,288 --> 00:59:38,688
So, the best way to defeat this dragon is through mental damage!

1115
00:59:37,488 --> 00:59:41,088
Gremurin, Gremurin.

1116
00:59:38,888 --> 00:59:39,688
All right!

1117
00:59:40,888 --> 00:59:42,588
I've never done a worm before. I'm about to do a worm.

1118
00:59:46,488 --> 00:59:47,488
Help! Call the guard!

1119
00:59:47,688 --> 00:59:49,088
Grems come and pray...

1120
00:59:48,888 --> 00:59:49,888
Is it working?

1121
00:59:49,188 --> 00:59:50,588
Danger is here, a dragon's appear.

1122
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:53,388
She is the brave, souls will be saved.

1123
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:54,088
Die, dragon! I'm sorry!

1124
00:59:53,488 --> 00:59:55,388
Please do not stare, crazy footwear.

1125
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,396
She packs a punch, munch them for lunch

1126
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:02,596
I-I'm not an interpretive dancer!

1127
01:00:02,596 --> 01:00:04,096
From near and far, hit by a car

1128
01:00:04,096 --> 01:00:06,596
Joy she will bring, Grems they will sing

1129
01:00:06,596 --> 01:00:09,096
Nothing to fear, Gigi is here

1130
01:00:09,096 --> 01:00:11,096
Gigi is here!

1131
01:00:11,096 --> 01:00:12,096
Don't worry!

1132
01:00:12,096 --> 01:00:13,396
Another cartwheel!

1133
01:00:13,396 --> 01:00:14,596
A second one even!

1134
01:00:13,896 --> 01:00:15,096
Help! Call the guard

1135
01:00:15,096 --> 01:00:16,596
Grems come and pray

1136
01:00:15,896 --> 01:00:16,896
Yeah!

1137
01:00:16,896 --> 01:00:17,596
And then- and then a worm!

1138
01:00:17,596 --> 01:00:20,096
She is The Brave, souls will be saved

1139
01:00:20,096 --> 01:00:21,096
Is it working?

1140
01:00:21,096 --> 01:00:22,596
Is the dragon being cringed out by me?

1141
01:00:21,096 --> 01:00:23,096
Please do not stare, crazy footwear

1142
01:00:23,096 --> 01:00:25,096
Oh no! I cannot do this!

1143
01:00:23,096 --> 01:00:25,596
She packs a punch, munch them for lunch

1144
01:00:25,596 --> 01:00:27,596
From near and far, hit by a car

1145
01:00:27,596 --> 01:00:30,596
Joy she will bring, Grems they will sing

1146
01:00:30,596 --> 01:00:32,596

Tell me, children!

1154
01:00:45,096 --> 01:00:46,596

1157
01:00:47,896 --> 01:00:49,096
What is this?

1158
01:00:49,096 --> 01:00:50,596
It's power I'm feeling.

1159
01:00:52,596 --> 01:00:54,596
Oh no! It's surging in my veins!

1160

Oh, Ojii-chan! It was all thanks to you and the fifteen children!

1175

Yay!

1177

You're still dead? NOOOOO!
