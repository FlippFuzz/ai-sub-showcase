悲しみ乗り越えた微笑みに
In the smile that overcame sadness

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,100
君を信じていいですか
Can I believe in you?

8
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,850
終わりがなくて 見つけられなくって
Endless and unable to find

9
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,950
迷ったりしたけれど
I wandered, but...

10
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,150
傷ついたこと 失ったもの
The things that hurt, the things I lost

11
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,450
いつかは輝きに変えて
I'll turn them into radiance someday

12
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,450
後悔に決して負けない翼が
Wings that will never yield to regret

13
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,250
きっとあるから
I'm sure they are there

14
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,350
君とならどこでも
With you, anywhere...

15
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,250
行ける気がする
I feel like I can go

16
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,350
夢の国を探す君の名を
Searching for your name, seeking the land of dreams

17
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,550
誰もが心に刻むまで
Until everyone carves it into their hearts

18
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,750
悲しみ乗り越えた微笑みに
In the smile that overcame sadness

19
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,950
君を信じていいですか
Can I believe in you?

20
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
君を信じていいですか
Can I believe in you?

21
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,000
みなさーん、こんぬいー！
Hello everyone, Konnui!

22
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
不知火フレアです！
I'm Shiranui Flare!

23
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,500
今日は私の4周年記念LIVE「平成初期アニソン祭り」へようこそ！
Welcome to my 4th anniversary live, "Early Heisei Anime Song Festival", today!

24
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,500
1曲目は「仙界伝 封神演義」のオープニングテーマ「WILL」でした！
The first song was "WILL", the opening theme of "Senkaiden Houshin Engi"!

25
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:26,500
今日はね、みんなが知ってる懐かしい曲をたくさん用意してきたから、
Today, I've prepared many nostalgic songs that everyone knows,

26
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:11,489
一人ぼっちじゃ 生きて行けないって
You told me that I can't live all alone

27
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:15,209
あの時教えてくれた
You taught me that back then

28
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:19,449
近くにあっても 気付かずにいた
Even when they were close by, I didn't notice

29
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:23,169
本当に大切なこと
The things that are truly important

30
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,490
この宇宙の果てに 何が待っていても
No matter what awaits at the edge of this universe

31
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,210
きっと大丈夫
I'm sure it'll be okay

32
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:37,730
その瞳に映る未来 感じてるから
Because I feel the future reflected in those eyes

33
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:43,011
夢の国を探す 君の名を
Your name, as you search for a dreamland

34
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:46,731
誰もが心に刻むまで
Until everyone carves it into their hearts

35
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:51,331
偶然じゃない 運命の中で
In a fate that is no coincidence

36
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:54,851
君の奇跡を信じてる
I believe in your miracle

37
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:58,771
夢の楽園を 探しながら
While searching for a dream paradise

38
00:05:58,771 --> 00:06:02,692
走る君を見つめていたい
I want to keep watching you run

39
00:06:03,252 --> 00:06:06,972
誇り高く 汚れを知らない
So proud and pure

40
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:11,052
君を信じていいですか
Can I believe in you?

41
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:47,054
夢の国を探す 君の名を
Your name, as you search for a dreamland

42
00:06:47,054 --> 00:06:50,894
誰もが心に刻むまで
Until everyone carves it into their hearts

43
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:54,655
悲しみ乗り越えた 微笑みに
In that smile that overcame sadness

44
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:58,495
君を信じていいですか
Can I believe in you?

45
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:02,735
夢の楽園を 探しながら
While searching for a dream paradise

46
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:06,655
走る君を見つめていたい
I want to keep watching you run

47
00:07:07,216 --> 00:07:10,936
誇り高く 汚れを知らない
So proud and pure

48
00:07:10,936 --> 00:07:15,016
君を信じていいですか
Can I believe in you?

49
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,559
はい、ということで！
All right, then!

50
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,120
こんぬいー！ホロライブ3期生の不知火フレアです！
Kon-nui! I'm Shiranui Flare from Hololive 3rd Gen!

51
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:07,000
今日は遅れてきた私の4周年記念ライブに来てくれて、どうもありがとうございます！
Thank you so much for coming to my late 4th anniversary live today!

52
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,160
最初の一曲目を聞いていただきましたが...
You just heard the first song...

53
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,921
今回のテーマはなんと！平成初期アニソン祭り！
The theme this time is... Early Heisei Era Anisong Festival!

54
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:23,881
思わず「こういうのがいいんだよ」って言いたくなっちゃうかも？
You might find yourself saying, "This is exactly what I needed."

55
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:29,321
みんなの好きだったあんな曲やこんな曲を歌えたら嬉しいなって思ってます。
I hope I can sing all those songs you guys loved.

56

61
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:56,083
おっ？早速だけど、どこかでゲストの声がする...
Oh? Right away, I can hear a guest's voice somewhere...

62
00:08:56,763 --> 00:08:59,163
どこだろう？
I wonder where?

63
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:06,308
輝きは君の中に
Brightness is inside of you

64
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:23,125
楽しいことでも 毎日続いたら
Even fun things, if they continue every day

65
00:09:23,845 --> 00:09:29,925
それと気付かずに 退屈と
I might not notice it and call it boredom

66
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:32,886
変わらないで
Without changing

67
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:38,966
幸せ悲しみ 代わる代わるの波
Waves of happiness and sadness, one after another

68
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:46,807
心の不思議が 分かりかけてくる
I'm starting to understand the mystery of the heart

69
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:54,847
人を愛したら 不安も知るものだけど
When you love someone, you also get to know anxiety, but

70
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:59,887
寂しい心に 深く
Deep in a lonely heart

71
00:10:00,636 --> 00:13:48,636
輝きは君の中に
The Sparkle Is Within You

72
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:01,986
小さく
A small sting...

73
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:04,936
しみるよ
...deep inside.

74
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:09,136
ジグザグ迷い続けてる
Continuing to wander in a zigzag...

75
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:13,836
近道なんてないのかな
Is there no shortcut, I wonder?

76
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:17,436
だけど 楽しいだけならば
But if it's only about having fun,

77
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:21,136
きっと 幸せ 見失う
I'm sure I'll lose sight of happiness.

78
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:25,036
まっすぐ自分も言葉
Directly, both myself and my words,

79
00:10:25,036 --> 00:10:28,736
君に届かないときは
When they don't reach you,

80
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:33,036
ふいに無口になるけれど
I suddenly become silent, but...

81
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:37,936
いつかどこかで 感じあえる
Someday, somewhere, we can feel each other's presence.

82
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:47,936
悲しみを避けて
Avoiding sadness

83
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:51,936
笑うのは簡単
Is easy to do

84
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:55,836
諦め上手な大人に
I don't want to become

85
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:59,336
なりたくない
An adult who's good at giving up

86
00:10:59,336 --> 00:11:02,936
自分ひとりだけ
When I feel like I'm the only one

87
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:06,736
空回りしてると
Spinning my wheels

88
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:10,136
誰もが器用に
It feels like everyone else

89
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:14,436
生きてる気がする
Is living so skillfully

90
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:19,136
人は傷つけて
People hurt others

91
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,436
自分を守るよ
To protect themselves

92
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:25,936
朝は虚しさを残して
The morning leaves a sense of emptiness,

93
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:30,636
やがて 自分も傷つく
And eventually, I end up hurting too.

94
00:11:33,436 --> 00:11:36,736
ジグザグ迷い続けても
Even if we keep wandering in a zigzag,

95
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:41,436
振り返れば煌めいてる
When we look back, it's sparkling.

96
00:11:41,436 --> 00:11:44,836
つらい別れのあと独り
Even that time after a painful parting when I sat alone,

97
00:11:44,836 --> 00:11:48,936
膝を抱えてたことも
Holding my knees.

98
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:52,936
まっすぐ自分の気持ち
On the day my direct feelings

99
00:11:52,936 --> 00:11:56,836
君に届いたその日は
Reach you,

100
00:11:56,836 --> 00:12:00,636
きっと涙があふれるね
I'm sure tears will overflow.

101
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:04,636
愛を信じた答えだから
Because that's the answer to believing in love.

102
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:55,636
I can't stop my love for you

103
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:55,636
作詞：愛内里菜 作曲：川島だりあ
Lyrics: Aiuchi Rina, Composition: Kawashima Daria

104
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:07,336
I can't stop my love for you

105
00:14:07,336 --> 00:14:11,136
二人の重なる未来に
In our overlapping future,

106
00:14:11,136 --> 00:14:17,936
君との居場所があるように
I hope there's a place for me with you.

107
00:14:17,936 --> 00:14:21,136
Oh baby, I can't stop my love for you

108
00:14:21,136 --> 00:14:24,636
君のすべてになってね
Please become my everything.

109
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:28,836
繋いだ手信じて
Believing in our joined hands,

110
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:32,936
歩いて行くと誓うよ
I swear to keep walking.

111
00:14:34,336 --> 00:14:37,836
二人の目の前 謎めく広がり
Before the two of us, a mysterious expanse...

112
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:45,336
未完成な地図
An incomplete map,

113
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:49,136
でもとても とても心動いた
But it moved my heart so, so much.

114
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:53,436
どんな言葉並べてみても
No matter what words I line up,

115
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:57,136
語りきれない想い
These feelings can't be fully told.

116
00:14:57,136 --> 00:14:59,636
この愛が ささやくよ
This love whispers,

117
00:14:59,636 --> 00:15:01,936
愛しいと
"You are dear to me."

118
00:15:00,963 --> 00:18:03,963
I can't stop my love for you ❤️

119
00:15:00,963 --> 00:16:02,273
...の意味を
...the meaning of...

120
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:06,113
I can't stop my love for you

121
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,783
二人歩むスピードは
The speed at which we two walk...

122
00:15:10,093 --> 00:15:16,183
きっと同じはずじゃないからね
...surely won't be the same.

123
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:22,803
もしも君の隣に　この手が離れた時は
If, when I'm by your side, this hand should let go...

124
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:30,583
見失わないように　きっと　迎えに来てね
...so you don't lose sight of me, please come for me.

125
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:53,013
大嫌いなんて　嘘でも言わないけど
I wouldn't say I hate you, even as a lie.

126
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:59,703
大好きだって　嘘なんかじゃ意味ないからね
Because saying I love you means nothing if it's a lie.

127
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:07,993
会えない時さえ君は　何も考える余裕もないくらい
Even when we can't meet, I don't have time to think of anything else...

128
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:14,113
この心　独り占めにするんだから
...because you've taken over my heart.

129
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,303
I can't stop my love for you

130
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:22,613
二つの愛が離れて
So our two loves don't...

131
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:28,723
しまわないように一つに抱いてて
...drift apart, hold them as one.

132
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:35,573
それでも不安な夜は　訪れるものだからね
Even so, nights of anxiety will still come.

133
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:44,563
そんな時はぎゅっと　大袈裟に抱きしめていて
At those times, hold me tight, even if it's an exaggeration.

134
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:53,493
かけがえのない今を　君が沢山ここにくれた
You've given me so much of this irreplaceable "now".

135
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:07,363
だけど何よりも一番　かけがえのないものは
But the thing that's more irreplaceable than anything else...

136
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:12,813
君なんだ
...is you.

137
00:17:14,343 --> 00:17:16,783
I can't stop my love for you

138
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:21,003
二人が辿る未来に
In the future we two follow...

139
00:17:21,003 --> 00:17:27,113
君との居場所があるように
...I hope there's a place for me by your side.

140
00:17:27,503 --> 00:17:30,093
Oh baby I can't stop my love for you

141
00:17:30,093 --> 00:17:34,413
君のすべてになってね
Be my everything.

142

Believing in our joined hands, I vow to walk on.

144
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:19,383
潔く カッコよく 生きてゆこう
Let's live purely and coolly.

145
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:26,093
たとえ二人離ればなれになっても
Even if we two are pulled apart...

146
00:18:26,343 --> 00:18:30,313
Take my revolution

147
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:38,413
光さす庭で手を取り合い
Joining hands in the sunlit garden...

148
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:42,013
誓い合ったなぐさめ合った
...we made vows and comforted each other.

149
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:49,293
もう恋は二度としないよって
Saying we'd never fall in love again.

150
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:53,993
そんな強い結束は形を変え
That strong bond has changed its form...

151
00:18:53,993 --> 00:18:57,513
今じゃこんなに逞しい私達の
...to our current, resilient...

152
00:18:57,513 --> 00:19:04,003
ライフスタイル エブリディ エブリタイム
...lifestyle, every day, every time.

153
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:09,513
頬寄せ合って写る写真の笑顔に
In the smiles of the photos taken with cheeks together...

154
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:17,813
少しの寂しさ詰め込んで
...I packed a little bit of loneliness.

155
00:19:22,283 --> 00:19:25,593
潔く カッコよく 明日からは
Purely and coolly, from tomorrow...

156
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:29,113
誰もが振り向く女になる
...I'll become a woman everyone turns to look at.

157
00:19:29,393 --> 00:19:33,283
たとえ二人離ればなれになっても
Even if we two are pulled apart...

158
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:36,913
心はずっと一緒に
...our hearts will always be together.

159
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,490
...いられないね
...can't stay as you are.

160
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,390
若い子みんなそうだと 思われるのは
I don't like it when people think
all young kids are like that.

161
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,790
不本意で どうしようもないじゃない
It's so frustrating and there's nothing I can do.

162
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,490
でもね
But you know...

163
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,290
私たち友達のこと 何より大切にしてる
We treasure our friends more than anything else.

164
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:23,790
きっと大人よりも
Even more than adults, I'm sure.

165
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,690
夢を見て 涙して 傷ついても
Even if we dream, cry, and get hurt...

166
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,790
現実は がむしゃらに来るし
Reality comes at us relentlessly.

167
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:42,490
自分の居場所 存在価値は 失くせない
We can't lose our place or the value of our existence.

In order to protect ourselves.

169
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,390
あのアドバルーン 戻れない
That ad-balloon won't return...

170
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,790
それぞれの 道を選ぶ時が来る前に
...before the time comes for us to choose our own paths.

171
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,690
こんなにも こんなにも 大切な
These precious memories...

172
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,290
思い出 解き放つよ
...so many of them, I will set them free.

173
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:42,090
Take my revolution 生きて行こう
Take my revolution, let's live on.

174
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,890
現実は がむしゃらに来るし

自分の居場所 存在価値を 見つけたい
I want to find my place and the value of my existence.

176
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,790
今日までの自分を
Everything about myself up until today...

177
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,490
潔く 脱ぎ捨てる 裸になる
...I'll resolutely cast off and lay myself bare.

178
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,490
自由を舞う 薔薇のように
Like a rose dancing in freedom.

179
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,490
たとえ二人 離ればなれになっても
Even if the two of us are torn apart...

180
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,790
私は世界を変える
I will change the world.

A miraculous wind blows through my chest.

183
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,290
ちょっぴり強くなれる気がして
I feel like I can become a little stronger.

184
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,790
純情なMy感情が
My innocent emotions...

185
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:25,090
騒ぎ出す
...begin to stir.

186
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,390
知らず知らずに 鍵をかけていた
Without even realizing it, I had locked them away.

187
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,290

Oh, Love Hearts, now is the time.

188

Those miscellaneous swords...

00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,090
振り解き放て
...shake them off and set them free.

190
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,790

僕の心で
In my heart

277
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:05,437

293
00:33:15,737 --> 00:33:23,437
瞳を閉じれば微笑む顔が見える
If I close my eyes, I can see your smiling face

294
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:31,537
大好きなあの歌今も歌ってますか
Are you still singing that song I love?

295
00:33:31,737 --> 00:33:35,137
私には聴こえる
I can hear it

優しい声とメロディ
the gentle voice and melody

297
00:33:39,337 --> 00:33:43,337
弱気なときほど
Especially when I'm feeling low

298
00:33:43,337 --> 00:33:48,437
あなたを思い出す
I remember you

299
00:33:53,537 --> 00:33:59,537
時々自分が嫌いになるのは
The times I occasionally end up hating myself...

300
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:08,037
軽はずみな言葉で誰かを傷つけ
...are when I hurt someone with thoughtless words

301
00:34:08,037 --> 00:34:16,237
その癖弱くてちっぽけだから
And yet, because I'm weak and small

302
00:34:16,237 --> 00:34:24,137
逃げようとする私を叱ってください
Please scold me for trying to run away

303
00:34:24,837 --> 00:34:32,937
二人で歌ったメロディ口ずさんでみれば
If I try humming the melody we sang together

304
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:42,437
涙が一筋流れて会いたくなった
A single tear falls and I miss you

I heard it through the receiver

Memories that are too vivid

Even in a lost and troubled future

312
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:14,763

With a boy's heart

314

315
00:35:40,163 --> 00:35:44,063
二人で出会ったあの日に
To that day when the two of us met

316
00:35:44,263 --> 00:35:48,263
戻れないけど
I can't go back, but...

317
00:35:50,563 --> 00:35:54,063
瞳を閉じれば
If I close my eyes

318
00:35:54,263 --> 00:35:58,063
微笑む顔が見える
I can see your smiling face

319
00:35:58,263 --> 00:36:02,263
大好きなあの歌
That song I love so much

320
00:36:02,463 --> 00:36:05,763
今も歌ってますか？
Are you still singing it now?

321
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:10,263
私には聞こえる
I can hear it

322
00:36:10,463 --> 00:36:14,063
優しい声とメロディ
That gentle voice and melody

323
00:36:14,263 --> 00:36:17,763

Especially when I feel weak

324

Heard over the phone receiver

326

聞いて聞かせてくれた
You listened and let me hear

327
00:36:32,063 --> 00:36:35,763
リフレインするフレーズ
The refraining phrase

328

ここまで、みんなは何曲知ってましたか？
How many of the songs so far did you know?

336
00:37:39,263 --> 00:37:42,263
初めて聴いた曲もあったかな？
Maybe there were some you heard for the first time?

337
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:47,563
今回、尺の都合で歌えない曲もたくさんあって、
There were so many songs I couldn't sing this time due to time constraints,

338
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:52,763
平成初期のアニソンは名曲もいっぱいで、何を歌おうかすごく悩みました！
And since there are so many masterpieces among early Heisei era anime songs, I really struggled to decide what to sing!

339
00:37:53,263 --> 00:37:55,763
まだまだ、盛り上がっていきましょう！
Let's keep the excitement going!

340
00:37:56,263 --> 00:38:00,763
今回選んだ曲とか、コラボ相手については、
As for the songs I chose this time and my collab partners,

341
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:04,563
また振り返りとかで、ゆっくりお話しさせてください。
I'll talk more about that slowly during a review stream later.

ハッシュタグも活用してくれるかな？
I hope you'll make use of the hashtag too!

343
00:38:09,263 --> 00:38:14,563
えー、そして、すでに気づいている人も、もしかしたらいるかもしれないですが、
Uh, and, there might be some people who've noticed already,

344
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:20,763
実は、ここまでの曲、なんとすべてオープニング曲だったんですよ！
But actually, all the songs so far have been opening themes!

345
00:38:21,263 --> 00:38:24,763
ってことは、次からは…
Which means, starting from the next one...

346
00:38:24,863 --> 00:38:28,763
エンディング曲パートにいっちゃうぞー！
We're moving on to the ending theme part!

347
00:38:29,763 --> 00:38:32,263
キマった。えっ、何何何？雪？
Nailed it. Eh, what, what, what? Snow?

348
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:53,263
靴の底がすり減ってる
The soles of my shoes are worn out

349
00:38:53,363 --> 00:38:56,763

難しいと感じたよ
I've felt that it's difficult

352

My self who can do nothing but nod

353
00:39:08,863 --> 00:39:12,263
嫌いになってる
I'm starting to hate it

354
00:39:12,763 --> 00:39:16,563
世の中には思い通りいかないことも
In this world, there are things that don't go as planned,

355
00:39:16,663 --> 00:39:20,263
あるけれど
although there are...

356
00:39:20,463 --> 00:39:24,063
落ち込むだけ落ち込んだら

00:39:39,863 --> 00:39:43,263
の犠牲はもうやだよ
I'm done with sacrifices

00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:47,263
気持ちに嘘つくようなことはやめて
Stop doing things like lying to your feelings

00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:20,889
音でわかる
I can tell.

373
00:40:20,889 --> 00:40:22,589
もうだめだね
It's over for us,

374
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:24,389

455
00:48:26,415 --> 00:48:31,415
短いようで長い道を
On this road that seems short yet long,

456
00:48:31,415 --> 00:48:36,615
旅してふたりここに立ってる
we've traveled and now stand here together

457
00:48:36,615 --> 00:48:41,115
高らかに鳴り響く鐘の音は
The sound of the bell ringing loudly

458
00:48:41,115 --> 00:48:44,915
晴れやかな今日がゴールじゃなくて
means today's clear sky isn't the goal

459
00:48:44,915 --> 00:48:49,215
お互いの胸の奥 響きあう
It resonates deep within our hearts

460
00:48:49,215 --> 00:48:53,915
これからも続く長い旅をつげる
Heralding the long journey that continues

461
00:48:53,915 --> 00:48:57,915
勇気の鐘
The bell of courage

462
00:49:05,415 --> 00:49:09,415
夢をみる ふたりいっしょに
We dream together

463
00:49:09,415 --> 00:49:13,915
ひとりでは たどりつけない
Somewhere we couldn't reach alone

464
00:49:13,915 --> 00:49:16,415
邪魔なのは
What gets in the way

465
00:49:16,415 --> 00:49:21,915
後悔とうすいプライド
is regret and shallow pride

466
00:49:21,915 --> 00:49:24,715
彼の目に
In his eyes,

467
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:26,915
汗がにじんで
sweat wells up

468
00:49:26,915 --> 00:49:29,415
うつむいて弱音吐くなら
and if he hangs his head in weakness

469
00:49:29,415 --> 00:49:33,915
その頬を 泣いてでも
Even if you're crying,

470
00:49:33,915 --> 00:49:38,415
たたいてあげて
give those cheeks a slap

471
00:49:38,415 --> 00:49:42,115
瞬間だけの なぐさめなんて
Comfort that's only for a moment

472
00:49:42,115 --> 00:49:46,415
中途半端な優しさに似てる
is like half-hearted kindness

473
00:49:46,415 --> 00:49:51,415
はるか彼方に昇る太陽
The sun rising in the far distance—

474
00:49:51,415 --> 00:49:56,515
顔をあげてなきゃ瞳がくもる
your eyes will cloud if you don't look up

475
00:49:56,515 --> 00:50:00,415
いつまでも 鐘の音が
So the sound of the bell

476
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:02,915
響くように 深呼吸で...
echoes forever, with a deep breath...

477
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:08,240
勇気の鐘～晴れてハレルヤII～
The Bell of Courage ~Harete Hallelujah II~

478
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,090
深呼吸で心に風送ろう
Send a breeze to my heart with a deep breath.

479
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:08,665
だけどもしふたりめげたりしたら
But if the two of us ever get discouraged,

480
00:50:08,665 --> 00:50:12,515
一番乗りで待っていてあげたい
I want to be the first one there waiting for you.

481
00:50:12,515 --> 00:50:17,090
勇気の丘
The Hill of Courage.

482
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:21,490
なだらかなレンガの階段を
Up the gentle brick staircase,

483
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:25,665
腕を組みふたり登りはじめる
Hand in hand, the two of us begin to climb.

484
00:50:25,665 --> 00:50:29,715
お互いに夢をかかえあえたら
If we can share our dreams with each other,

485
00:50:29,715 --> 00:50:33,690
夢に近づくたびクレッシェンドする
They crescendo every time we get closer.

486
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:37,740
勇気の鐘
The Bell of Courage.

487
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:44,740
Alone

488
00:51:54,765 --> 00:51:59,315
乾いた風が吹く
A dry wind blows.

489
00:51:59,815 --> 00:52:04,765
街は凍えている
The town is freezing.

490
00:52:04,765 --> 00:52:11,815
いくつもの季節がそっと音もなく
Many seasons have passed quietly,

491
00:52:11,815 --> 00:52:16,790
過ぎ去ったのだろう
without a sound.

492
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:21,815
行き交う人はみな
Everyone passing by

493
00:52:21,815 --> 00:52:27,265
重い荷物背負って
is carrying a heavy burden.

494
00:52:27,265 --> 00:52:33,290
遠くに揺れる陽炎の中に
In the heat haze shimmering in the distance,

495
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:38,765
明日を見つける
they search for tomorrow.

496
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:44,265
この手からこぼれ落ちる
Slipping through my fingers,

497
00:52:44,265 --> 00:52:50,290
砂のような感情
feelings like sand.

498
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:55,815
あの時胸に刺さった
The words that pierced my heart back then

499
00:52:55,815 --> 00:53:02,765
言葉が不意にうずくけど
suddenly ache again, but...

500
00:53:03,315 --> 00:53:08,815
果てしない夜を数えながら
While counting the endless nights,

501
00:53:08,815 --> 00:53:14,815
自分のカケラ探していた
I was searching for pieces of myself.

502
00:53:15,315 --> 00:53:20,315
失うほどにこの思いは
The more I lose, the stronger

503
00:53:20,315 --> 00:53:26,315
確かになっていく
this feeling becomes.

504
00:53:26,315 --> 00:53:31,815
今ならきっと歩いていける
Now I'm sure I can keep walking,

505
00:53:31,815 --> 00:53:36,765
どこまでも
no matter how far.

506
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:55,265
どうしてこの空は
Why is this sky

507
00:53:55,265 --> 00:54:00,315
こんなに広いのだろう
so incredibly vast?

508
00:54:00,315 --> 00:54:06,790
叫んでみても声にならなくて
Even if I scream, no sound comes out,

509
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:12,265
涙があふれた
and my tears overflow.

510
00:54:12,265 --> 00:54:17,315
自由に風切って
Cutting through the wind with freedom,

511
00:54:17,315 --> 00:54:22,815
鳥たちはどこへ行くの
where are the birds heading?

512
00:54:22,815 --> 00:54:29,315
少しだけ時間の海に
For just a moment, in the sea of time,

513
00:54:29,315 --> 00:54:35,315
同じ場所に戻れない
I can't go back to the same place.

514
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:41,765
このまま夢を諦めても
Even if I were to give up on my dream like this,

515
00:54:41,765 --> 00:54:47,815
高鳴る鼓動抑えきれない
I can't suppress my racing heartbeat.

516
00:54:47,815 --> 00:54:53,790
いつかはきっと近づきたい
I want to get closer someday

517
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:59,265
あの雲の高さ
to the height of those clouds.

518
00:54:59,265 --> 00:55:03,240
もう一度ここから
Once more, from here.

519
00:55:03,565 --> 00:55:05,685
空に翼広げ
Spreading wings in the sky,

520
00:55:05,685 --> 00:55:08,545
旅立つよ
I'm setting off on a journey.

521
00:55:25,615 --> 00:55:31,295
どんな路も辿り着けるはず
I should be able to reach any path.

522
00:55:33,185 --> 00:55:38,595
果てない夜を数えながら
While counting the endless nights,

523
00:55:38,595 --> 00:55:44,415
自分の欠片探していた
I was searching for pieces of myself.

524
00:55:44,415 --> 00:55:50,105
失うほどにこの想いが
The more I lose, the more these feelings

525
00:55:50,105 --> 00:55:55,575
確かになってゆく
become certain.

526
00:55:55,575 --> 00:56:01,505
今ならきっと歩いてゆける
Now I'm sure I can keep walking,

527
00:56:01,505 --> 00:56:06,325
どこまでも
no matter how far.

528
00:56:17,915 --> 00:56:22,945
