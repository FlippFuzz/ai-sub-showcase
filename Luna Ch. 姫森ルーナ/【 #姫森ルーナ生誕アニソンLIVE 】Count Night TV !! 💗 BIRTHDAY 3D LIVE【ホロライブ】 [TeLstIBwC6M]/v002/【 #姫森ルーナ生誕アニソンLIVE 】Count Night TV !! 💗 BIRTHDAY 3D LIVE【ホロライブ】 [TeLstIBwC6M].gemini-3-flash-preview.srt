もう決めたんだ
...I've already decided on it.

140
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:47,529
明日の夢がふくらんでくる
My dreams for tomorrow are growing.

141
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:51,229
この愛を to you
This love, to you.

142

いつまでも to you
Forever, to you.

143
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:01,029
きっと きっと きっとさ
Surely, surely, I'm sure of it.

144
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:04,537
ohh

145
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:07,137

I will give you all my love.

148
00:15:15,137 --> 00:15:19,437
なぜか優しい気持ちが
For some reason, a gentle feeling...

149
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:22,337
Ah いっぱい
Ah, is filling me up

150
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:25,037

I will give you all my love.

153
00:15:33,037 --> 00:15:37,337
涙が出ちゃう男のくせに
Tears are coming out, even though I'm a boy

154
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,637
Be in love with you.

155
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:58,537

My first kiss

156
00:15:58,687 --> 00:16:01,037
君とチュウ
A kiss with you

157
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:05,037
I will give you all my love.

158
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:10,437
なぜか優しい気持ちが
For some reason, a gentle feeling...

159
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:13,337

Be in love with you.

165
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:49,037
Lovin' you

166
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,337
Lovin' you

167
00:16:58,237 --> 00:16:59,937
Lovin' you

168
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:02,137
Can't stop

169
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:05,037
Lovin' you

170
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:18,837
ということで 3曲連続で歌っていただきました
And with that, she sang three songs in a row!

171
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:20,237
イエーイ！
Yay!

172
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:23,037
姫の歌声が沁みるのらね
The Princess's singing voice really hits home, doesn't it?

173
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:27,537
にしても 今日のステージはセットも気合入ってますな
Even so, today's stage set has a lot of effort put into it!

だんご大家族
Dango Daikazoku

184
00:17:58,737 --> 00:18:03,537
届け 届け 想いよ 届け
Reach out, reach out, let my feelings reach out

185
00:18:03,837 --> 00:18:07,137
そうあの日笑顔 私の願い全て
Yes, that day's smile was all of my wishes

186
00:18:07,237 --> 00:18:10,337
君と優しい時間へと
Towards a gentle time with you

187
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,537
届け
Reach out

188
00:18:23,737 --> 00:18:25,837
海の青広がる
The blue of the sea spreads out

189
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:30,037
赤煉瓦その向こうに
Beyond those red bricks

190
00:18:30,337 --> 00:18:31,537
ねえ
Hey

191
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,337
光る磯波越え
Crossing the sparkling waves at the shore

192
00:18:36,437 --> 00:18:40,037
叢雲の空眩しい
The sky with gathering clouds is dazzling

193
00:18:40,437 --> 00:18:42,537
あー
Ah

194
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:49,237
言葉選んで瞳伏せても
Even if I choose my words and cast my eyes down

195
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:55,537
見えない明日も君の笑顔も！
Neither the invisible tomorrow nor your smile!

196
00:18:57,337 --> 00:19:01,837
白く白く吹雪のような
White and white, like a blizzard

197
00:19:02,237 --> 00:19:05,437
そう出逢う前から解ってたこの想い
Yes, I've known these feelings since before we even met

198
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:08,437
今ならもっとずっと強く
Now, even more, much stronger

199
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:13,037
強く強く願いは強く
Strongly, strongly, my wish is strong

200
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:16,337
繋ぐよその手を感じて明日を
I'll hold on, feeling your hand, towards tomorrow

201
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:20,137
信じる優しい未来へと
Into the gentle future I believe in

202
00:19:20,237 --> 00:19:24,037
届け
Reach out

203
00:19:35,637 --> 00:19:38,337
水平線陽が落ちて
As the sun sets over the horizon

204
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:42,437
夕焼け君を染める
The sunset colors you

205
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:43,837
ねえ
Hey

206
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:49,237
ずっとこのままなんて
Thinking it would stay like this forever

207
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:53,137
いいじゃない想うだけなら
Is fine, if it's just a thought

208
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:55,537
けど
But

209
00:19:56,637 --> 00:20:01,537
きっと違うのいかなきゃだめなの？
Surely it's different, must I go?

210
00:20:02,145 --> 00:20:07,288
呼吸揃えたら飛沫の中へ！
If we synchronize our breathing, into the spray!

211
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:14,934
君と　君と　唄っていたい
I want to sing with you, with you

212
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,689
戦の日それはきっと全てでなくて
The day of battle is surely not everything

213
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:20,033
帰り道見失わぬよう
So we don't lose our way back

214
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:25,922
聴いて　聴いて　その声聴いて
Listen, listen, listen to that voice

215
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:28,689
繋いでこの手を　還るよ明日に
Hold this hand, we'll return to tomorrow

216
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:31,945
きっと懐かしいあの場所へ
Surely to that nostalgic place

217
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:47,033
時の嵐の中で今
Now, in the storm of time

218
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:56,822
舞い散る花の涙
Falling petals of flower tears

219
00:20:57,478 --> 00:21:04,311
向かい風　今宵　花吹雪
A headwind, tonight a cherry blossom blizzard

220
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:10,011
積もる　積もる　白雪みたいに
Piling up, piling up, like white snow

221
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:15,400
優しく透きとおる時間のような
Like a gently transparent time

222
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:21,033
きっと　きっと　初雪みたいに
Surely, surely, like the first snow

223
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:27,711
忘れないよ一瞬を―
I won't forget this moment—

224
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:37,489
深く　深く　深雪のような
Deep, deep, like deep snow

225
00:21:38,211 --> 00:21:42,689
そう始まる前に知っていたこの痛み
Yes, this pain I knew before it started

226
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:45,300
今ならもっとずっと深く
Now, even much deeper

227
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:48,478
強く　強く　想い紡いで
Strongly, strongly, spinning my thoughts

228
00:21:48,656 --> 00:21:51,178
繋ぐよその手を　感じて明日を
I'll hold that hand, feeling tomorrow

229
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:56,311
静かな優しい海へきっと届け
Surely reach that quiet, gentle sea

230
00:21:56,578 --> 00:21:57,934
届け
Reach

231
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,711
君へと届け
Reach to you

232
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:04,278
泡へと届け
Reach to the sea foam

233
00:22:09,145 --> 00:22:16,145
デリケートに好きして
Love Me Delicately

234

作詞・作曲：古田 喜昭
Lyrics/Composition: Yoshiaki Furuta

235
00:22:28,689 --> 00:22:34,633
男の子とちがう　女の子って
Girls are different from boys

236
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:41,000
好きと嫌いだけで　普通がないの
With only 'like' and 'dislike', there's no 'normal'

237
00:22:42,378 --> 00:22:48,756
でも好きになったら　いくつかの
But when I fall in love, I'll show you

238
00:22:49,189 --> 00:22:53,833
魔法を見せるわ　本当よ
Some magic, really

239
00:22:57,478 --> 00:23:03,011
そうよ　女の子のハートは
That's right, a girl's heart is

240
00:23:04,189 --> 00:23:09,533
星空に　月の小舟浮かべ
Setting a moon-shaped boat afloat in the starry sky

241
00:23:10,578 --> 00:23:16,511
夢を探すこともできる
Even searching for dreams is possible

242
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:27,689
デリケートに好きして　デリケートに　好きして　好きして　好きして
Love me delicately, delicately, love me, love me, love me

243
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:45,933
嫌いと感じたら　手遅れみたい
If I feel like I dislike it, it seems too late

244
00:23:46,678 --> 00:23:52,600
サヨナラが心に　あふれてしまう
Goodbyes start overflowing in my heart

245
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:59,800
興味ない人と　一秒も
I can't stay for even a second

246
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:06,289
一緒にいられない　私達
With someone I'm not interested in, we can't

247
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:14,533
そうよ　女の子のハートは
That's right, a girl's heart is

248
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:21,478
七色に　光る虹のように
Like a rainbow shining in seven colors

249
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:28,189
風が吹くだけでも　変わる
Changing with even just a breath of wind

250
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:39,511
デリケートに好きして　デリケートに　好きして　好きして　好きして
Love me delicately, delicately, love me, love me, love me

251
00:24:42,511 --> 00:24:48,333
そうよ　女の子のハートは
That's right, a girl's heart is

252
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:54,511
星空に　月の小舟浮かべ
Setting a moon-shaped boat afloat in the starry sky

253
00:24:55,789 --> 00:25:01,722
夢を探すこともできる
Even searching for dreams is possible

254
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:05,833
デリケートに好きして
Please love me delicately

255
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:08,533
デリケートに好きして
Please love me delicately

256
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:12,533
好きして 好きして 好きして
Love me, love me, love me

259
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:50,883
我愛你 酔いが醒めない
Wo ai ni, I can't sober up

260
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:54,433
我愛你 恋が醒めない
Wo ai ni, this love won't wake up

261
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:57,733
お生憎様の慣れ果てで
In the ruins of a sorry state

262
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,933
察して
Guess it

263
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:03,483
無問題 破滅してみて
No problem, try to be destroyed

264
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:06,633
Hold me tight トラウマの味
Hold me tight, the taste of trauma

265
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:09,833
猛反対 お手お座りで
Strong opposition, give paw and sit

266
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:11,933
ハイ報酬
High reward

267
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:14,133
喉の奥がチクンチクン
My throat is pricking

268
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:15,733
僕はドクンドクン
I am thumping

269
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,633
喉の奥がチクンチクン
My throat is pricking

00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:18,933
僕はドクンドクン
I am thumping

271
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:23,933
鼓動で孤独消してみてよ
Try erasing loneliness with your heartbeat

272
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:28,433
愛も恋も独裁して
Dictate both love and romance

273
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:31,633
僕を独占して
Monopolize me

274
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:36,833
このまま中毒になるまでチューしよ
Let's keep kissing until we become addicted

275
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:40,633
そして Get get get on! Get get get on! Get on chu!
And Get get get on! Get get get on! Get on chu!

Get get get on! Get get get on! Get on chu!

277
00:26:43,733 --> 00:26:50,233
熱く とろけるくらいに 溢れた気持ちが たまらないでしょ
Hot and melting, these overflowing feelings are unbearable, right?

278
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:53,233
Get get get on! Get get get on! Get on chu!

279
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:56,033
Get get get on! Get get get on! Get on chu!

ポン・チー・カン 勝負はいつも
Pon, chi, kan, the match is always

283
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:09,533
トンチンカン 僕に言わせりゃ
Absurd, if you ask me

284
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:14,733
ちんぷんかんぷんだ 最後はロンでしょ？
It's all gibberish, in the end it's Ron, right?

285
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:18,633
もう何回？ 殺られればいい
How many more times? It's fine to be killed

286
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:21,933
Oh, One night 忘れられない
Oh, one night, I can't forget

287
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:27,033
終わんないで トキメキ 偏愛 予習
Don't end, heartbeat, partiality, preparation

288
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,433
喉の奥がチクンチクン
My throat is pricking

289
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:30,833
僕はドクンドクン
I am thumping

290
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:32,633
喉の奥がチクンチクン
My throat is pricking

291
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:33,933
僕はドクンドクン
I am thumping

292
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:39,133
心臓ごと引きずり出してみてよ
Try to drag it out with my heart

293
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:43,633
きもちいいね 面倒くさいけど
