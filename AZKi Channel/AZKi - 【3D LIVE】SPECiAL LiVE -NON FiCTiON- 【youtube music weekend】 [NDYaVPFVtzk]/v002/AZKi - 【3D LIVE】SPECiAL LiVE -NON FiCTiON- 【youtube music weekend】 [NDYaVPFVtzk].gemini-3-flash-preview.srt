YouTube music weekend
Special LIVE
NON-FICTION

3
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,300
皆さん、こんあずき！あずきです！
Hello, everyone! This is AZKi!

4
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,300
今日は一緒に盛り上がっていきましょう！
Let's get hyped together today!

5
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,800
はい！はい！はい！はい！
Hai! Hai! Hai! Hai!

6
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,400
仄暗い部屋の
In a dimly lit room

7
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,500
片隅で蹲る日々に
In the days spent huddling in a corner

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,300
夕焼けが射してる
The sunset is shining

9
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,300
午前二時半少し手前
A little before 2:30 AM

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,800
眠気に呑まれて
Swallowed by drowsiness

11
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,800
すべてを諦めてしまえば
If I were to give up on everything

12
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,500
愚か者は皆
All the fools

13
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,500
すぐに忘れ去っていくから
Will soon forget and leave

14
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,900
もう 日が昇ってしまう
Soon, the sun will rise

15
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,000
もう 明日が来てしまう
Soon, tomorrow will come

16
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,300
生きたくないと願った
In the moment I wished

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,300
瞬間にさ、ほら、誰かが死ぬ
That I didn't want to live, look, someone dies

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,300
分かっていたのに、どうして
I knew that, so why

19
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,300
どうして、どうして
Why, oh why?

20
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,300
世界はこんなにも 回る、回る、回る、回る
The world keeps revolving like this, round and round

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,800
目が眩んで おかしくなりそうよ
It's so dazzling, I feel like I'm going crazy

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,800
ーもう一度だけー
-Just one more time-

23
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,300
世界はこんなにも 廻る、廻る、廻る、廻る
The world keeps turning like this, again and again

24
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,500
息もできない
I can't even breathe

25
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,800
本当に私、疲れてしまったんだわ
I've really just become so tired

26
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,800
生きることに精一杯になりすぎてた
I was trying so hard just to live

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,800
私、今…
And now, I...

28
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,300
はい！はい！はい！はい！
Hai! Hai! Hai! Hai!

29
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,300
振り回す姿勢
The posture of waving around

30
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
四方にばらまいた感情
Emotions scattered in all directions

31
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,800
いない、ここにはいない
Not here, not in this place

32
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,300
嘘をついて、姿を消して
Telling lies, disappearing from sight

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,300
また 幾度繰り返す
Again, repeating over and over

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,300
また 後悔が重ねられる
Again, the regrets pile up

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,800
ゼロから1やり直し
Starting over from zero to one

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,300
生まれ変われば、なんて嘘とか
Lies like 'if I could be reborn'

37
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,300
分かってないのに、どうして
I don't even understand, so why

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,300
どうして、どうして
Why, oh why?

39
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,800
夜から朝
From night to morning

40
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,300
冬から夏
From winter to summer

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,800
あなたは泣きもせず、明日を待つ
You wait for tomorrow without even crying

42
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,300
少年少女たちが すれ違うことなく
The boys and girls, without ever passing each other

43
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,300
運命よ残酷だ、まま
Fate is cruel, just as it is

44
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,300
世界はこんなにも ひとつ、ふたつ、みっつ、よっつ
The world is so... one, two, three, four

45
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,300
いくつあるの
How many are there?

46
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,300
どれが正解なの？
Which one is the right answer?

47
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,800
世界はこんなにも 還る、還る、還る、還る
The world returns like this, back and back

48
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,300
目が解けて おかしくなりそうよ
My eyes are unravelling, I feel like I'm going crazy

49
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,800
ーあと一度だけー
-Just one more time-

50
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,300
世界はこんなにも 転がる、転がる、転がる、転がる
The world rolls like this, on and on

51
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,500
声にならない
It's beyond words

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,800
本当に私、叫んでしまったんだわ
I've really just ended up screaming

53
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,800
生きるために傷つけて確かめた
I hurt others just to live, and I confirmed it

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,800
私、今…
And now, I...

55
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,300
はい！はい！はい！はい！
Hai! Hai! Hai! Hai!

56
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
Rotate... Repeated...

57
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,300
不条理な生き方
An absurd way of living

58
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:09,133
…素晴らしき世界
...A wonderful world

59
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:11,733
イエスと言えば人間合格
Say "Yes" and you're a human qualification

60
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:15,433
笑えもっと　どんな顔だったっけ
Smile more, what kind of face was it again?

61
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:20,833
心のうちと鼓動
The heart within and its beat

62
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:35,933
非合法だ　聞かせて
It's illegal, let me hear it

63
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:40,533
素晴らしき世界
A wonderful world

64
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:43,233
ノーと言えば人間降格
Say "No" and you're a human demotion

65
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:47,033
素敵巧妙なシナリオだったっけ
Was it a wonderful, clever scenario?

66
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:51,333
終わりは突然に
The end comes suddenly

67
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:56,533
そして淡々と　過ぎて朽ちていく
And calmly, it passes and decays

68
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:08,533
くだらない日々は過ぎ　そう過ぎてゆく
Worthless days pass, yes, they pass by

69
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:13,033
そう決められたルールに
To the rules decided like that

70
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:18,533
そう従って　楽になって
Following them, getting easier

71

森に迷い込んでいたんだ
I was lost in the forest

72
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:39,333
非合法だ　聞かせて
It's illegal, let me hear it

73
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:43,833
素晴らしき世界
A wonderful world

74
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,533
イエスと答えて　人間合格
Answer "Yes" and you're a human qualification

75
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:50,033
神の愛は信じるものだけ
God's love is only for those who believe

76
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:55,333
罰を与えられてるんで
Because punishment is being given

77
00:06:55,333 --> 00:07:00,833
そして淡々と　過ぎて朽ちていく
And calmly, it passes and decays

78
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:12,533
叶えたい夢を捨て　そう夢を見て
Throwing away the dreams I want to fulfill, yes, dreaming

79

そう決められたルールに
To the rules decided like that

森に迷い込んでいくんだ

花が笑いながら言った　花が言った

君は泣いた　アスファルトを破り咲いた

森に迷い込んでいくんだ

偽物ばかりすべて
Everything is just fakes

96
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:26,533
上辺で飾って誤魔化して
Decorating the surface and deceiving

97
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:30,533
何が正解かわかんないから
Because I don't know what's right

98
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:34,033
壊れていく
It's breaking down

99
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:37,333
いったい何が本当なんだっけ
What on earth was real?

100
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,533
期待しても裏切られてばかり
Even if I expect something, I'm only betrayed

101
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:48,033
いつも泣いてしまうよ
I always end up crying

102

00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:11,645
満たされることないよ
I'll never be satisfied

109
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,645
虚像(Fake) だって
Even if it's a fake image

110
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:26,045
見慣れた景色さえも
Even the familiar scenery

111
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:29,345
空の色に染まってしまう
Becomes dyed in the color of the sky

112
00:10:30,245 --> 00:10:33,245

Because I don't know what's correct

113

縛られてしまう
I'm bound

114
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,245
一体何に本気なんだっけ
What exactly was I serious about?

115
00:10:40,345 --> 00:10:43,645
自問自答を繰り返して
Repeating self-questioning and self-answering

116
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:47,645
明日を夢見てる
Dreaming of tomorrow

117
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:54,245

自分を見失いそうだ
I'm about to lose myself

119
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:02,845

Without feeling any pain

救いの手はありますか
Is there a saving hand?

125
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:24,345
虚像(Fake) だって
Even if it's a fake image

126
00:11:25,345 --> 00:11:29,045
もう疲れてしまったよ
I'm already tired

127
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:32,845
何度でも
Any number of times

128
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:36,845
やり直せたらいいのに
If only I could start over

129
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,445

満たされることないよ
I'll never be satisfied

136
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:23,345
虚像(Fake) だって
Even if it's a fake image

137
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:30,345
全ては Fake
Everything is Fake

138
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:55,045

00:25:04,093 --> 00:25:05,333
叶えるかな
I'll make it come true

311
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,503
Dreaming Days

312
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:21,523
答えもない道をゆく
Walking a path with no answers

313
00:25:21,523 --> 00:25:24,613
誰も見たことのない世界
A world no one has ever seen

314
00:25:24,613 --> 00:25:28,253
連れていくよ
I'll take you there

315
00:25:28,253 --> 00:25:29,513
みんなのこと
all of you

316
00:25:29,513 --> 00:25:32,103
覚悟はいいかな
Are you ready?

317
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:35,633
手を離さないで
Don't let go of my hand

318
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:37,573
一人じゃないよ
I'm not alone

319
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:39,343
君が見ているから
because you're watching

320
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:42,253
初めての挑戦中だ
In the middle of my first challenge

321
00:25:42,253 --> 00:25:45,473
楽しくなっちゃうんだよ
It's getting to be fun

322
00:25:45,473 --> 00:25:47,013
We Dreaming!

323
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,113
Yeah!

324
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:51,333
奇跡を巻き起こすんだ Believe
I'll make miracles happen, Believe

325
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,133
夢に近づいて My Story
Getting closer to my dreams, My Story

326
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:58,433
とても小さな蕾が花咲かせるまで
Until a very small bud blooms

327
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,573
挑戦し続けるんだ Believe
I'll keep on challenging, Believe

328
00:26:01,573 --> 00:26:05,213
全力で飛び込もう
Let's dive in with all our might

329
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:08,813
ほんの少しだけの勇気が今
Just a little bit of courage now

330
00:26:08,813 --> 00:26:12,473
僕らを変えるんだ Dreaming Days
Will change us, Dreaming Days

331
00:26:25,773 --> 00:26:29,413
選んできた未来の選択肢
The choices for the future I've made

332
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:33,713
すべてがほら私を作った
Everything, you see, made me who I am

333
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:39,273
選ぶことのなかった中にさえ
Even among the things I didn't choose

334
00:26:39,273 --> 00:26:42,833
大事な意味があったと気づいたよ
I realized there was an important meaning

335
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:51,473
涙を流した数がEmotion
The number of tears shed is Emotion

336
00:26:51,473 --> 00:26:54,113
熱い鼓動がOverheat
Hot heartbeat is Overheat

337
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:58,213
本気だからこそ思える
I can feel this way precisely because I'm serious

338
00:26:58,213 --> 00:27:01,303
トップになりたい
I want to be at the top

339
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:05,173
未来へ走り出したら Fantastic
If I start running towards the future, it's Fantastic

340
00:27:05,173 --> 00:27:08,233
全力で楽しもう
Let's enjoy with all our might

341
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:12,273
それはいつかきっと大きな夢
That will surely one day be a big dream

342
00:27:12,273 --> 00:27:15,673
叶えるかな
I'll make it come true

343
00:27:15,673 --> 00:27:18,573
Dreaming Days Oh Yeah

344
00:27:18,573 --> 00:27:22,373
走り続けていくんだ Greatest
I'll keep on running, Greatest

345
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:26,473
一人じゃ届かない高みへ
To heights I can't reach alone

346
00:27:26,473 --> 00:27:28,493
Yeah!

347
00:27:41,403 --> 00:27:43,093
ありがとう！
Thank you!

348
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:54,593
ありがとう。
Thank you.

349
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:58,503
はい、ということで、
Alright, so,

350
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:00,213
AZKiお水タイム！
it's AZKi's water time!

351
00:28:00,213 --> 00:28:02,303
お水、お水。
Water, water.

352
00:28:06,213 --> 00:28:07,213
はい。
Alright.

353
00:28:07,213 --> 00:28:10,213
みんなもお水を補給してもらって。
Everyone, please replenish your water too.

354
00:28:10,503 --> 00:28:11,503
ふふっ。
(Laughs)

355
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:15,503
はい、ということでちょっとまたMCなんですけれども
Okay, so it's time for another MC segment,

356
00:28:15,503 --> 00:28:19,913
ちょっとね、なんか、なんかこう、改まって、
but I wanted to take a moment

357
00:28:19,913 --> 00:28:24,503
なんかちょっとみんなに、こういう場で、ちょっとお話、なんか、しようと思って
to formally talk to you all like this.

358
00:28:25,113 --> 00:28:29,303
ちょっとね、最近ちょっと考えていることを、ここで、
I'd like to talk about some things I've been thinking about lately,

359
00:28:29,303 --> 00:28:32,213
深夜の... 深夜のテンションでちょっとお話したいと、思っています。
with my... my late-night energy.

360
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:33,213
はい。
Yes.

361
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:38,303
えっと先日、えっと私の大好きな可不ちゃんのですね、
Um, the other day, after my dear KAFU-chan's...

362
00:28:38,303 --> 00:28:42,303
あの不解不2のリビ・リビルディングか、が終わってから
'FUKAIFU 2 REBUILDING' ended,

363
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:46,213
えっと、そう、AZKiのライブとか、その、
I've been thinking about AZKi's lives and...

364
00:28:46,213 --> 00:28:51,433
普段一緒に活動しているAZKiチーム의、なんかこう、良さってなんだろうなー、ということをですね、
...what makes the AZKi team I work with special.

365
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:55,333
とてもとても、とてもとても考えまして
I've been thinking about it a lot.

366
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:59,303
そう、めちゃくちゃ、あのね、話したりしてたんですけど。はい。
Yeah, I've been talking about it quite a bit. Yes.

367
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,333
なんか、どう、なんかこう、可不ちゃんのライブとかって、
I feel like KAFU-chan's lives have

368
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:06,213
すごくすごく、なんかこう、物語とか、
this incredible sense of story

369
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:11,213
なんかこう、圧倒的な、なんか、なんだろうな、世界観とか、なんかそういうのが、あると思っていて
and an overwhelming worldview, or something like that.

370
00:29:11,213 --> 00:29:14,303
それがすごくAZKiは好きで、
I really love that,

371
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:18,333
なんかいつもね、もう、心を鷲掴みにされ、
and my heart is always gripped by it,

372
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:23,503
え、もうなんか、しばらく放心状態みたいな、ことがよくあるんですけど
and I often end up in a daze for a while afterward.

373
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:27,333
なんかまあ、AZKiチームで、まあ、なんかそういうの、
And I wondered if the AZKi team,

374
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:31,503
自分たちには、なんか、まあ、ない、というか、
well, if we lacked that,

375
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:35,613
まあ、ないかなーっていうことで、思ったりとか、
or if we were just trying to catch up to it.

376
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:38,303
まあ、それに、まあ追いつこうとなんかしたりとか
Or something like that.

377
00:29:38,613 --> 00:29:42,503
なんかそういう、なんだろうな。自分たちが、こう...
Like, what is it? Our...

378
00:29:42,503 --> 00:29:47,733
可不ちゃんは可不ちゃんの、可不ちゃんチームは可不ちゃんチームの良さがあって、
KAFU-chan and her team have their own unique strengths,

379
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:52,503
じゃあ、AZKiチーム、AZKiの良さってなんだろうなっていうのを
so I recently had another chance to think about

380
00:29:52,503 --> 00:29:56,333
すごく、最近、また改めて、考えるきっかけを、頂いたなーと思っていて。
what makes the AZKi team and AZKi special.

381
00:29:56,613 --> 00:30:00,213
そう、それでね、なんか、どう、どうなんだろうな。
Yeah, so, I wonder what it is.

382
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:04,093
AZKi、AZKi、AZKiって、なんだろうね。
What exactly is AZKi?

383
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:07,238
なんか、こう、なんかそれの、なんか劣化版というか...
Something like... well, like a degraded version of that...

384
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:10,438
...なんか、模倣でしか、なんかちょっと、なかったりとか...
...or just something like... a bit of an imitation...

385
00:30:10,438 --> 00:30:15,638
...なんかね、実際そうやって思うところが、まあ、あるわけですよ。
...you know, there are actually times when I feel that way.

386
00:30:15,638 --> 00:30:19,638
まあ、いろいろね、活動している中で、いろんなものを目に、して...
Well, while doing various activities and seeing various things...

387
00:30:19,638 --> 00:30:24,338
...体験して、自分たちはどうだろう、って、結構振り返ることがあるんですけど...
...and experiencing them, I often look back and think, "how about us?" but...

388
00:30:24,338 --> 00:30:29,638
でも、なんかそんな中で、まあ、こうやって開拓者のみんなが...
But, in the midst of all that, well, having all the Pioneers like this...

389
00:30:29,638 --> 00:30:34,338
...AZKiのことを、なんでこう、なんで、なんでって言うと失礼かもしれないんですけど...
...supporting AZKi—saying "why" might be rude, but...

390
00:30:34,338 --> 00:30:39,638
なんか、なんで応援してくれているんだろう、ということを考えましてですね...
...I've been thinking about why you all support me...

391
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:42,938
...考え、て...
...thinking about it...

392
00:30:42,938 --> 00:30:46,938
まぁ、でもそこ、それってきっと...
Well, but that's probably...

393
00:30:46,938 --> 00:30:51,238
あの、歌が好きだったりとか、こうやって、なんか普段話してる感じが、好きだったりとか...
...that you like my songs, or you like the way I usually talk...

394
00:30:51,238 --> 00:30:55,338
...いろいろあると思うんですけど。
...I'm sure there are many reasons.

395
00:30:55,338 --> 00:31:00,838
なんかこう、昔からね、まずっと一緒に歩いてくれているみんなは...
For those who have been walking with me for a long time...

396
00:31:00,838 --> 00:31:07,038
...こう何だろうな、まあ、最初から比べるとめちゃくちゃに、変化したと思うんですよ。AZKiも。
...well, I think I've changed immensely since the beginning. AZKi has.

397
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:14,338
歴史を辿ると、いろんなことがあって、まあ、そういう、何だろうな、変化っていうのを...
Looking back at history, so many things happened, and that, well, kind of change...

398
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:22,338
...一緒にこうやって楽しんで、くれているのかな、というふうに思って...
...is something you've been enjoying with me, I think...

399
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,338
...思って、いまして。
...I've been thinking.

400
00:31:25,338 --> 00:31:29,338
だからやっぱり、常にね...
That's why, after all, always...

401
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:35,338
...なんかこう、目標とか、なんかこう、新しい姿とか、挑戦とか、なんか変化し続け、ないといけないし...
...like, goals, or a new look, or challenges, I have to keep changing...

402
00:31:35,338 --> 00:31:42,038
...まあ、だからね、こうやって新しい、衣装になってからもね、こう...
...and that's why, even after getting this new outfit, you know...

403
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:47,338
...あの応援し始めてくれた、開拓者のみんなは、いると思うんですけど...
...I'm sure there are Pioneers who started supporting me from then, but...

404
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:53,938
...えーと、そういう、なんかその、いろんな場面でこうやってAZKiに出会ってくれた開拓者のみんなと...
...um, with all the Pioneers who have met AZKi in various situations like that...

405
00:31:53,938 --> 00:32:00,338
...これからも、えーと、一緒に変化っていうのを、なんか楽しんでいきたいなと、思っています。
...I want to continue enjoying this "change" together from now on.

406
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:04,438
なんか、ね、こう、ライブを重ねるごとにね、なんかその日、歌う、曲はさ...
You know, with every live performance, the songs I sing that day...

407
00:32:04,438 --> 00:32:10,238
...なんかちょっと、違ったりとか、なんかその日、その日で、ライブも、なんか何だろうな...
...are a bit different, and from day to day, the live shows are, what can I say...

408
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:16,438
...作り上げる、ものが、違ったりするので。
...the things we create are different.

409
00:32:16,438 --> 00:32:22,338
まあそういう、なんか日々の、成長とかも、なんか楽しんでもらえたら、いいなって、思っています。
So, those kinds of daily growths... are things I hope you can enjoy too.

410
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:30,338
うんと、あと、私たちはね、まあこの、この、ね、世界で、まあ今大変で、いろんなことが、起こっていると思うんですけど...
And, also, we are, well, in this world, and things are tough now, so many things are happening...

411
00:32:30,338 --> 00:32:38,338
まあ、あの、世の中、なんかこう楽しいこととか、まあ、寂しいこととか...
Well, you know, in the world, there are fun things, and well, lonely things...

412
00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:44,338
...なんか変わってしまってどうしようもないこととか、いろいろ、いろいろみんな、いろんな状況で...
...things that have changed and can't be helped, and everyone is in various situations...

413
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:48,838
...大変だったり、すると思うんですけど。
...and it must be tough, I think.

414
00:32:48,838 --> 00:32:55,338
まあ、その、なんか、そういったこととかを、なんか元気づけられたりとか、AZKiが元気づけられたりとか...
Well, um, through things like that, I hope I can cheer you up, or AZKi gets cheered up...

415
00:32:55,338 --> 00:33:01,038
...まあちゃんと一つ一つ、えーと、しっかり向き合って、なんかこう...
...and facing each thing properly, um, and like...

416
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:08,338
...AZKiはここにいたんだぞ、っていう、あの生きた証を、刻んでいこう、と...
...I'll leave a mark, a proof of life that "AZKi was here," and...

417
00:33:08,338 --> 00:33:13,338
...いうことが、なんか、とても、大事なんだなと、思っています。
...that's something I think is very important.

418
00:33:13,338 --> 00:33:19,638
えー、だからこそ、こうやって開拓者のみんなの、なんか一つ一つのコメントとか...
That's exactly why, having each of the Pioneers' comments like this...

419
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:26,338
...えーと、そういうのを大事にして、これからも頑張っていきたいと、思っています。
...um, I want to cherish those and keep doing my best from now on.

420
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:32,338
まあ、この世界はね、うーん、ノンフィクション。今日のライブタイトルにもありますけど...
Well, this world is, hmm, Non-Fiction. As in the title of today's live...

421
00:33:32,338 --> 00:33:36,438
ノンフィクションです。えーと、厳しいこともたくさんあるんですけど...
It's Non-Fiction. Um, there are many harsh things, but...

422
00:33:36,438 --> 00:33:44,338
今、AZKiが歌っていて、えー、開拓者のみんなが応援してくれて、場所や、時間をこうやって飛び越えて...
Right now, AZKi is singing, and all the Pioneers are supporting me, and leaping across place and time like this...

423
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:56,338
...いろんな気持ちを、まあ共、共有か、共有することができるっていうのは、とってもとっても、かけがえのないことだと思います。
...to share, being able to share various feelings is something I think is very, very irreplaceable.

424
00:33:56,338 --> 00:34:04,238
ひとつひとつの出来事を大切に、うーん、5年後、10年後...
Cherishing each event, hmm, 5 years, 10 years later...

425
00:34:04,238 --> 00:34:13,638
...10年後、もっともっと、その先も、なんかこういうことがあったな、って、思い出せる...
...10 years later, even further beyond that, I hope we can remember that things like this happened...

426
00:34:13,638 --> 00:34:18,038
...なんか、こう、キラキラ、キラキラした、思い出を、たくさん作っていこうね。
...let's make lots of sparkling, sparkling memories, okay?

427
00:34:18,038 --> 00:34:22,338
いこうね、いこうね、はい。えーと、ちょっと長々とお話ししたんですけれども...
Let's do it, let's do it, yes. Um, I've talked for quite a while, but...

428
00:34:22,338 --> 00:34:31,338
...そんな、思いを込めて、えー、すべての才能ある命に、歌いたいと、思います。
...with those feelings in mind, um, I'd like to sing to all talented lives.

429
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:35,038
聴いてください。「いのち」。
Please listen. "Inochi".

430
00:34:39,238 --> 00:34:42,738
息をしている
Breathing

431
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:46,038
君は生きている
You are alive

432
00:34:46,038 --> 00:34:51,238
当然のことだね 誰も疑わないの
It's only natural, no one doubts it

433
00:34:51,238 --> 00:34:54,638
息をしている
Breathing

434
00:34:54,638 --> 00:34:57,938
ように見えている
Or so it seems

435
00:34:57,938 --> 00:35:03,338
生の裏側 私にとっての何か
The flip side of life, what it means to me

436
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:06,846
鼓動がトクトクしている
My heart is beating fast

437
00:35:07,896 --> 00:35:11,496
叩かれても腐らずに
Even if I'm criticized, I won't give up

438
00:35:12,296 --> 00:35:15,596
ここで歌うよ
I'll sing here

439
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:20,396
ボタンひとつの気持ち
The feeling of a single button

440
00:35:21,196 --> 00:35:26,496
最後まで私のこと覚えててくれるの？
Will you remember me until the end?

441
00:35:26,796 --> 00:35:29,296
消えてしまいそうなの
It seems like I'm about to disappear

442
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:32,596
分かってよ分かってよ ねえ
Understand me, understand me, hey

443
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:35,196
淡々と踊るの
Dancing indifferently

444
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,696
恋しさは違うでしょ
Longing is different, right?

445
00:35:37,796 --> 00:35:40,096
君が忘れちゃったら
If you forget me

446
00:35:40,196 --> 00:35:42,796
私は痛くなるの
I'll start to feel the pain

447
00:35:43,196 --> 00:35:48,296
命のような夢を見てるよ
I'm dreaming a dream like life itself

448
00:35:48,796 --> 00:35:51,796
またね バイバイ
See you again, bye-bye

449
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:07,696
息をしている
I am breathing

450
00:36:07,896 --> 00:36:11,096
だから生きてる
That's why I'm living

451
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:15,096
自己証明を欲しがって 欲しがっているんだ
I'm longing for, longing for self-proof

452
00:36:15,196 --> 00:36:16,996
音が止まって
The sound stops

453
00:36:17,096 --> 00:36:20,096
動かなくなって
And I stop moving

454
00:36:20,196 --> 00:36:24,596
そんな私を君は笑ってくれるかな
I wonder if you'll laugh at me then

455
00:36:25,196 --> 00:36:30,496
鼓動がトクトクしている
My heart is beating fast

456
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:36,496
嫌われても腐らずに
Even if I'm hated, I won't give up

457
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:40,096
ここで歌うよ
I'll sing here

458
00:36:40,296 --> 00:36:44,896
気分次第な命
Life that depends on the mood

459
00:36:45,796 --> 00:36:51,096
最後まで私のこと見届けてくれるの？
Will you watch over me until the very end?

460
00:36:51,396 --> 00:36:53,896
褪めてしまいそうなの
It seems like I'm about to fade away

461
00:36:53,996 --> 00:36:56,796
分かってよ分かってよ ねえ
Understand me, understand me, hey

462
00:36:56,896 --> 00:36:59,296
声が聞こえるんだよ
I can hear your voice

463
00:36:59,396 --> 00:37:02,596
塩辛い涙が出ちゃうほど
So much that salty tears flow out

464
00:37:02,796 --> 00:37:05,296
君が忘れちゃったら
If you forget me

465
00:37:05,396 --> 00:37:07,696
私は痛くなるの
I'll start to feel the pain

466
00:37:07,896 --> 00:37:12,896
命のような夢を見てるよ
I'm dreaming a dream like life itself

467
00:37:13,296 --> 00:37:16,396
またね バイバイ
See you again, bye-bye

468
00:37:17,096 --> 00:37:21,296
塞ぎ込んだあの日を
That day when I was feeling down

469
00:37:21,396 --> 00:37:25,296
軽く弄らないで 止めて
Don't tease me about it lightly, stop it

470
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:32,796
それが生きる糧になるから
Because that becomes my strength to live

471
00:37:36,996 --> 00:37:39,196
大丈夫
It's okay

472
00:37:39,296 --> 00:37:45,296
ずっと私は歌い続けるから
Because I'll keep singing forever

473
00:37:52,496 --> 00:37:57,396
最後まで私は生きてるか分からないけど
I don't know if I'll be alive until the end, but

474
00:37:57,596 --> 00:38:02,296
君がくれた言葉は確かに残ってる
The words you gave me certainly remain

475
00:38:02,896 --> 00:38:08,196
最後まで私のこと覚えててくれるの？
Will you remember me until the end?

476
00:38:08,396 --> 00:38:13,396
いつ死んでしまうかなんて 分かんない分かんないよ ねえ
I don't know, I don't know when I'll die, hey

477
00:38:13,996 --> 00:38:18,596
痛いくらい気持ちがシンクロする時もあるけど
There are times when our feelings synchronize so much it hurts

478
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,196
君が忘れちゃったら
If you forget me

479
00:38:21,296 --> 00:38:23,596
私は痛くなるの
I'll start to feel the pain

480
00:38:23,796 --> 00:38:28,896
命のような夢を見てるよ
I'm dreaming a dream like life itself

481
00:38:29,396 --> 00:38:32,796
またね バイバイ
See you again, bye-bye

482
00:39:34,796 --> 00:39:36,296
ちいさななるが決めたこと
What the little one decided

483
00:39:46,996 --> 00:39:52,496
あの日選んで君が道は間違いだったんだって 過去恨んでみても
Even if you regret the past, thinking the path you chose that day was a mistake

484
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:02,296
土砂降りの雨が責めたって
Even if the downpouring rain blames you

485
00:40:02,473 --> 00:40:03,848
俯いた顔は
With a downcast face

486
00:40:03,848 --> 00:40:08,198
ひどく弱いことに気づいたら
Once I realized how terribly weak I was

487
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:15,723
この先には叶えたいことや夢があるから
Because ahead of me, there are dreams and things I want to achieve

488
00:40:16,423 --> 00:40:20,173
目を逸らさないように
So that I don't look away

489
00:40:20,173 --> 00:40:24,248
正解はない 誰だって一人で
There's no right answer; everyone's alone

490
00:40:24,248 --> 00:40:29,498
思うまま始まっていく この物語
This story begins just as we wish

491
00:40:30,673 --> 00:40:33,923
今をただ走って
Just running through the present

492
00:40:33,923 --> 00:40:37,073
季節を駆け巡って
Running through the seasons

493
00:40:37,073 --> 00:40:40,673
見えない暗闇の中で
In the unseen darkness

494
00:40:41,323 --> 00:40:42,773
痛みだってあるよ
There will be pain

495
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,473
戸惑いだってあるよ
There will be confusion

496
00:40:45,473 --> 00:40:54,223
それでもここで生きていくと 決めたんだ
Even so, I've decided to live right here

497
00:40:57,123 --> 00:41:00,573
決めたから
Because I've decided

498
00:41:01,623 --> 00:41:04,748
前を向いて
I'll look forward

499
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:18,573
生き方を誰が決めていて
Who decides how we should live?

500
00:41:18,573 --> 00:41:24,173
本当はそうじゃなかったとか今更嘆いたって
It's too late to lament that it wasn't really like that

501
00:41:25,223 --> 00:41:29,173
味方もヒーローも現れなくて
No allies or heroes appear

502
00:41:29,173 --> 00:41:34,973
喧騒の中でどこか彷徨いかけていたんだ
I was about to wander off somewhere in the bustle

503
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:42,173
この先には奏でたい音や歌があるから
Because ahead of me, there are sounds and songs I want to play

504
00:41:43,123 --> 00:41:45,998
耳を澄ますように
I'll listen closely

505
00:41:45,998 --> 00:41:50,823
間違いはない 誰だって一人で
There's no mistake; everyone's alone

506
00:41:50,823 --> 00:41:56,148
綴り綴られていく この物語
This story is being written and woven

507
00:41:57,323 --> 00:42:00,498
過去今未来が
Past, present, and future

508
00:42:00,498 --> 00:42:03,623
あなたを駆け巡って
Run through you

509
00:42:03,623 --> 00:42:07,223
理想と現実の中で
In between ideal and reality

510
00:42:07,873 --> 00:42:09,323
泣きたくもなるよ
Sometimes I want to cry

511
00:42:09,323 --> 00:42:11,973
諦めたくなるよ
Sometimes I want to give up

512
00:42:11,973 --> 00:42:20,748
それでもここで生きていくと 決めたんだ
Even so, I've decided to live right here

513
00:42:23,873 --> 00:42:26,873
決めたから
Because I've decided

514
00:42:28,248 --> 00:42:30,823
走り出すよ
I'll start running

515
00:42:45,998 --> 00:42:50,723
生まれ変わっても この話をしよう
Even if I'm reborn, let's tell this story

516
00:42:50,723 --> 00:42:56,423
この人生で良かったと
Saying that I'm glad I had this life

517
00:42:56,973 --> 00:42:59,723
痛みは力に
Pain into strength

518
00:42:59,723 --> 00:43:02,423
戸惑いは期待に
Confusion into expectation

519
00:43:02,423 --> 00:43:06,723
そうしてここで生きていくと
And so, I'll live right here

520
00:43:07,273 --> 00:43:10,473
今をただ走って
Just running through the present

521
00:43:10,473 --> 00:43:13,723
季節を駆け巡って
Running through the seasons

522
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:17,298
見えない暗闇の中で
In the unseen darkness

523
00:43:17,948 --> 00:43:19,398
痛みだってあるよ
There will be pain

524
00:43:19,398 --> 00:43:22,048
戸惑いだってあるよ
There will be confusion

525
00:43:22,048 --> 00:43:30,823
それでもここで生きていくと 決めたんだ
Even so, I've decided to live right here

526
00:43:33,923 --> 00:43:37,073
決めたから
Because I've decided

527
00:43:38,323 --> 00:43:40,873
前を向いて
I'll look forward

528
00:43:59,184 --> 00:44:00,248
ありがとう。
Thank you.

529
00:44:00,948 --> 00:44:03,848
はい、ということでお送りしたのは
Yes, and so those songs were

530
00:44:03,848 --> 00:44:09,148
「命」と「小さな心が決めたこと」でした。
'Life' and 'What a Small Heart Decided'.

531
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:14,448
なんと、なんとね、このセカンドの衣装に
And would you look at that, into this second outfit,

532
00:44:14,448 --> 00:44:17,948
チェンジして歌わせていただきました。
I changed and performed for you.

533
00:44:19,048 --> 00:44:24,248
はい、ということで早いものでラスト3曲ということで、
Yes, and so, time flies, and we're down to the last three songs.

534
00:44:24,948 --> 00:44:30,248
ここからはノンストップで行きたいと思っているので、
From here, I'd like to go non-stop,

535
00:44:30,748 --> 00:44:32,748
MCはこれで最後になります。
so this will be the last MC section.

536
00:44:33,248 --> 00:44:36,248
その前にお水を飲もう。お水、お水。
Before that, let me drink some water. Water, water.

537
00:44:38,448 --> 00:44:39,948
ふあ〜！
Phew!

538
00:44:41,748 --> 00:44:45,948
時空を超えた映像、
Footage that transcended spacetime...

539
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:49,048
時空を超えてお水を飲んできました。
I've come back from drinking water across spacetime.

540
00:44:50,248 --> 00:44:54,748
はい、ということでサード…サード衣装にチェンジしまして、
Yes, and so, I've changed into my third... third outfit,

541
00:44:54,748 --> 00:45:00,248
ラスト3曲をお届けしたいと思います。
and I'd like to perform the last three songs.

542
00:45:00,693 --> 00:45:03,593
お話しした通りなんですけど...
As I mentioned...

543
00:45:04,193 --> 00:45:09,193
えっと、今日はこのスペシャルライブ
NON FiCTiONということで...
Um, today is this special live,
"NON FiCTiON"...

544
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:16,193
ノンフィクションなこの世界で、えー、
変化し続けることを大切にしていきたいし...
In this non-fiction world, I want to
value continuing to change...

545
00:45:16,893 --> 00:45:20,193
こういうね、非日常のこういうライブ、
あ、もちろん...
This kind of extraordinary live show, and of course...

546
00:45:20,693 --> 00:45:28,193
ま、普段やっているAZKiんちの日常の配信でも、
どんどん変化していけるようになりたいと思います！
even in my usual daily streams at "AZKi-nchi",
I want to be able to keep changing more and more!

547
00:45:28,693 --> 00:45:35,193
えー、開拓者のみんなと一緒に
足跡を残していきたいと思っています！
I want to continue leaving footprints
together with all you Pioneers!

548
00:45:35,893 --> 00:45:40,193
だからこれからも一緒に歩いていこうね！
So let's keep walking together from now on, okay?

549
00:45:41,193 --> 00:45:44,893
それでは聞いてください。in this world。
Now, please listen. "in this world."

550
00:45:55,193 --> 00:46:00,493
綻ぶ言葉を見失ってる
I'm losing sight of the words that bloom

551
00:46:00,893 --> 00:46:06,193
空が涙を降らせていたんだ
The sky was letting tears fall

552
00:46:06,593 --> 00:46:10,693
誰のために 何のために
For whom? For what purpose?

553
00:46:11,193 --> 00:46:16,193
これが運命だと言うの？
Is this what you call destiny?

554
00:46:16,493 --> 00:46:21,693
嘘が街を包み込んでいる
Lies are enveloping the city

555
00:46:21,893 --> 00:46:27,193
鳥が飛べずに声を上げていた
The birds, unable to fly, were raising their voices

556
00:46:27,393 --> 00:46:31,693
たった一つの存在を灯す
Lighting up a single existence

557
00:46:31,993 --> 00:46:37,193
この場所で君を待ってる
I'm waiting for you in this place

558
00:46:37,693 --> 00:46:41,693
世界はとても苦しそうでした
The world seemed very painful

559
00:46:41,893 --> 00:46:46,693
私に何ができるというの？
What can I possibly do?

560
00:46:46,993 --> 00:46:47,993
歌うことが正しいかなんて
Whether singing is the right thing to do...

561
00:46:47,993 --> 00:46:49,493
確かなのは君がいたから
What's certain is that because you were here

562
00:46:49,693 --> 00:46:51,193
私はここにいるの
I am here

563
00:46:51,693 --> 00:46:53,693
何回何十回だって
No matter how many times

564
00:46:54,193 --> 00:46:59,193
君と出会うから
Because I'll meet you

565
00:46:59,893 --> 00:47:05,193
夜が明けていく光が降り注ぎ
The night breaks into dawn, light pouring down

566
00:47:05,393 --> 00:47:10,193
喜び悲しみを抱え前を向く
Embracing joy and sorrow, looking forward

567
00:47:10,693 --> 00:47:14,893
君と生きてくここでこの場所で
I'll live with you here, in this place

568
00:47:15,193 --> 00:47:19,693
それが私の世界だ
That is my world

569
00:47:19,993 --> 00:47:30,693
その一秒一瞬が煌めく yeah
Every second, every moment shines, yeah

570
00:47:34,193 --> 00:47:39,193
過去が道を壊したとしても
Even if the past destroyed the path

571
00:47:39,493 --> 00:47:43,693
夢が街を食らい尽くそうとしても
Even if dreams are about to devour the city

572
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:49,193
大丈夫だからそばにいるよ
It's okay, because I'm by your side

573
00:47:49,693 --> 00:47:54,193
君に笑ってほしいんだ
I want you to smile

574
00:47:54,693 --> 00:47:59,193
生まれた意味を探しているの
I'm searching for the meaning of being born

575
00:47:59,693 --> 00:48:04,693
転んでもただ走り続けていく
Even if I fall, I'll just keep on running

576
00:48:04,993 --> 00:48:10,193
今を信じて明日を描いた
Believing in the now, I drew tomorrow

577
00:48:10,493 --> 00:48:15,193
心が叫びたがってる
My heart wants to shout

578
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:19,693
タイムマシンに乗ってさ
別の未来を選ぶことが出来たなら
If I could have taken a time machine
and chosen a different future

579
00:48:19,893 --> 00:48:24,693
君のいない世界を創造する？
そんな世界は想像できない
Would I create a world without you?
I can't imagine such a world.

580
00:48:24,993 --> 00:48:30,193
君に届きますように
この声がこの歌が
May it reach you, this voice, this song

581
00:48:30,693 --> 00:48:37,193
何回何十回だって君を選ぶから
Because no matter how many times, I'll choose you

582
00:48:37,693 --> 00:48:42,693
夜が滲んでいく地平の彼方へ
The night blurs toward the horizon

583
00:48:42,893 --> 00:48:48,193
響く呼吸の音を確かに感じた
I clearly felt the sound of breathing echoing

584
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:53,193
始めよう君とこの未来を
Let's begin, this future with you

585
00:48:53,493 --> 00:48:57,193
繋いだ手を離さないで
Don't let go of our joined hands

586
00:48:57,693 --> 00:49:04,193
大きな声で名前を呼んで
Call my name with a loud voice

587
00:49:04,493 --> 00:49:09,693
奇跡を駆け抜けて
Running through miracles

588
00:49:09,993 --> 00:49:15,193
どこまでも行けるよ
We can go anywhere

589
00:49:16,693 --> 00:49:21,893
ここからもう一度 君と私で始めよう
Let's start once more from here, you and me

590
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:26,893
無限の中に生まれた物語を 君と歩いていく
Walking with you through the story
born in infinity

591
00:49:27,193 --> 00:49:31,893
この世界が悲しみに溢れたとしても
Even if this world is overflowing with sadness

592
00:49:32,193 --> 00:49:36,893
私は歌を歌い続けていく
I will continue to sing my song

傷つき涙を流す君が 幸せだと思える世界へ
To a world where you, hurt and crying,
can feel happy

今を動かせる
I can move the present

602
00:51:04,018 --> 00:51:09,318
暗闇を手探りで 不安と焦燥の中
Groping through the darkness, amidst anxiety and impatience

603
00:51:09,618 --> 00:51:15,018
こぼれる光を見た
I saw the overflowing light

604

声が枯れるまで叫んで
Screaming until my voice gives out

614
00:52:12,018 --> 00:52:16,618
言葉に傷つけられ 涙がこぼれるのは
