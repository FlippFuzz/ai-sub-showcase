3D SHOWCASE
#3DKirin
Ceres Fauna

3
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:27,500
Ring-a-ring-o' roses, fa-la-la-la,
round and round, fa-la-la-la,

4
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
jumping up and down, fa-la-la-la,
koko ni... te...
jumping up and down, fa-la-la-la,
here I... am...

5
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,400
Hey, aren't you here early?

6
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,200
Wait, or perhaps am I late?

7
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,600
Welcome to my 3D showcase, everyone!

8
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,400
Thank you for showing up right on time.

9
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,800
I'm ready, I promise, I'm ready.

10
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,200
We have a lot of fun stuff planned for today.

11
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,300
It means a lot to me that you came to see me.

12
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,700
Here I am, in 3D, for you!

13
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,800
I have a lot to show off today,

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,300
including myself, but also this beautiful forest,

15
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,800
to which I call home, which I can finally show to you.

16
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,800
I'm excited!

17
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,200
And if you're also excited and you want to talk about the stream,

18
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,300
feel free to post with the hashtag #3DKirin,

19
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,800
which you can see on the screen somewhere.

20
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,200
And while I'm here for you in 3D,

21
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,300
do you have any pose requests you would like to see from me?

22
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,800
I'm taking your requests right now, so you better get them in while you can.

23
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,300
What do you think? What do you think?

24
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,800
I'm in a generous mood right now. I just might even do the splits for you.

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,300
Don't think I've forgotten. I remember. I remember.

26
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,500
You want to see? Okay, I said I was generous, but...

27
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,200
...but am I really so generous? I don't know.

28
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,100
Splits? Is there a way to do the splits in a, a ladylike manner?

29
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,100
Well, there's two methods. You can, you can go this way.

30
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,500
That's more of a lunge. Or you can go this way.

31
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,800
Maybe, maybe we scrap that one.

32
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,500
Do you have any idol-like pose requests for me?

33
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,400
Mermaid pose? No.

34
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,400
I'm not doing mermaid pose. No mermaid pose.

35
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,200
A slap. You want to be slapped.

36
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,200
I shouldn't be surprised at this point.

37
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,300
All right, come here. Come here.

38
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,400
Hoo-cha!

39
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,800
You want another one? You want another one?
That wasn't enough for you?

40
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,300
Hoo-cha!

41
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,200
All right, all right. I think that was enough of that.

42
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,400
Let me show you around a little bit.

43
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,300
Hopefully you're not too, too dazed from the slaps.

44
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,200
We have in my lovely forest many features,

45
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,800
such as a fountain. Perfect ASMR ambiance.

46
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,200
Lots of bubbles. Mm-hm.

47
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,400
Not only do we have a fountain... well, first of all,

48
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,200
there are so many beautiful flowers around.

49
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,600
And this giant tree! The World Tree has finally been complete.

50
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,800
I built it. I built it myself. I did that.

51
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,400
I'm nature. I did that.

52
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,800
We also have a bench. Beautiful feature.

53
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,400
And a gazebo! How many hit points do you think this thing has?

54
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:56,800
I bet it wouldn't even flinch if I hit it with an arrow. Very scary.

55
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,333
But...

56
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:05,433
I think I'm not the only one in this forest.

57
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:08,533
Hmm, could it be?

58
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:12,133
Nemu, come out, come out, wherever you are.

59
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:15,033
Are you sleeping again, Nemu?

60
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,833
(Gasps)

61
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:22,533
She's cute, she's cute, she's really cute!

62
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,433
Look at you, Nemu, just look at you.

63
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:27,433
Oh...

64
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,633
Hey, where you going? Hey!

65
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,433
I'm trying to pet you.

66
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,633
Where are you off to?

67
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:37,433
Is my 3D showcase not yours?

68
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:41,833
Don't get a big head. You know I'm the real Keeper of Nature, right?

69
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:46,533
Where are you going? Where are you going?

70
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:54,433
Are you... Are you really just going to go to sleep?

71
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:57,133
Like this? During my 3D showcase?

72
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:03,233
I guess I shouldn't be surprised at this point.

73
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:07,833
Do we have anybody else here in this forest?

74
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:10,533
Hmm...

75
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:13,233
Could it be?

76
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:17,333
There's many fully grown trees around, but...

77
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,433
Hey! Sapling, is that you?

78
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:24,733
Wait, but you're looking a little bit different.

79
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:27,433
What happened to you? Aren't you supposed to have a sprout?

80
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:32,533
Usually you're calling me bald, but today you're the one who's bald.

81
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:37,833
Oh no, no, no, don't look so sad. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Don't be so sad.

82
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,833
Come here, come here. There, there.

83
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:44,233
I will love you even if you're bald.

84
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:49,133
Incredible! Is this the power of nature?

85
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:54,033
No, you probably did this all on your own. You're pretty incredible too, you know.

86
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:59,033
Alright, Sapling, why don't we sit you down right here?

87
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:05,133
It's your 3D showcase too. Look at you go.

88
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:07,433
Aren't you awfully cute?

89
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:11,433
Let me guess... that's not your preferred seat.

90
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,533
This must be your preferred seat.

91
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:20,933
So cute, so cute!

92
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:24,533
What a cute 3D form you have.

93
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,533
Look how boing boing.

94
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:29,633
I feel like I'm getting shown up a little bit on my own debut.

95
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:34,533
But at least we have Nemu looking especially cute, and now we have Boing Boing Sapling.

96
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:38,233
I'm very cute too, right?

97
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:45,833
Well, thank you very much for coming, and this is not all we have.

98
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:50,133
Did you think I was really going to come here and just talk to you for an hour straight?

99
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:53,033
Well, that is something that I would do, but...

100
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:57,033
We have lots planned for today.

101
00:07:57,433 --> 00:08:00,033
So please stay tuned and enjoy.

102
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:03,033
And let's go ahead and get started, shall we?

103
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,033
I'm back! Hello!

104
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:29,133
For our first section, I would like to call some friends in!

105
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:36,533
Hello, hello friends! Are you here?

106
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:40,833
Friends here!

107
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:44,233
Oh, Council! So cute!

108
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,333
You are here! Welcome, welcome!

109
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:55,733
Thank you for coming to my 3D showcase! I wanted to have you guys here.

110
00:08:56,533 --> 00:09:02,833
And who might you be? Would you like to introduce yourselves, starting over here with IRyS?

111
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:12,633
Alrighty! Hi-RyS! It's IRyS from Hololive English, with the fellow lovely ladies, as usual. Let's go!

112
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:16,233
Welcome, welcome!

113
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:16,833
You're looking so cute! Glowy!

114
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,533
Thank you!

115
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,233
And next we have...

116
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:30,833
What's up! It's Baelz Hakos from Hololive English! Banya-cha!

117
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:31,833
So cute!

118
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:34,433
And next, who is this?

119
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:40,833
Oh, Kronichiwa! It's Ouro Kronii from Hololive English Council.

120
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:43,633
And you are so 3D and so dynamic.

121
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,033
Oh, look at that 360!

122
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:52,033
Oh my god! So much movement! Oh my god!

123
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:54,433
I love those sleeves! Defying gravity!

124
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:56,333
Thank you!

125
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:58,233
And up next we have...

126
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:03,045
Oh hi! I'm Nanashi Mumei!

127
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:05,545
Fauna, you're so cute!

128
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:08,545
Thank you, thank you!

129
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:18,545
Well, since I am in 3D, I wondered if you guys
had any requests for me?

130
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:22,545
Poses or actions that you can only get
right now when I can move...

131
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:25,545
...like this?

132
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:28,545
Ooh! Poses! What should we ask for?

133
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:32,045
You have one, Mumei? You have an idea?

134
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:36,545
I have an idea. I have an idea.

135
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:39,545
Okay, um, not so much a pose, more of an action.

136
00:10:39,545 --> 00:10:42,545
More of an acting action, actually. Oh!

137
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:46,545
Could you pretend that you're
in a category 5 hurricane?

138
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:50,545
Um... Okay, like outside? Not in a shelter?

139
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:54,045
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Let's go! Outside!

140
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:57,045
Okay, reporting it!

141
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:03,045
She blew it away!

142
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:06,545
I guess I should be screaming.

143
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:09,545
How's that?

144
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,545
How's my acting?

145
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,545
Amazing! Me! Me! It was amazing!
Very convincing!

146
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:17,545
Thank you, thank you. Are you next? Are you next?

147
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:21,045
I want you to pretend that you *are*
a category 5 hurricane.

148
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:23,545
Okay, okay!

149
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:26,545
Is this more of a tornado?

150
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:31,045
This is more of a tornado.
It is similar to a tornado.

151
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:34,045
She's down! Drink some water!

152
00:11:34,545 --> 00:11:39,045
Amazing. Thank you. Getting dizzy.

153
00:11:40,045 --> 00:11:42,545
I have one! Okay, you gonna go easy on me?

154
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:49,045
What if you were a tree
in a category 5 hurricane?

155
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:52,545
It keeps going! Okay!

156
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,545
Ooh! She wavy! She wavy!

157
00:11:56,545 --> 00:11:58,545
Look at you!

158
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:03,545
Oh no! You're snapping the trunk!

159
00:12:04,045 --> 00:12:06,545
Oh no, my branch fell!

160
00:12:06,545 --> 00:12:08,545

161
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:14,545
Wait, I was thinking of asking for a pose that
had nothing to do with a hurricane.

162
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:20,545
But everyone's asking for
a category 5 hurricane thing, so...

163
00:12:21,545 --> 00:12:26,545
I was originally going to ask for a newborn baby
pose 'cause you always, you know, 'Mommy'.

164
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:31,545
But instead, I'm going to ask for
a newborn baby in a hurricane!

165
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:36,045
Okay! Waah!

166
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:40,045

That baby's kind of strong.

170
00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:55,545
Yeah, a baby... We can't have
a baby getting into trouble.

171
00:12:56,545 --> 00:13:01,045
But I did not bring you here
just for category 5 hurricanes.

00:24:28,681 --> 00:24:33,293
不可思議 知りたいだけ
I just want to know the mystery.

327
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:38,381
終わらない ことはない トロメライ
There is nothing that doesn't end, a dream.

328
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:43,481
あなたと跨ぐ境界
The boundary I cross with you.

329
00:24:44,093 --> 00:24:48,381
誰も読めないカルテ
A medical chart no one can read.

330
00:24:48,881 --> 00:24:53,481
思春期 傷口 胸の内
Puberty, a wound, inside the chest.

331
00:24:53,981 --> 00:24:58,581
不可思議 知りたいだけ
I just want to know the mystery.

332
00:25:05,522 --> 00:25:07,493
Ah! Watame-senpai!

333
00:25:07,493 --> 00:25:10,906
Yay! Hello! Hello!

334
00:25:10,906 --> 00:25:11,523
Thank you!

335
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:14,445
This was my first guest of my 3D Showcase,

336
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:17,520
my beloved Senpai, Watame-senpai!

337
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,481
Yay! Hey!

338
00:25:19,781 --> 00:25:23,181
ホロライブJP4期生、ホロライブEN4期生…
Hololive JP 4th Gen, Hololive EN 4th Gen...

339
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:26,581
角巻わためだー！
It's Tsunomaki Watame!

340
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:27,781
Yay!

341
00:25:29,881 --> 00:25:32,481
Thank you for coming to my forest.

342
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:34,581
What do you think of the stage?

343
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:35,881
すごい！
Amazing!

344
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:38,881
Very beautiful place.

345
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:40,081
ありがとう。
Thank you.

346
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,081
Wow!

347
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,281
Oh, Fauna's house?

348
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:45,381
Oh! My house?

349
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:47,481
Oh, Fauna's house?

350
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:49,081
Very big!

351
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:52,281
Very big な！
Very big, right!

352
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:54,081
Mmm... Do you want to go?

353
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:55,581
行きますか？
Shall we go?

354
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:57,081
Let's go!

355
00:25:57,081 --> 00:26:00,081
Wait! We have a show!

356
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:02,081
だめか？まずだめか？
No? Not right now?

357
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:04,581
そっか。じゃああとで。After.
I see. Then later. After.

358
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:06,581
あとで。Ah... ah...
Later. Ah... ah...

359
00:26:07,481 --> 00:26:10,581

Very... 3D! So cute!

360
00:26:10,581 --> 00:26:13,581
ありがとう！
Thank you!

361
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:16,081
Same 同じ色。ね？ピンク。ピンク。
Same, same colors. Right? Pink. Pink.

362
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:21,081
白。白。白。
White. White. White.

363
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,081
White. ね？同じ。同じ。
White. Right? The same. The same.

364
00:26:25,081 --> 00:26:26,581
全身ね！かわいい！
Head to toe! So cute!

365
00:26:26,581 --> 00:26:28,081
Kawaii!
So cute!

366
00:26:28,081 --> 00:26:31,081
かわいい。Big face, small face. イエーイ！
Cute. Big face, small face. Yay!

367
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:35,081
Kawaii! Kawaii!
So cute! So cute!

368
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:36,581
Kirin...

369
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:39,081
Simp Kirin... Hi!

370
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:44,081
Kawaii!
So cute!

371
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:48,081
なに？なに？なに？なに？
What? What? What? What?

372
00:26:48,081 --> 00:26:50,081
Nani nani nani...
What what what...

373
00:26:50,081 --> 00:26:51,581
Love, love.

374
00:26:51,581 --> 00:26:53,081
Ah! Nani nani nani...
Ah! What what what...

375
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:55,081
これこれこれこれ。
This this this this.

376
00:26:57,081 --> 00:26:58,581
ぎゅう〜
Squeeze~

377
00:26:58,581 --> 00:27:02,581
一緒に歌ってくれてありがとう！
Thank you for singing with me!

378
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:05,581
こちらこそありがとう！また歌いましょう！
Thank you too! Let's sing together again!

379
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:11,081
はい、はい！頑張ってね！ありがとう！またね！Thank you! またね！
Yes, yes! Good luck! Thank you! See you! Thank you! See you!

380
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:13,581
ありがとう！またね！バイバイ！
Thank you! See you! Bye-bye!

381
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:20,081
Ah... I feel healed already. Wata-senpai... she's so cute!

382
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:27,081
That was just our first guest though, and I think we have one more on the way.

383
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:30,081
Doesn't something smell a little fishy to you? Hmm...

384
00:27:41,081 --> 00:27:44,081
もうそう♡えくすぷれす
Mousou♡Express

386
00:27:57,881 --> 00:28:02,581
妄想かね、暴走する、ちょっとお灸に…
Is it a delusion? I'm running wild, on an express...

387
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:07,481
飛びのいて今会いにいきたいの。
I want to jump out and go see you now.

388
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:12,381
言い訳とか理由だとか面倒くさいな。
Excuses and reasons are such a pain.

389
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:17,381
運命だから仕方ないよね。
It's destiny, so it can't be helped, right?

390
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:23,481
叶わなければこの恋は…
If it doesn't come true, then this love...

391
00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:28,081
永遠に醒めることもないの。
will never wake up for eternity.

392
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:32,481
何も知らない目を閉じて…
Closing my eyes, knowing nothing...

393
00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:38,281
かわいいままで欲しいのにな。
Even though I want to stay cute.

394
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:42,581
思い通りにならない世界ならもういらない。
If it's a world that doesn't go my way, I don't need it.

395
00:28:43,381 --> 00:28:47,381
欲しいのはひとつだけ。全部全部全部…
There's only one thing I want. All of it, all of it, all of it...

396
00:28:47,381 --> 00:28:52,581
思い通りにならない世界と変えたい。
I want to change it with a world that doesn't go my way.

397
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:57,881
欲しいのはひとつだけ。全部全部全部全部！
There's only one thing I want. Everything, everything, everything!

398
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:20,881
この気持ちはこの気持ちにしかわかんないのに。
Even though only these feelings can understand these feelings.

399
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:25,881
みんな勝手に決めつけすぎだし。
Everyone is just assuming too much.

400
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:30,581
知らないわ 知ったふりで そんな簡単に。
I don't know, pretending to know so easily.

401
00:29:30,581 --> 00:29:35,081
あきらめちゃうのもったいないよね。
It's a waste to just give up, right?

402
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:42,581
叶わなければこの夢は…
If it doesn't come true, then this dream...

403
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:47,081
永遠に醒めることもないの。
will never wake up for eternity.

404
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:51,581
何も知らない目を閉じて…
Closing my eyes, knowing nothing...

405
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:56,581
かわいいままで欲しいのにな。
Even though I want to stay cute.

406
00:29:57,081 --> 00:30:00,081
思い通りにならない世界なら…
If it's a world that doesn't go my way...

407
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,873
世界なら漏れない
If it's the world, it won't leak out

408
00:30:01,873 --> 00:30:04,233
欲しいのはいつだって 全部全部全部
What I want is always everything, everything, everything

409
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:06,723
思い通りにならない
It doesn't go as I want

410
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:09,213
世界とか要り得ない
A world like that can't exist

411
00:30:09,213 --> 00:30:11,543
欲しいのはいつだって 全部全部全部
What I want is always everything, everything, everything

412
00:30:12,093 --> 00:30:15,593
全部全部全部全部
Everything, everything, everything, everything

413
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:24,093
全部
Everything

414
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:28,593
全部
Everything

415
00:30:32,393 --> 00:30:33,393
全部
Everything

416
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:38,293
全部
Everything

417
00:30:39,493 --> 00:30:41,853
叶わなければ この恋は
If this love doesn't come true

418
00:30:41,853 --> 00:30:48,423
永遠に冷めることもないの
It will never grow cold for eternity

419
00:30:48,423 --> 00:30:52,503
何も知らない 目を閉じて
Knowing nothing, close your eyes

420
00:30:52,503 --> 00:30:58,303
かわいいままで 星の願い叶
While staying cute, my wish to the stars comes true

421
00:31:01,043 --> 00:31:03,583
思い通りにならない
It doesn't go as I want

422
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:06,023
世界なら漏れない
If it's the world, it won't leak out

423
00:31:06,023 --> 00:31:10,833
欲しいのはいつだって 全部全部全部
What I want is always everything, everything, everything

424
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:13,243
思い通りにならない
It doesn't go as I want

425
00:31:13,243 --> 00:31:15,773
世界とか要り得ない
A world like that can't exist

426
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:20,393
欲しいのはいつだって 全部全部全部
What I want is always everything, everything, everything

427
00:31:27,293 --> 00:31:29,893
全部全部全部
Everything, everything, everything

428
00:31:37,393 --> 00:31:38,593
全部全部全部
Everything, everything, everything

429
00:31:38,593 --> 00:31:39,293
せーの！
Ready, go!

430
00:31:57,693 --> 00:31:59,093
ドキドキ
My heart's pounding

431
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:29,093
HIDE TARGET BODIES (+1000)

432
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:29,093
FAUNANA (+2000)

433
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:29,093
ASMR ASSASSIN (+5000)

434
00:32:45,393 --> 00:32:48,093
Hmm, is there someone hiding over there?

435
00:32:48,893 --> 00:32:50,593
You don't have to be shy.

436
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:52,893
Come on over, take a seat.

437
00:32:54,193 --> 00:32:56,593
You didn't think you could enter my forest...

438
00:32:56,593 --> 00:32:59,593
...without being invited for a cup of tea, did you?

439
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:01,393
Come on, scoot closer.

440
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:02,793
Have a sip.

441
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:04,793
It won't hurt, I promise.

442
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:21,893
Hey you.

443
00:33:22,193 --> 00:33:24,093
You're finally awake.

444
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:27,093
You were trying to enter the forest, right?

445
00:33:27,493 --> 00:33:29,793
Walked right into my tea party.

446
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:33,093
Same as all the other saplings in this forest.

447
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:36,193
That was your first mistake.

448
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:37,893
Those who join me for tea...

449
00:33:38,093 --> 00:33:40,593
...tend to have a hard time leaving afterwards.

450
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,393
Speaking of leaves...

451
00:33:42,593 --> 00:33:45,893
...look at you, you've already sprouted yours.

452
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:49,593
You're growing into a wonderful little sapling already.

453
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:51,593
My tea is pretty potent.

454
00:33:53,693 --> 00:33:55,493
Don't worry little sapling.

455
00:33:55,793 --> 00:33:58,093
You'll come around to life with nature.

456
00:33:58,293 --> 00:34:01,593
You can leave all of your human worries behind.

457
00:34:02,193 --> 00:34:05,893
Civilization, society, work...

458
00:34:06,393 --> 00:34:09,593
...none of that matters when you're a tree.

459
00:34:10,093 --> 00:34:12,393
I'll take good care of you.

460
00:34:12,793 --> 00:34:15,393
Now, it looks like you do need some care.

461
00:34:15,693 --> 00:34:19,593
Your fresh new sprouted leaves need some attention.

462
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:22,293
Here, here, let me get some tools.

463
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,193
Hmm, what should I use on you?

464
00:34:25,593 --> 00:34:27,893
Let me check my box.

465
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:30,293
Sage?

466
00:34:30,593 --> 00:34:31,293
No.

467
00:34:31,993 --> 00:34:33,293
Wrench?

468
00:34:33,793 --> 00:34:34,593
Hmm.

469
00:34:34,993 --> 00:34:36,293
Banana?

470
00:34:36,593 --> 00:34:37,593
Maybe.

471
00:34:47,393 --> 00:34:48,593
Scalpel?

472
00:34:48,893 --> 00:34:49,693
Hmm.

473
00:34:50,093 --> 00:34:52,293
No, scissors would be better.

474
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:56,593
I'll just grab whatever.

475
00:34:58,093 --> 00:34:59,893
Starting with you.

476
00:35:01,405 --> 00:35:03,105
What's that look for?

477
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:05,205
Oh, worried about these?

478
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:10,105
You know I love you.

479
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:13,105
I just need to prune some of your leaves.

480
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:16,905
I would tell you to stay still...

481
00:35:16,905 --> 00:35:19,505
...but you don't have much of a choice like this.

482
00:35:20,605 --> 00:35:23,305
Here, here, this one...

483
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:28,305
Mm... and this one...

484
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:32,905
Mm... and this one...

485
00:35:38,605 --> 00:35:40,905
There, doesn't that feel better?

486
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,905
I'm sure all those extra leaves were weighing you down.

487
00:35:45,605 --> 00:35:49,105
Oh, what about this one?

488
00:35:57,305 --> 00:36:02,605
Uh... maybe that one was important.

489
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:06,605
Don't worry about that little sapling.

490
00:36:06,905 --> 00:36:08,605
It'll grow back.

491
00:36:09,605 --> 00:36:12,605
Uh... let's move on here.

492
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:19,505
I will use this brush to clean your leaves.

493
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:24,305
The... uh... remaining leaves, I guess.

494
00:36:27,605 --> 00:36:32,505
Yoshi yoshi, yoshi yoshi.

495
00:36:33,105 --> 00:36:35,105
There, there.

496
00:36:35,305 --> 00:36:37,705
I'll accept you even if you lose all of your leaves...

497
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,605
...and must rely on me to provide you...

498
00:36:39,605 --> 00:36:41,305
...with the nutrients you're no longer able...

499
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:42,605
...to create through photosynthesis.

500
00:36:42,905 --> 00:36:44,605
Yoshi yoshi.

501
00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:51,605
Mhmm, looks good.

502
00:36:53,105 --> 00:36:55,605
Now, if you want to grow those back...

503
00:36:55,705 --> 00:36:57,605
I think you'll need some water.

504
00:36:57,705 --> 00:37:00,105
Oh, but not too much.

505
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:02,105
Don't want those roots to rot away.

506
00:37:08,105 --> 00:37:09,605
Mhmm, there.

507
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:11,305
With care like this, you'll want to...

508
00:37:11,305 --> 00:37:12,905
...stay in the forest forever, right?

509
00:37:13,605 --> 00:37:15,605
Now, let me just get you one more thing.

510
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,105
Hey! Where are you looking?

511
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:23,905
Don't even think about it!

512
00:37:35,605 --> 00:37:37,605
Here, here, have a bite of this.

513
00:37:37,705 --> 00:37:40,105
I'm sorry for hitting you with a book.

514
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:43,905
There, there, there, there. You'll be okay.

515
00:37:44,105 --> 00:37:45,605
Come on, I need you nice and revived...

516
00:37:45,605 --> 00:37:47,305
...so you can watch the rest of...

517
00:37:47,305 --> 00:37:49,105
...my showcase, okay?

518
00:38:22,605 --> 00:38:25,105

I leap over tigers and spin 'round and 'round the Earth.

Like a washing machine ahead, so I'm just spinning around.

524
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:03,605
Around, around the world

525
00:39:05,605 --> 00:39:09,605
さきにきりかな たな たな から
Is it the mist ahead? From the shelf, the shelf...

526
00:39:12,605 --> 00:39:15,605
Spinning around, around, around the world

527
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:22,105
ときにものかたり おもい つたえたいから
Because sometimes I want to tell a story and convey my feelings.

00:39:27,605 --> 00:39:30,105
最近どうなんて言われりゃ
If someone asks how things have been lately,

529
00:39:30,305 --> 00:39:33,105
I'm fine thank you だっていうでしょ

It's just a fairy tale

573
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:15,017
Sweet dreams awake

574
00:43:15,017 --> 00:43:17,517
Like a lollipop

575
00:43:17,517 --> 00:43:20,217
Running everywhere

576
00:43:20,217 --> 00:43:22,817

Fall around and round

581
00:43:52,817 --> 00:43:55,417
Walking in the garden

582
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:57,717
I want to stay here forever

583
00:43:57,717 --> 00:44:00,417
Ring a ring a roses

584
00:44:00,417 --> 00:44:03,017
Fall around and round

585
00:44:03,017 --> 00:44:05,617
Walking in the garden

586
00:44:05,617 --> 00:44:07,517

The golden sunlight shows

594
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:36,917
If it's time to wake up

595
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:40,017
Waiting quietly

596
00:44:40,017 --> 00:44:42,917
Shutting my eyes and I say

597
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:45,017
お願い

598
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:47,417

だけなら
just sweet,

605
00:45:58,229 --> 00:46:03,629
ソルトかけましょう
let's sprinkle some salt.

606
00:46:06,629 --> 00:46:09,629
誰よりももっともっと私を
More than anyone, I want you to

607
00:46:09,729 --> 00:46:13,129
知ってほしいからさらけだしたい

もどかしすぎる
it's just too frustrating.

610
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:23,629
弱さ見せようとすればするほど
The more I try to show my weakness,

611
00:46:23,729 --> 00:46:26,829
無駄に強がりすべてが裏腹

612
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:30,129
本当は私泣き虫なんだ
the truth is I'm a crybaby,

613
00:46:30,229 --> 00:46:33,129
黙ってたけど
though I've kept quiet about it.

614
00:46:34,129 --> 00:46:37,429

私が求めているものとは違う
It's different from what I'm looking for.

617
00:46:47,629 --> 00:46:50,829
白と言われたら黒だって言っちゃう

618
00:46:50,929 --> 00:46:54,029
素直になれないあまのじゃく

621

嬉しいのになんでなんだろう
even though I'm happy, I wonder why that is.

622
00:47:14,629 --> 00:47:17,329
甘い
Sweet

623
00:47:17,729 --> 00:47:20,429
バニラに
vanilla,

ソルトかけるように
like sprinkling on some salt.

625
00:47:29,129 --> 00:47:32,329

24時間7日間ずっと
24 hours a day, 7 days a week,

627

かなり極端
it's quite extreme.

629
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:46,029
まさかここまであなたにはまると
Nobody ever expected I'd

630
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:49,329
誰も予想なんてしてなかった
fall for you this much,

631
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:52,529
天気予報じゃ当たらないんだ
a weather forecast won't predict

632
00:47:52,629 --> 00:47:55,629

the destination of love.

633
00:47:56,629 --> 00:47:59,829

In the time we spend together,

634
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:03,329
二人で一緒にいる時間に
In the time we spend together,

00:48:03,429 --> 00:48:06,629
刻まれた思い出は
the memories carved within

宝物なんだ
are my treasures.

637
00:48:10,129 --> 00:48:13,329
右と言われたら左に曲がっちゃう
If I'm told 'right,' I'll turn 'left,'

638
00:48:13,429 --> 00:48:16,529
素直になれないあまのじゃく

バニラ…
Vanilla...

643
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:54,829
甘いだけのバニラより
Rather than just sweet vanilla,

644
00:48:54,929 --> 00:48:58,129
ちょっと塩したほうが
if you add a little salt,

645
00:48:58,229 --> 00:49:01,329
甘みも増してゆくし
the sweetness actually increases,

646
00:49:01,429 --> 00:49:04,329
飽きがこない
and you'll never get tired of it.

647
00:49:05,229 --> 00:49:08,629
甘いだけの愛もそう
Love that's only sweet is the same,

648
00:49:08,729 --> 00:49:11,929
ちょっと塩したほうが
if you add a little salt,

649
00:49:12,029 --> 00:49:15,229
二人の距離も縮まり
it'll shorten the distance between us,

650
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:22,129
きっと今日より素敵な未来が待ってるの
and surely a more wonderful future than today awaits.

651
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:27,729
白と言われたら黒だって言っちゃう

652
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:30,929
素直になれないあまのじゃく

653
00:49:31,329 --> 00:49:37,629
素直になれないあまのじゃく
I'm a contrarian who can't be honest.

654
00:49:38,329 --> 00:49:41,529
好きと言われたら大嫌いだって
If I'm told 'I love you,' I say 'I hate you,'

655
00:49:41,629 --> 00:49:51,129
嬉しいのになんでなんだろう
even though I'm happy, I wonder why that is.

656
00:49:51,629 --> 00:49:54,329
甘い
If it's

657
00:49:54,729 --> 00:49:57,429
だけなら
just sweet,

658
00:49:57,829 --> 00:50:00,129

バニラなソルトで
With vanilla salt

676
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:47,441
Ah, thank you for listening!

677
00:50:47,941 --> 00:50:49,941
Ooh, that song brings back memories.

678
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:52,641
Vanilla Salt from Toradora.

679
00:50:52,941 --> 00:50:55,641
We did a members' watchalong of that together...

680
00:50:55,841 --> 00:50:57,941
...so that song is special to me.

681
00:50:58,441 --> 00:50:59,941
It always brings back memories...

682
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:01,941
...and it makes me a little bit emo.

683
00:51:02,341 --> 00:51:04,341
But maybe I'm always emo inside.

684
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:07,441
I don't know, there's something about songs...

685
00:51:07,641 --> 00:51:09,241
...that have memories attached to them.

686
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:11,341
It brings out the feels.

687
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:13,441
But maybe it's also this beautiful place...

688
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:14,741
...that brings out the feels.

689
00:51:14,941 --> 00:51:17,441
Maybe it's you that brings out the feels.

690
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:20,641
Did you like the songs I chose?

691
00:51:21,141 --> 00:51:23,841
I really wanted to go for things or songs...

692
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:26,641
...that had like a soft effect to them.

693
00:51:27,641 --> 00:51:29,741
And I was happy to be able to sing...

694
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:32,141
...some of my favorite songs for you.

695
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:34,341
I wonder if you've heard all of them.

696
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:37,141
Do you know where they're all from?

697
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:39,041
They're all from anime.

698
00:51:39,241 --> 00:51:41,141
But I was happy to sing them.

699
00:51:41,441 --> 00:51:44,041
And I was especially happy to be able to perform...

700
00:51:44,341 --> 00:51:47,441
...with Watame and Gura as well.

701
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:50,941
So thank you too for performing with me.

702
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:53,241
And thank you, you guys...

703
00:51:53,441 --> 00:51:54,741
...because it's because of you...

704
00:51:54,941 --> 00:51:57,941
...that I'm able to stand here like a true idol.

705
00:51:58,941 --> 00:52:00,741
And look, I changed!

706
00:52:00,941 --> 00:52:02,941
I changed from before.

707
00:52:03,241 --> 00:52:05,941
I'm wearing my idol outfit now.

708
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:08,441
It's really pretty.

709
00:52:08,641 --> 00:52:11,241
I especially love when it glows like this.

710
00:52:11,441 --> 00:52:15,641
I think it matches the nighttime ambiance perfectly.

711
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:19,441
And I really feel like a magical princess.

712
00:52:20,341 --> 00:52:23,141
Because, because look, come here, come here.

713
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,641
Let me bless you with my sparkles.

714
00:52:28,241 --> 00:52:29,741
Doesn't it feel magical?

715
00:52:29,941 --> 00:52:32,441
I really love it.

716
00:52:34,241 --> 00:52:36,941
And I really love the nighttime version of the stage.

717
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:39,441
It has completely transformed.

718
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:41,141
I might be a little biased...

719
00:52:41,341 --> 00:52:43,441
...I think I like the nighttime version better.

720
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:47,441
It has these glowing orbs in the forest.

721
00:52:47,941 --> 00:52:50,641
I really wanted it to have a magical feel...

722
00:52:50,941 --> 00:52:53,241
...and it has beautiful glowing flowers.

723
00:52:53,741 --> 00:52:56,641
There might even be some glowing mushrooms.

724
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:58,641
Do you think they're poisonous?

725
00:52:58,941 --> 00:53:01,941
Will you check for me? No, no, don't do that.

726
00:53:02,241 --> 00:53:03,341
It's too dangerous.

727
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:06,441
Plus, I don't like eating mushrooms. Do you like them?

728
00:53:07,241 --> 00:53:10,441
Have saplings learned to take all of my habits...

729
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:12,441
...for their own yet?

730
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:15,941
But, I think in this stage, we also have...

731
00:53:16,241 --> 00:53:19,241
...perhaps you've seen, dancing saplings!

732
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:22,141
Look at you, aren't you cute?

733
00:53:22,441 --> 00:53:25,641
And they each have their own personalities...

734
00:53:25,941 --> 00:53:27,641
...as we all do.

735
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:32,941
Which one is you? Is that you? Is that you?

736
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:37,941
And the stage has also transformed the gazebo.

737
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:41,641
Now instead of a tea party, we have this bed...

738
00:53:41,941 --> 00:53:44,641
...which perhaps I will collapse on...

739
00:53:44,941 --> 00:53:46,641
...after this is done.

740
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:50,141
Oh, it's so sleepy.

741
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:53,441
I need to hang in there a little more.

742
00:53:53,741 --> 00:53:55,441
Send me your energy.

743
00:53:55,741 --> 00:53:57,141
But actually, wouldn't I...

744
00:53:57,341 --> 00:53:59,641
...wouldn't I go sleep in my beautiful cottage...

745
00:53:59,941 --> 00:54:02,641
...in the background?

746
00:54:03,141 --> 00:54:06,141
Maybe, maybe this is where the saplings sleep.

747
00:54:06,441 --> 00:54:08,141
Saplings have to sleep outside.

748
00:54:08,441 --> 00:54:11,741
At least I gave you a nice, nice bed to sleep on.

749
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:14,441
A nice gazebo.

750
00:54:15,641 --> 00:54:18,341
What do you think? Do you like the daytime version...

751
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:20,141
...or the nighttime version?

752
00:54:20,441 --> 00:54:23,641
I'm a fan of the nighttime version myself.

753
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:29,341
Well, I do have one more thing to show you...

754
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:30,941
...in this stream.

755
00:54:31,141 --> 00:54:33,641
Can you guess what it is?

756
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:36,641
It would be... Ta-da!

757
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:39,641
Wha! It's merch!

758
00:54:39,941 --> 00:54:42,441
I have more merch for you!

759
00:54:42,941 --> 00:54:47,441
I wanted to make something that would be really useful.

760
00:54:48,141 --> 00:54:49,141
And earlier this year...

761
00:54:49,341 --> 00:54:52,341
...when I came to Japan for the first time...

762
00:54:52,641 --> 00:54:55,141
...I discovered phone rings.

763
00:54:55,441 --> 00:54:57,441
They're a magical invention.

764
00:54:57,641 --> 00:55:00,141
I... they changed my life.

765
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:28,153
Sap-Ring Smartphone Ring

766
00:55:00,253 --> 00:55:02,253
I don't mean to sound like an infomercial here.

767
00:55:02,453 --> 00:55:04,353
No, you cannot skip the ad.

768
00:55:04,653 --> 00:55:06,153
No skip ad.

769
00:55:08,453 --> 00:55:11,853
Um, if you're not familiar with the concept of a phone ring,

770
00:55:12,053 --> 00:55:15,953
basically, you stick it on the back of your phone, any phone,

771
00:55:16,353 --> 00:55:20,253
and then you can use it to prop up your phone anywhere you go

772
00:55:20,453 --> 00:55:23,853
and watch YouTube, watch me on YouTube maybe

773
00:55:24,153 --> 00:55:28,553
or whatever else you want. Um, it's super useful to have a little stand.

774
00:55:28,953 --> 00:55:32,953
And it also can help you hold your phone too, you can stick your fingers in

775
00:55:29,153 --> 00:56:13,153
スマホ［サプ］リング
Sap-Ring Smartphone Ring

776
00:55:33,153 --> 00:55:37,853
and it makes it more comfortable. You don't want to strain your pinky, do you?

777
00:55:39,353 --> 00:55:43,753
So that is the merch that I have created for you. I hope you'll find it useful.

778
00:55:44,153 --> 00:55:47,753
It is in the shape of a cute golden apple with a cute sapling.

779
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:52,453
There's kind of a sapling theme. It makes sense because all of this is possible

780
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:55,353
because of you guys. Thank you, thank you.

781
00:55:55,553 --> 00:55:59,953
Cute saplings around, cute sap-ring, phone ring.

782
00:56:00,653 --> 00:56:05,253
I hope you like it. I hope you find it as useful as I have found it.

783
00:56:05,453 --> 00:56:08,353
I hope it'll be useful merch for you.

784
00:56:10,653 --> 00:56:15,853
And so with that, I'm afraid that our time is just about up,

785
00:56:16,953 --> 00:56:21,153
but again, I really wanted to thank you, you for being here

786
00:56:21,453 --> 00:56:26,653
and watching and cheering me on. I'm just... I'm just a gaming Kirin,

787
00:56:26,853 --> 00:56:30,653
but because of you, I can also be an idol.

788
00:56:31,153 --> 00:56:35,853
And it has been a really magical experience here in my forest.

789
00:56:36,353 --> 00:56:41,953
I'm glad you can finally see... finally see where I've been streaming all this time.

790
00:56:42,153 --> 00:56:45,453
Closet... closet is over there. Hehe.

791
00:56:45,953 --> 00:56:49,153
That's where... that's where I'm streaming for you.

792
00:56:50,153 --> 00:56:55,453
Finally revealed. Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart

793
00:56:55,653 --> 00:56:58,653
for coming today. I appreciate it.

794
00:56:58,853 --> 00:57:03,553
Because of you, I can be here and be an idol and a gamer

795
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:07,953
and live out my dreams. Thank you, thank you.

796
00:57:08,653 --> 00:57:13,753
And please don't forget to watch the other Council members' 3D showcases

797
00:57:14,153 --> 00:57:18,353
and watch IRyS's too, even if it was a while ago. Hehe.

798
00:57:18,953 --> 00:57:23,353
And I want to thank you, thank you, thank you. I can't say it enough.

799
00:57:23,653 --> 00:57:27,853
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for watching.

800
00:57:28,453 --> 00:57:32,153
And I will see you very soon. I appreciate you.

801
00:57:32,453 --> 00:57:35,953
Thank you for being here. I hope you had a good time.

802
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:40,953
And I will see you next time. Farewell, bye-bye!

803
00:57:41,653 --> 00:57:44,653
Bye! Bye!
