2
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
私の色はあなたに見つけてもらえますか？
Can you find my color for me?

3
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,500
born to be real

4
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,310
どこまでも言えてたら
If only I could say everything

5
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,652
どこまでも笑えてたら
If only I could laugh all the way

6
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:08,513
見事も無くしたんだ
I've lost everything completely

7
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:11,025
自分に嘘ついて
Lying to myself

8
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:13,250
背伸びした一人前で
Pretending to be a grown-up

9
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:15,820
なりふり構わずなんて
Without caring about appearances

10
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:18,350
スカした表情に白けて
Wearied by a pretentious face

11
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,650
何を守れるの？
What can I protect?

12
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:31,850
永遠に愛したって
Even if I love you forever

13
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,215
期待したって違うでしょ
Even if I expect it, it's different, right?

14
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:38,850
見ていたい 誰にとっての天使だろ
I want to see whose angel I am

15
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:41,135
何も言わないで
Don't say anything

16
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,225
腐らないで 止まらないから
Don't rot, because I won't stop

17
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,030
渦巻く人にわき目も
Without even a glance at the swirling crowd

18
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:51,355
この声が届くはず
This voice should reach you

19
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,000
born to be real

20
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,850
生きていたい
I want to live

21
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,633
たったいま投げられた言葉
The words that were just thrown

22
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:09,533
その意味を壊すかもしれないなんて
To think they might break that meaning

23
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,733
たんねえな　言えばいい1人前で
It's not enough, just say it as a full-grown adult

24
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:15,833
手を振るか試すつもりで
Intending to test if I'll wave back

25
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:20,533
この正義の反対は別の正義じゃないんだ
The opposite of this justice isn't another justice

26
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,533
Every answer

27
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:26,533
わからないんだ
I don't know

28
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,533
誰か教えて
Someone tell me

29
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,833
永遠に愛したって期待したって違うでしょ
Even if I love forever, even if I expect, it's different, right?

30
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:38,233
一体何を以てこの答えだろ
Just what leads to this answer?

31
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:43,033
何も言えないよ　わかんないよ　だから歌うんだ
I can't say anything, I don't know, so I'll sing

32
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:47,333
胸が邪魔して君のために
My heart gets in the way, for you

33
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:51,533
この声が枯れるまで
Until this voice withers

34
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:54,033
唇は...
My lips...

35
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:03,833
生まれた理由なんて意味なんて
The reason for being born, the meaning

36
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,033
君のあとづけままで
Leaving them as your afterthoughts

37
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:12,033
だけど出会えたそれが全てなんだ
But having met you, that's everything

38
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:15,533
例え泣いたって笑ったって変わんない未来
Whether I cry or laugh, the future won't change

39
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:19,533
自分に今日も嘘ついて
Lying to myself again today

40
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:23,533
何をどうしたって腐ったって
No matter what I do, even if I rot

41
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:26,833
どうせ同じなら
If it's the same anyway

42
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:30,033
嘘つきはやめたんだ
I've stopped being a liar

43
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:34,033
永遠に愛したって期待したって違うでしょ
Even if I love forever, even if I expect, it's different, right?

44
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:38,233
一体誰を以てこの答えだろ
Just who leads to this answer?

45
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:43,533
何も言わないで腐らないで　もう止まらないから
Don't say anything, don't rot, because I won't stop anymore

46
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:47,333
大切な人にはきっと
To the precious person, surely

47
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:51,533
この声が届くはず
This voice should reach

48
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:54,033
唇は...
My lips...

49
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:57,033
born to be real

50
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:00,033
born to be real

51
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:16,833
イエーイ！ということでみなさん、こんやっぴー！ホロライブ4期生、常闇トワ様です！
Yay! So everyone, konyappii! I'm Hololive 4th Gen, Tokoyami Towa-sama!

52
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:22,533
はい、ということで、この広いステージに今トワ1人。そして先ほど歌ったのは…
Yes, so, Towa's all alone on this wide stage. And what I just sang was...

53
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:29,033
3rdフェスぶりだね、born to be real、トワのオリジナル曲になります。
Since the 3rd Fes, "born to be real," it's my original song.

54
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:30,533
どうだったかな？
How was it?

55
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:37,033
ちょっと3rdフェスとはね、若干、若干違う振りにはなってましたけれども、何でかって言うと…
The choreo was slightly, slightly different from the 3rd Fes, but as for why...

56
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:39,033
日が空いているから！
Because some time has passed!

57
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:44,233
そう、まあそんなことは気にしない気にしない。
Right, well, don't worry about that, don't worry.

58
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:51,533
でも、このすいちゃんが好きなね、この振りは、この振りはみんな、どうだったかな？いいでしょ？
But what did everyone think of this choreo that Sui-chan likes? It's good, right?

59
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:58,533
はい、ということで、今日はね、あの常闇トワの誕生日なんです！
Yes, so today is Tokoyami Towa's birthday!

60
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:01,533
ハッピーバースデー・トゥー・ミー！
Happy Birthday to me!

61
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:08,533
はい、みんなハッピーバースデーありがとう。あ、はいコメントでもね、多分ね、多分って何だろうね。
Yes, thank you everyone for the happy birthday. Oh, and in the comments too, probably...

62
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:14,533
もう先読みで、あ、ありがとう！ハッピーバースデーありがとうね！
Already anticipating it, oh, thank you! Thank you for the happy birthday!

63
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:22,533
はい、先読み完了。ということで、はい、じゃあね今日のハッシュタグは…
Yes, anticipation complete. So, okay, today's hashtag is...

65
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:33,533
ぜひぜひトレンドにも入りたいので、もういっぱい呟いてくんないと…
I really want to get into the trends, so if you don't tweet a lot...

66
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:37,033
怒っちゃうぞ！
I'll get angry!

67
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,533
はい、気持ち悪いということで。
Yes, that was gross.

68
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:45,033
はい、じゃあね、今日の配信は、なんと、なんと、いつもはね、トークしたりとかちょっとしながら歌ってライブをするんだけど…
So today's stream is, amazingly, usually I talk a bit while singing for the live, but...

69
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:49,533
今日は、もう歌をいっぱい歌いたいなと思っているので、トークは短め！
Today I want to sing lots of songs, so the talk will be short!

70
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:54,033
いっぱい歌うのでたくさん見てください！聞いてね！
I'll sing a lot, so please watch a lot! Listen, okay!

71
00:08:54,033 --> 00:09:02,533
ちょっとこだわりもあるんでね、ちゃんと見ていっぱい聞いて見ていっぱい聞いていっぱい呟いてくれたら嬉しいな。
I've put a lot into this, so I'd be happy if you watched and listened carefully and tweeted a lot.

72
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:09,533
はい、では、この後は、トワの好きな曲をたくさんのゲストといっぱい歌いますので聞いてください！
Yes, so after this, I'll be singing songs I like with many guests, so please listen!

73
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:14,533
では、ゲストコーナーへどうぞ！ボーン！
Well then, on to the guest corner! Boom!

74
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:29,533
白銀の獅子は　駆けて　駆けて　駆け続けている
The silver lioness is running, running, keeps on running

75
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:36,733
もう不安に振り返ることはないから
Because there's no more looking back in anxiety

76
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:43,833
百獣の王は　九十九を信じるから王なんだ
The king of beasts is a king because she believes in the ninety-nine

77
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:49,633
Be hard, the pride, and that's the pride

78
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:53,033
それこそ私の誇り
That is precisely my pride

79
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:37,033
Lioness' Pride
作詞・作曲：かめりあ
Lioness' Pride
Lyrics/Composition: Camellia

80
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:08,565
ここを独り抗って
Resisting here alone,

81
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:15,405
ずっと独りなんだろうって思ってた
I thought I'd be alone forever.

82
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,105
前だけ睨んで
Gazing only forward,

83
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:18,565
ただ命懸けて
simply risking my life,

84
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:21,325
足跡見失って
losing sight of my footsteps.

85
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:23,555
変わらないと
Knowing things won't change,

86
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:24,975
交わさないと
knowing we won't interact,

87
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:28,225
はぐれ山猫だって笑った
I laughed at being a stray wildcat.

88
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:34,265
音もなかった世界 満ちて広げてゆく
Filling and expanding a silent world.

89
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:40,895
人たちの声や生の目に 絆されて
Enchanted by the voices of people and their living eyes.

90
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:47,205
私は変わりつつ 蕾のライオンです
I am changing, a lion in the bud.

91
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:54,445
尖った爪を研ぐ 友の前歩くため
Sharpening my pointed claws to walk before my friends.

92
00:10:56,285 --> 00:11:02,625
真っ白い獅子は 群れて群れて群れを抱く
The pure white lion herds and herds, embracing the pride.

93
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:08,865
それが私を支えてくれるから
Because that is what supports me.

94
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:15,725
誇れる場所を 謳え謳え 飢える者たち
Sing and sing of this place of pride, you hungry ones.

95
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:17,245
WE HAVE THE PRIDE IN

96
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:19,045
OR IS THE PRIDE

97
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:21,845
それこそは 私の誇り
That is my pride.

98
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:43,225
蹴ら 飼い殺して 縄張りの
Kicking... keeping them tamed within the territory,

99
00:11:44,065 --> 00:11:49,765
線を 今日も無差別に引いてた
indiscriminately drawing lines today as well.

100
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:53,085
目指した物だけ 輝く物だけ
Only the things I aimed for, only the things that shine,

101
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:56,555
そして ただ 迷うだけ
and then, simply getting lost.

102
00:11:57,105 --> 00:11:59,125
見失い軌道 噂の元を
Losing the trajectory, tracing the source of rumors,

103
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:03,195
導き出してる 築いたあの日
deriving it all since the day I realized.

104
00:12:03,585 --> 00:12:09,325
溶けなかった 凍土にやがて広がりゆく
On the permafrost that wouldn't melt, it eventually spreads.

105
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:15,585
私たちの根っこ 少しずつ 肥えていくから
Our roots are gradually growing rich.

106
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:21,945
明日をずっと 今日離れていても
Even if we are far apart today or tomorrow,

107
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:29,205
寂しげに 向け微笑む 友に声届けるため
to deliver my voice to the friend who smiles lonely at me.

108
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:37,445
一輪の獅子は 咲いて咲いて 咲き誇りたいのさ
The single lion wants to bloom and bloom in full glory.

109
00:12:37,705 --> 00:12:43,555
燃えいづ時は 見守る人のために
When it burns out, it's for those who watch over us.

110
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:50,445
百歌の王は 一緒に一緒に 咲き誇りたいのさ
The king of a hundred songs wants to bloom together in glory.

111
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:56,265
WE CAN BE THE KING OF BEASTS TOGETHER

112
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:06,175
白銀の獅子は 駆けて駆けて 駆け続けてる
The silver lion runs and runs, continuing to run.

113
00:13:06,705 --> 00:13:11,795
どこを振り返ることはないから
Because there's nowhere to look back to.

114
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:18,885
百獣の王は 救世を信じ カラーを名乗るさ
The king of beasts believes in salvation and shows its colors.

115
00:13:19,205 --> 00:13:20,805
今はまだ前だよ
We're still moving forward.

116
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:22,605
この夢だけを
With only this dream,

117
00:13:22,605 --> 00:13:24,445
見て走っていられる
I can keep on running.

118
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:31,295
後ろに大切なわがたちの 群れの元があるから
Because behind us lies the foundation of our precious pride.

119
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:33,245
WE HAVE THE PRIDE IN

120
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,105
OR IS THE PRIDE

121
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:38,295
それこそは 私の誇り
That is my pride.

122
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:27,045
High Tide
作詞・作曲・編曲：ZSunder
High Tide
Lyrics, Composition, Arrangement: ZSunder

123
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:35,885
When you look up at the night sky, what do you see?

124
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:42,145
The glowing beauty in the twilight, it's no mystery

125
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:45,245
Now watch me at the scene, I'll light it all up

126
00:14:45,245 --> 00:14:48,345
When the time has come, I'll be rising high

127
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:53,225
Longing for me like a lifeline, whenever you see

128
00:14:53,345 --> 00:14:57,705
my shine

129
00:14:58,155 --> 00:15:00,045
I'll catch your eye

130
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:03,257
Ah...

131
00:15:03,507 --> 00:15:06,807
Its pulling you in like gravity

132
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:10,007
You will be bowing on your knees yeah

133
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:13,207
Pulling you in close to me

134
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:15,707
Watch my glory and might

135
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,207
Following me like a high tide

136
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:20,707
My reign will never stop

137
00:15:20,707 --> 00:15:24,107
The tide begins to rise up to the top

138
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:26,607
Let my power ignite

139
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:29,107

It's no surprise

142
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,307
But you'll give in to the brilliance

作詞・作曲:Junky
mayday,mayday
Lyrics & Composition: Junky

175
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:57,807
Mayday, mayday

176
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:22,689
メーデー声は届いてる 心がズキッと痛いみたい
Mayday, can you hear my voice? My heart feels a sharp pain

177
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:27,789
平然なんて魅力的に見せるテクニックはすぐにクラクラ
The technique of looking so charmingly calm, I'm already dizzy

178
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:32,689
メーデーそれじゃ物足りない すぐにもっともっと欲張りな
Mayday, that's not enough, soon even more and more greedily

179
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:37,689
ヘイヘイもっと焦らしてよ あなたの心に入っていたいの
Hey hey, tease me more, I want to be in your heart

180
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:42,589
あぁ 見透いた甘い罠
Ah, a transparent sweet trap

181
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:47,389
あぁ はめてあげようか
Ah, shall I set it for you?

182
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:57,489
あぁ 自在にコントロールしていたはずなのに
Ah, I thought I was controlling it freely

183
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:02,689
クラクラしちゃうぞ 眩暈倍誘われ
Making me dizzy, the dizziness is doubled by the invitation

184
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:07,689
クラクラしちゃった あぁ もうお手上げ
I've become dizzy, ah, I give up now

185
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:12,689
逃げたいわけじゃなくてね クラクラが丁度いい
It's not that I want to run away, this dizziness is just right

186
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:18,489
なんて君の前じゃ絶対 ヘルプミーして
Saying that in front of you, definitely "Help me"

187
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:33,089
メーデー舵が取れないの 気持ちがモヤっと晴れないし
Mayday, I can't take the helm, my feelings are hazy and won't clear up

188
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:38,289
メーデー何か言いたいね 今どき身の程もちょうどもちょうどもちょうど
Mayday, I want to say something, nowadays my status is also just right

189
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:43,289
絶対あるわけないじゃない 絶対にただの勘違い
There's no way it's true, it's definitely just a misunderstanding

190
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:48,489
場外蹴散らすヒラのワザ 踊らされているこの感じ
Outside the ring, a commoner's skill, this feeling of being danced around

191
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:53,289
とっても溶け出すような体温に満たされ
Being filled with a body temperature that seems to melt away

192
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:58,589
願ったアタシじゃないダイタイ ホーレスミー
The me I didn't wish for, mostly "Bless me"

193
00:20:00,069 --> 00:22:04,069
mayday,mayday

194
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,389
だってもう絶対プライドにあって
Because I'm already certainly in my pride

195
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:02,919
私を困らせて
Troubling me

196
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:04,349
なんとも私笑わせたい
Somehow I want to make you laugh

197
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:05,849
絶対
Absolutely

198
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:08,519
レスミーして
Rescue me

199
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,569
ねえ、どうして
Hey, why

200
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:25,869
愛はいたずらするんだろう
Does love play tricks on us?

201
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:32,469
ねえ、傷は
Hey, as for the wounds

202
00:20:32,469 --> 00:20:37,369
細かい痛みも消えるな
Don't let even the smallest pains disappear

203
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:52,869
本来は案外簡単に
Normally, unexpectedly easily

204
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:56,569
否定して壊れちゃうけど
It's denied and broken, but

205
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:03,269
気がつけば手を伸ばしちゃって
Before I knew it, I reached out my hand

206
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:05,719
その体苦しくて
That body is painful

207
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:10,569
君も手を伸ばしてくれ　ほら
You reach out your hand too, look

208
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:14,269
痛い　ここにいたいのがマイ
It hurts, I want to stay here, it's my...

209
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:19,469
落ち着く場所　その手で触れてよ
Calming place, touch it with those hands

210
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,369
ほらメイデイ
Look, Mayday

211
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:25,869
クラクラしちゃいそうな愛を　誘われ
Invited by a love that makes me dizzy

212
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:29,469
フラフラになっちゃわ　もう
I'm becoming lightheaded already

213
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:33,469
Help me!

214
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:35,369
Rescue me!

215
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:37,869
Save me!

216
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:40,469
Mayday!

217
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:44,869
だってもう　駆け出すような愛を
Because already, a love that feels like running out

218
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:47,369
嫌まわり　吐きだそう
Venting out the unpleasantness

219
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:50,869
溢れ出したんだ
It started to overflow

220
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:53,369
もうレスミーして
Rescue me already

221
00:22:14,569 --> 00:25:01,269
ALICE&u

222
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:20,569
All my eyes deceive with me, your soul starts to fade

223
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:23,269
Unleash your magic to me

224
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:28,069
Now it's time not to worry to be in between me

225
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:31,569
A journey we have to see

226
00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:36,269
Lurida rarira incomplete melody

227
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:39,869
Sung with a sweet but yet so sad symphony

228
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:44,669
Our bounds and feelings start to flow to me

229
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:49,069
I can't find a way when you're not even here

230
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:51,569
Always me

231
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:57,169
Let all the words I could say to you right now

232
00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:00,869
I can't believe that you are the one for me

233
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:05,569
Would you come with me to the darkness

234
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:10,569
It's a kiss that never ever ever with everything

235
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:14,669
Let the time send this song to your ears, I hope

236
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:18,869
And we will sing it to the most of melody

237
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:22,569
The magic that we've lost

238
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:30,569
Every day I would pray my heart reached as far

239
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:42,569
Even type of worry in the light I could see

240
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:46,869
Do you want me to be here?

241
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:51,169
Knowing all the emotions you're supposed to feel

242
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:55,369
Even voice I want to hear

243
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:59,369
Shalala shalira incomplete melody

244
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:03,569
I'll be in your ears is destiny

245
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:07,569
Lurida rarira incomplete memory

246
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:12,569
Showing all the realm that I have ever feel

247
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:16,869
Yooh-mmm-there-sing it!

248
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:20,369
Shalala!

249
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:24,469
夜の曲
Night song

250
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:28,069
Shalala!

251
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:32,469
声よ燃える
My voice, burn

252
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:39,469
マジック紡ぐの欠片たちは
The fragments of the magic we've spun

253
00:24:39,469 --> 00:24:43,669
今光になる
Are becoming light now

254
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:48,369
新たな喜びを
A new joy...

255
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:50,869
歌おう
Let's sing

256
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:54,669
Lurida rarira incomplete melody...

257
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,581
legacy

258
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:04,581
Let the wind, let the sea carry this melody

259
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:06,281
legacy

260
00:25:06,281 --> 00:25:09,581
Timeless song that carry all the wish

261
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:14,581
I believe

262
00:25:17,581 --> 00:25:22,581
All the words I could say right now,
I can only tell you a little bit

263
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:34,581
Overwhelmingly too captivated to ever be able
to leave with every scene

264
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:43,081
Let the time send this sound to you,
I hope that you will sing it to me

265
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:50,081
Lost of the melodies that I tried to love

266
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:57,081
Everyday I will sing it aloud and I will try to shine

267
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:02,581
この声を聴いて
Listen to this voice

268
00:26:02,581 --> 00:26:06,081
足りない歌詞を足そう
Let's add the missing lyrics

269
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:10,081
Apa arti yang telah kuterima
What is the meaning I have received

270
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:14,881
Hati yang telah kupendam
The heart I have kept inside

271
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:21,081
A gentle breeze pass to your soul this time

272
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:26,581
Everything will be fine

273
00:26:26,581 --> 00:26:31,581
Everyday I will sing it aloud
this is my time to shine

274
00:27:01,581 --> 00:27:05,081
常闇の闇に囚われたまま
Trapped in the darkness of the eternal night

275
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:08,581
奏でる悲鳴を
The screams I play

276
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:10,081
聞かせて
Let me hear them

277
00:27:24,881 --> 00:27:27,581
さぁ 爪を研いだら
Now, once you've sharpened your claws

278
00:27:27,581 --> 00:27:31,581
まだ子供のようなあなたのために
For you, who are still like a child

279
00:27:31,581 --> 00:27:35,081
あぁ 試されたいなら
Ah, if you want to be tested

280
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:39,081
その愚かな手に手錠をかけて
Put handcuffs on those foolish hands

281
00:27:39,081 --> 00:27:42,581
常闇の闇に囚われたまま
Trapped in the darkness of the eternal night

282
00:27:42,581 --> 00:27:46,081
甘い甘いガムを噛んでいた
I was chewing sweet, sweet gum

283
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:50,581
幾つもの後悔を
Countless regrets

284
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:53,081
捧げて
Offer them up

285
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:57,081
さりげない合図に隠れた
Hidden in a casual signal

286
00:27:57,081 --> 00:28:00,581
答えはすぐにわからせてあげる
I'll let you know the answer soon

287
00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:04,081
微笑な嘘にまみれた
Covered in subtle lies

288
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:08,081
拒んだままに受け止めてあげる
I'll accept you as you refuse

289
00:28:08,081 --> 00:28:11,581
ほら悲鳴を聞かせて
Come on, let me hear the screams

290
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:29,581
さぁ 指を鳴らしたら
Now, once you've snapped your fingers

291
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:33,581
この子猫のような私のために
For me, who am like this kitten

292
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:36,581
あら 喉が渇いたわ
Oh, I'm thirsty

293
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:40,881
薄紅の口に指を散らして
Scattering fingers on light crimson lips

294
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:44,581
狭い檻に閉じ込めたまま
While locked in a narrow cage

295
00:28:44,581 --> 00:28:48,081
首輪に繋がれたいのだ
I want to be tied to a collar

296
00:28:48,081 --> 00:28:51,281
くだらないルールじゃ奪えない
Can't be taken by trivial rules

297
00:28:51,281 --> 00:28:55,081
自由はすでにこの手の中にある
Freedom is already in these hands

298
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:58,581
愛情では計れない
Can't be measured with affection

299
00:28:58,581 --> 00:29:02,581
弱ったままに選ばせてあげる
I'll let you choose while you're weak

300
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:06,081
ほら心を開いて
Come on, open your heart

301
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:16,581
わからないふりをして
Pretending not to know

302
00:29:16,581 --> 00:29:20,081
寝惚けてるの？
Are you half-asleep?

303
00:29:20,081 --> 00:29:24,081
もっと熱い暗闇を見せて
Show me a hotter darkness

304
00:29:24,081 --> 00:29:28,081
ねぇ
Hey

305
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:32,081
さりげない合図に隠れた
Hidden in a casual signal

306
00:29:32,081 --> 00:29:36,081
答えはすぐにわからせてあげる
I'll let you know the answer soon

307
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:39,581
微笑な嘘にまみれた
Covered in subtle lies

308
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:43,081
拒んだままに受け止めてあげる
I'll accept you as you refuse

309
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:48,581
常闇の闇に刻むこの名を
Carving this name into the eternal darkness

310
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:51,081
わからせてあげる
I'll make you understand

311
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:56,081
ほら悲鳴を聞かせてよ
Come on, let me hear the screams

312
00:29:56,081 --> 00:30:00,081
夢見ないで
Don't dream

313
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,393
ご覧になって
Look at me,

314
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:03,093
確かめて
and make sure.

315
00:30:33,493 --> 00:30:36,193
風に吹かれて
Blown by the wind,

316
00:30:36,193 --> 00:30:39,493
誰も気づかぬよう
so that no one notices,

317
00:30:39,493 --> 00:30:42,593
区別がつかない
I can't tell the difference in

318
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:45,926
モノクロの世界
this monochrome world.

319
00:30:45,926 --> 00:30:48,926
色を足しても
Even if I add color,

320
00:30:48,926 --> 00:30:52,093
何も見えなくて
I can't see anything.

321
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:54,726
まるで私は
It's as if I

322
00:30:54,726 --> 00:30:58,593
息を止めていた
had stopped breathing.

323
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,526
もういいよ
That's enough.

324
00:31:03,526 --> 00:31:06,226
遠くても叶えたい
Even if it's far, I want to make it come true.

325
00:31:06,226 --> 00:31:08,626
私は
I am...

326
00:31:08,626 --> 00:31:11,826
越えぬ世界 想いも
A world I cannot cross, the feelings too.

327
00:31:11,826 --> 00:31:14,726
抱きしめていたのに
Even though I was holding them tight,

328
00:31:14,726 --> 00:31:17,659
夢のキャンバスに
on the canvas of dreams,

329
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:20,626
生き続ける意味は
the meaning of continuing to live,

330
00:31:20,626 --> 00:31:23,626
この胸に
within this heart,

331
00:31:23,626 --> 00:31:27,126
輝いている Story
is a shining story.

332
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:40,926
明かり灯りに
To light the light,

333
00:31:40,926 --> 00:31:44,293
意味などないけれど
it doesn't have any meaning, but

334
00:31:44,293 --> 00:31:47,426
拾い集めた
I gathered up

335
00:31:47,426 --> 00:31:50,593
欠片 失うの？
the pieces. Will I lose them?

336
00:31:50,593 --> 00:31:53,426
そして夜は その冷たさを
And the night, its coldness,

337
00:31:53,426 --> 00:31:56,659
溶かして手を伸ばした
it melted away as I reached out my hand.

338
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,259
もういいよ
That's enough.

339
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:05,026
遠くても届けたい
Even if it's far, I want to reach it.

340
00:32:05,026 --> 00:32:08,426
私は受け止めていく
I will keep accepting it.

341
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,093
涙も
Even the tears,

342
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:13,926
抱きしめていたのに
even though I was holding them tight,

343
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:16,926
夢のキャンバスに
on the canvas of dreams,

344
00:32:16,926 --> 00:32:19,559
心込めるのは
putting my heart into it,

345
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:22,659
この空に
in this sky,

346
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:25,859
描き出していく Story
I'm drawing out a story.

347
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:40,493
そして夜は その冷たさを
And the night, its coldness,

348
00:32:40,493 --> 00:32:43,193
溶かして手を伸ばした
it melted away as I reached out my hand.

349
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:49,926
もういいよ
That's enough.

350
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,659
遠くても叶えたい
Even if it's far, I want to make it come true.

351
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:54,493
私の
My...

352
00:32:54,493 --> 00:32:57,726
越えぬ世界 想いも
world I cannot cross, the feelings too,

353
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,659
言葉で包んだ
I wrapped them in words.

354
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:03,559
夢のキャンバスに
On the canvas of dreams,

355
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:06,593
色を足していく
I'm adding colors.

356
00:33:06,593 --> 00:33:09,393
この胸に
In this heart,

357
00:33:09,393 --> 00:33:12,426
今輝いて
it's shining now.

358
00:33:12,426 --> 00:33:15,393
強くなくてもいい
It's okay not to be strong.

359
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:18,326
壊れかけてもいい
It's okay if it starts to break.

360
00:33:18,326 --> 00:33:21,159
この心は永遠に羽ばたいて
This heart will fly forever.

361
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:27,426
響くように
So it resonates,

362
00:33:27,426 --> 00:33:30,526
塗り替えていく パレット
I'll keep repainting the palette.

363
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:03,426
だって僕は星だから
Because I'm a star.

364
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,593
Stellar Stellar

365
00:34:26,593 --> 00:34:29,493
きっと君はもう気づいていた
Surely you've already noticed.

366
00:34:29,493 --> 00:34:32,493
僕の心の奥で欠いた
Missing from deep in my heart.

367
00:34:32,493 --> 00:34:35,426
それがこれから話す陳腐な
That's the trite monologue

368
00:34:35,426 --> 00:34:37,859
モノローグさ
I'm about to tell you.

369
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:40,593
ずっと言えない言葉があった
There were words I could never say.

370
00:34:40,593 --> 00:34:43,526
壊せない壁があったんだ
There was a wall I couldn't break down.

371
00:34:43,526 --> 00:34:47,526
ずっとさ
Always.

372
00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:51,459
ふっと香り立つ朝の匂いが
The scent of the morning that suddenly arises,

373
00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:54,359
どうしようもなく憎らしくて
is so hopelessly hateful.

374
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,259
部屋の隅で膝を抱えて
Curled up in the corner of the room,

375
00:34:57,259 --> 00:35:00,093
震えていた
I was trembling.

376
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:04,055
太陽なんていらないから
I don't need something like the sun

377
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:07,563
明けないでいて
Don't let the dawn break

378
00:35:09,689 --> 00:35:12,605
その手を伸ばして
Reach out that hand

379
00:35:13,105 --> 00:35:16,189
誰かに届くように
So that it reaches someone

380
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:21,147
僕だって君と同じ
I'm the same as you

381
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:28,647
特別なんかじゃないから
Because I'm not special or anything

382
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:34,605
そうさ僕は夜を歌うよ Stellar Stellar
That's right, I'll sing of the night, Stellar Stellar

383
00:35:35,147 --> 00:35:37,689
ありったけの輝きで
With all the brilliance I have

384
00:35:38,647 --> 00:35:41,689
今宵 音楽はずっとずっと止まらない
Tonight, the music will never, ever stop

385
00:35:43,147 --> 00:35:45,605
そうさ僕がずっと　なりたかったのは
That's right, what I've always wanted to be

386
00:35:46,147 --> 00:35:49,105
待ってるシンデレラじゃないさ
Isn't a Cinderella who just waits

387
00:35:51,147 --> 00:35:54,147
迎えに行く王子様だ
It's the prince who goes to meet them

388
00:35:57,189 --> 00:36:00,189
だって僕は星だから
Because I am a star

389
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:13,147
なんてありふれた話なんだ
What a commonplace story

390
00:36:14,147 --> 00:36:16,647
理想だけ書き連ねていた
I was just writing down my ideals

391
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:21,147
ノートの隅に眠るほんのワンシーンだ
Just a single scene sleeping in the corner of my notebook

392
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:24,147
きっとあの星も泣いてるんだ
I'm sure that star is crying too

393
00:36:25,147 --> 00:36:29,647
明日なんて来ないままでいて
Let tomorrow never come

394
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,605
その手を伸ばして
Reach out that hand

395
00:36:35,147 --> 00:36:38,105
誰かに届くように
So that it reaches someone

396
00:36:40,147 --> 00:36:44,147
本当に大切なものは目に
The things that are truly important

397
00:36:47,189 --> 00:36:52,105
見えないみたいなんだ
Seem to be invisible to the eye

398
00:36:54,147 --> 00:36:56,647
そうさ僕は夜を歌うよ Stellar Stellar
That's right, I'll sing of the night, Stellar Stellar

399
00:36:57,147 --> 00:36:59,647
ありのまま 震えないで
Just as you are, don't tremble

400
00:37:00,189 --> 00:37:03,647
今宵 音楽はきっときっと止まらない
Tonight, the music will surely, surely not stop

401
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:07,647
そうさ僕がずっと　なりたかったのは
That's right, what I've always wanted to be

402
00:37:08,189 --> 00:37:11,647
あえかなヒロインじゃないさ
Isn't a faint heroine

403
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:18,147
救いに行くヒーローだ
It's the hero who goes to save

404
00:37:22,147 --> 00:37:28,189
夢見がちな おとぎ話
A dreamy fairy tale

405
00:37:30,189 --> 00:37:35,189
おとぎ話
Fairy tale

406
00:37:43,189 --> 00:37:45,647
そうさ僕は夜を歌うよ Stellar Stellar
That's right, I'll sing of the night, Stellar Stellar

407

ありったけの輝きで
With all the brilliance I have

408
00:37:49,189 --> 00:37:52,647
今宵 音楽はずっとずっと止まらない

409
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,647
そうさ僕は愛を歌うよ Stellar Stellar

In the middle of the world and the universe

411
00:38:00,189 --> 00:38:03,147
今宵 音楽はきっときっと止まらない

412
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:07,647
そうさ僕がずっと　なりたかったのは

迎えに行く王子様だ
It's the prince who goes to meet them

415
00:38:18,189 --> 00:38:22,147
だって僕は星だから
Because I am a star

416
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:38,105
そうだ 僕は星だった
That's right, I was a star

417
00:38:43,189 --> 00:38:49,105
Stellar Stellar

418
00:39:08,855 --> 00:39:14,605
はーい、ではどうでしたでしょうか？ゲストコーナーでした！
Hi! So, how was that? That was the guest corner!

419
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:25,605
はい、今回はね、あのトワのオリジナル曲、そしてゲストさんのオリジナル曲をトワと一緒に歌うという構成にしてみました。
Yes, this time, I made it a setlist where I sing my original songs and the guest's original songs together with me.

420
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:38,605
どうだったかな？ね、トワがね、あの好きな曲をすごい一緒に歌ってもいいかなって言ったら、みんな快く歌おうって言ってくれて、一緒に歌って踊ることができました。
How was it? When I asked if I could sing the songs I love together with them, everyone kindly agreed, and we were able to sing and dance together.

421
00:39:39,105 --> 00:39:51,605
ま、特にね、あのインドネシア組のムナとリス、初めて一緒に歌って踊ったので、すごい嬉しかったなっていう感じです。イェーイ！
Well, especially Moona and Risu from the Indonesia branch, it was my first time singing and dancing with them, so I'm really happy about that. Yay!

422
00:39:52,105 --> 00:39:59,105
すごい、いろんなね、あのワルツっぽい踊りもあれば、ちょっとかっこいい踊りとかもあって、いっぱいいっぱい練習して...
There were many different types of dances, like waltz-like ones and some cool ones, so we practiced a lot...

423
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:03,117
で、今日トワどんだけいっぱいっていうの？やばいって。
And how many "ippai" did I say today? It's crazy.

424
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:08,117
え、すごい、たくさんの量を練習しまして、
Uh, I practiced a lot,

425
00:40:08,117 --> 00:40:12,117
あの、こういう形でね、きれいにすごいできて嬉しいです！
and I'm happy it turned out so beautifully like this!

426
00:40:12,117 --> 00:40:14,417
イエーイ！
Yay!

427
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:18,517
ま、あの、ま、いっぱいね、この、またいっぱいって言っちゃった。今日はね、いっぱいに囚われる日なの。
Well, I said "ippai" again.
Today is a day of being obsessed with "ippai".

428
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:20,117
ごめん。
Sorry.

429
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:25,117
この、あ、喋れなくなってきた。
This, ah, I'm losing my ability to talk.

430
00:40:25,117 --> 00:40:29,117
これ、意識すると喋れなーーいって！
See, when I become conscious of it, I can't talk!

431
00:40:29,117 --> 00:40:33,517
まあ、後日ね、感想枠やりたいと思うので、そこで、
Well, I want to do a review stream later, so there,

432
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:37,617
多くの量を、あの、話せるようになればいいなと思います。
I hope I can talk a lot then.

433
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:40,517
イエーイ！
Yay!

434
00:40:40,517 --> 00:40:44,417

452
00:41:52,617 --> 00:41:57,117
トワがね、サインを一枚一枚、直筆で書きたいと思うので、
I'll be signing each and every one of them by hand,

453
00:41:57,117 --> 00:42:01,117
ぜひぜひ、フルセット買ってくれたら嬉しいなーと思います。
so I'd be very happy if you'd buy the full set.

454
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:04,617
はい、ではこのグッズはね、配信が終わってから購入できるようになるので、
Yes, so these goods will be available for purchase
after the stream ends,

455
00:42:04,617 --> 00:42:08,617
購入してくださーーい！
so please buy them!

456
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:13,117
はい、以上グッズの、グッズの詳細でした。ま、単品でもね、買えるのでね、いっぱい買ってください。
That was the details of the goods.
You can buy them individually too, so buy lots!

457
00:42:13,117 --> 00:42:16,917
はい。ま、ということでね、
Yes. Well, having said that,

458
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:22,117
常闇トワのソロが少ねえんじゃねえかと思った、そこのあなた。
to those of you who thought
Tokoyami Towa's solos were a bit few.

459
00:42:22,117 --> 00:42:26,417
あなた、あなた。
You, you.

460
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:30,117
トワ、この後ラスト頑張っていきたいと思うので、
I want to do my best for the last part after this,

461
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:34,117
最後まで聞いてってね、よろしく！
so please listen until the end, okay! Thanks!

462
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:37,817
はい、ではソロ、歌います！ドーン！
Alright, now I'll sing a solo! Boom!

463
00:42:37,817 --> 00:42:40,117
ってなんだ？はい！
What was that? Yes!

464
00:43:07,617 --> 00:43:11,817
青い惑星に生まれて
Born on a blue planet

465
00:43:11,817 --> 00:43:16,117
違う道を歩いて
Walking a different path

466
00:43:16,117 --> 00:43:19,517
辿り着いたこの街
I arrived at this city

467
00:43:19,517 --> 00:43:23,117
光る粒が弾けた
Glowing particles burst

468
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:26,817
巡る夜にキミと出会い
Meeting you in the revolving night

469
00:43:26,817 --> 00:43:30,417
いつの間にか手を繋いで
Before I knew it, we were holding hands

470
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:34,017
笑い声と弾む足で
With laughter and bouncy steps

471
00:43:34,017 --> 00:43:38,317
どこまでも駆けるミッドナイト
Running anywhere in the midnight

472
00:43:38,317 --> 00:43:43,117
見上げた空 星の光
Looking up at the sky, the starlight

473
00:43:43,117 --> 00:43:47,417
街のネオンが混じり合って
Mixing with the city's neon lights

474
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:51,217
憂鬱な日々を忘れて
Forgetting the melancholic days

475
00:43:51,217 --> 00:43:55,317
全部 捨て去って
Throwing everything away

476
00:43:55,317 --> 00:43:59,417
ボクらもっと自由なはず
We should be much freer

477
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:02,917
閉ざした羽を開いたなら
If we open our closed wings

478
00:44:02,917 --> 00:44:06,517
退屈な日々にさよなら
Goodbye to the boring days

479
00:44:06,517 --> 00:44:11,217
夜の街を行こう さあ
Let's go through the night city, come on

480
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:21,017
ビルを抜けて
Passing through the buildings

481
00:44:21,017 --> 00:44:24,517
街を追い越して
Overtaking the city

482
00:44:24,517 --> 00:44:28,117
さらば青い惑星
Farewell, blue planet

483
00:44:28,117 --> 00:44:32,517
なんて惚けてどこまで行こう
Going anywhere with such absent-mindedness

484
00:44:32,517 --> 00:44:37,817
変わらないものなど
Things that don't change

485
00:44:37,817 --> 00:44:41,217
何もないから
Because there are none

486
00:44:41,217 --> 00:44:44,817
たった一つ
Only one

487
00:44:44,817 --> 00:44:49,117
確かな今を刻んで
Carving out the certain present

488
00:45:04,095 --> 00:45:07,595
踊る夜にキミを連れて
Taking you along on this dancing night

489
00:45:07,595 --> 00:45:11,529
邪魔なものは何らもなくて
There's nothing to get in our way

490
00:45:11,529 --> 00:45:15,295
歌う声と軽い足で
With singing voices and light footsteps

491
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:19,095
いつまでも駆けるミッドナイト
Running through the midnight forever

492
00:45:20,629 --> 00:45:24,495
見上げた空 月の光
Looked up at the sky, the moonlight

493
00:45:24,495 --> 00:45:28,229
街の幻想が惹かれあって
The illusions of the city are drawn to each other

494
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:32,162
憂鬱な日々を忘れて
Forgetting the melancholic days

495
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:35,929
苦い 暗いはもう全部捨て去って
Bitterness and darkness, throw them all away now

496
00:45:35,929 --> 00:45:39,862
見上げた空 星の光
Looked up at the sky, the starlight

497
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:43,662
街のネオンが混じり合って
The city's neon lights are mixing

498
00:45:43,662 --> 00:45:47,462
退屈な日々にさよなら
Goodbye to the boring days

499
00:45:47,462 --> 00:45:51,362
ボクの手を取ってさあ
Take my hand, come on

500
00:46:33,129 --> 00:46:35,862
最後は常闇トワオリジナル曲
The last one is a Tokoyami Towa original song

501
00:46:35,862 --> 00:46:37,895
本日初披露
Performing for the first time today

502
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:39,062
新曲
New song

503
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:41,029
「ライメイ」
“Raimei”

504
00:46:42,362 --> 00:46:46,462
だって、私いつまでもずっと虜
Because I'll always be captivated

505
00:46:46,462 --> 00:46:50,262
君以外はもうありえない
It can't be anyone but you anymore

506
00:46:50,262 --> 00:46:53,729
ちょっといつもふらふら
Always a bit unsteady

507
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:54,929
そっぽ向くの？
Are you looking away?

508
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:58,829
思わせぶり許さないからね
I won't forgive those suggestive looks

509
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:00,362
好きだよって
Saying “I love you”

510
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:02,229
かわいいねって
Saying “You're cute”

511
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:04,262
甘やかして盲信
Spoiling me, blind faith

512
00:47:04,262 --> 00:47:05,995
あのね　無理だよって
You know, saying it's impossible

513
00:47:05,995 --> 00:47:07,962
いけるよって
Saying we can do it

514
00:47:07,962 --> 00:47:09,729
揺れたって落魄
Even if we waver, downfall

515
00:47:09,729 --> 00:47:11,829
ガラスハートを振り回して
Swinging around my glass heart

516
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,729
骨の髄までしゃぶり尽くして
Devour me to the bone

517
00:47:13,729 --> 00:47:17,395
壊れるほど惑わせて
Bewilder me until I break

518
00:47:17,395 --> 00:47:19,495
you know, you know, you know

519
00:47:19,495 --> 00:47:21,362
love you

520
00:47:21,362 --> 00:47:23,195
手のひらで転がして
Roll me in your palm

521
00:47:23,195 --> 00:47:25,195
弩級時間を駆け抜けて
Running through tremendous time

522
00:47:25,195 --> 00:47:29,129
痺れる声はライメイ
The numbing voice is thunder

523
00:47:34,362 --> 00:47:37,462
勝手な妄想なんだけど
It's just my own delusion

524
00:47:37,462 --> 00:47:42,162
こっち向いて 君以外はもう愛せない
Look this way, I can't love anyone but you anymore

525
00:47:42,162 --> 00:47:45,462
きっと気分屋なんだけど
I'm probably just moody

526
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:49,895
いつか私、ヤキモチで狂いそうだから
Because someday I might go crazy with jealousy

527
00:47:49,895 --> 00:47:51,695
貢いじゃって
Spending on you

528
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:53,462
いらついちゃって
Getting annoyed

529
00:47:53,462 --> 00:47:55,429
突きつけたい銃口
Wanting to point the muzzle

530
00:47:55,429 --> 00:47:57,429
これはサンクコスト？
Is this a sunk cost?

531
00:47:57,429 --> 00:47:59,162
ただの愛憎？
Just love-hate?

532
00:47:59,162 --> 00:48:00,695
なんだっていいけど
Anything is fine though

533
00:48:00,695 --> 00:48:02,962
自分ファーストで手懐けて
Tame me with yourself first

534
00:48:02,962 --> 00:48:05,162
ぬくい鳥籠で飼い殺して
Keeping me in a warm birdcage

535
00:48:05,162 --> 00:48:08,662
あざといくらいの笑顔で
With a smile that's almost too calculating

536
00:48:08,662 --> 00:48:11,162
you know, you know, you know

537
00:48:11,162 --> 00:48:13,229
その熱量で不機嫌なのに
Even though I'm grumpy with that heat

538
00:48:13,229 --> 00:48:16,929
ヤバイキュートな身のこなしが
My crazy cute behavior

539
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:20,662
病を思うほど悩殺
Captivating to the point of sickness

540
00:48:25,629 --> 00:48:28,195
気分次第でもっと頂戴
Give me more depending on your mood

541
00:48:28,195 --> 00:48:30,462
幻だって That's all right
Even if it's a phantom, that's all right

542
00:48:30,462 --> 00:48:34,329
あぁ、このまま地獄へと
Ah, just like this, to hell

543
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:36,462
さあ生存 together
Now, survive together

544
00:48:36,462 --> 00:48:40,929
Low Low Low Low Low...

545
00:48:41,395 --> 00:48:45,362
La La La La La...

546
00:49:00,162 --> 00:49:02,162
ガラスハートを振り回して
Swinging around my glass heart

547
00:49:02,162 --> 00:49:05,895
歌った今までが全部
Everything I've sung up until now

548
00:49:05,895 --> 00:49:08,429
あなた自身の心だって
Is your own heart

549
00:49:08,429 --> 00:49:10,662
Do you know? you know? you know?

550
00:49:10,662 --> 00:49:12,495
love you

551
00:49:12,495 --> 00:49:14,362
手のひらで転がした
I rolled you in my palm

552
00:49:14,362 --> 00:49:16,462
私だけを愛していて
Keep on loving only me

553
00:49:16,462 --> 00:49:20,295
蠱惑的なほど痺れる恋はライメイ？
Is a love so numbing it's enchanting, thunder?

554
00:49:20,295 --> 00:49:22,395
蠱惑的なほど痺れる恋はライメイ
A love so numbing it's enchanting is thunder
