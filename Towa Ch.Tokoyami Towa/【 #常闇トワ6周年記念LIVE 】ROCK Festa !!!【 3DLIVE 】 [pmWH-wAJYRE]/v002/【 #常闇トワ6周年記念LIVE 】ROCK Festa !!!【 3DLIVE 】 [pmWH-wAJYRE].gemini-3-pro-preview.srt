なあ 納得いくまで話してよ
Hey, explain it until I'm satisfied.

127
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:41,409
どうせ屁理屈並べるんならバカみたい

ということは今年はトワちゃんの年ということでもいいでしょうか？
Does that mean it's okay to say this is Towa-chan's year?

137

ま、よくないか。いいか。
Well, maybe not. Or is it okay?

00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:32,869
えー、わたくしも休みの日ということで
And since I am also on holiday...

150
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:36,069
えー、本日のライブは全編収録となっております！
Today's live is entirely pre-recorded!

151
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,569

Thank you for your understanding!

152
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:40,969
そして
And then...

153
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:43,669
えー、この後はなんとゲストパート！
After this is the guest part!

154
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,969
いっぱい、いろんなね、ゲストが出てくれるので
Lots of different guests will be appearing...

So I hope you enjoy watching!

156
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:51,669
では
Well then...

157
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:54,669
ゲストパート、どうぞ！
Guest part, here we go!

158
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:32,669
闇を駆け抜けて どこへ向かう
Racing through the darkness, where do we go?

159
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:38,469
月明かりだけが ただ一つの道標
Only the moonlight is our single guidepost.

160
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:43,969
痛みも悲しみも 拭いきれず
Unable to wipe away the pain and sadness,

161
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:48,969
されどこの胸の 炎は消させない
Yet I won't let the fire in this chest be extinguished.

162
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:55,069
誰が為に僕たちは この想いを貫いて
For whose sake do we pierce through with these feelings?

163
00:16:55,869 --> 00:16:58,569
闇を裂き 日の下で
Tearing through the darkness, under the sun,

164
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:00,869
光射す日まで
Until the day light shines.

165
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:03,969
解き放たれた
Unleashed,

166
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:06,969
心に宿した火を
The fire dwelling in my heart.

167
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,669
舞い上げ纏え 今
Soar up and clad yourself in it, now,

168
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,969
夜明けの向こう側へ
To the other side of the dawn.

169
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:15,469
君がいるこの世界
This world where you exist,

170
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:18,569
もう一度愛せるまで
Until I can love it once more.

171
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:21,669
我が命 果てようとも
Even if my life should end,

172
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:23,469
繋いで行こう
Let's connect and go on,

173
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:26,069
絆が紡いで
Woven by bonds,

174
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:29,669
生まれた奇跡を
The miracle that was born.

175
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:38,669
喜怒哀楽 夢揺らめいてる
Emotions and dreams are wavering,

176
00:17:38,969 --> 00:17:40,469
写し世
In this transient world.

177
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:43,569
互いの正義を また繰り返し
Repeating each other's justice again,

178
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:46,169
振りかざす
Brandishing it.

179
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:49,469
誰が為に繋ぐ命
For whose sake is life connected?

180
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,169
交わりもつれる運命
Fates that cross and tangle.

181
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:55,069
蛇の道 数多の罪
The path of the snake, numerous sins,

182
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:57,969
全て薙ぎ払え
Mow them all down!

183
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:00,469
解き放て 今
Unleash it, now!

184
00:18:00,469 --> 00:18:03,469
僕らが起こした火を
The fire we ignited.

185
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:06,169
舞い上げ走れば
If we soar up and run,

186
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:09,369
明日が変わるはず
Tomorrow should change.

187
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:11,969
君といるこの世界
This world where I am with you,

188
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:15,169
二度と離さずに
Never letting go again.

189
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:18,069
君と共に往く
I will go with you.

190
00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:20,969
瞼を閉じても
Even if I close my eyes,

191
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:23,769
思い出すあの陽を
I remember that sun.

192
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,769
打ちのめされても
Even if beaten down,

193
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:29,369
焦がれた未来を
The future we yearned for.

194
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:32,069
いつの日か君に
One day, to you,

195
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:35,569
捧げてみせよう
I will dedicate it.

196
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:48,669
解き放たれた
Unleashed,

197
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,669
心に宿した火を
The fire dwelling in my heart.

198
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:54,469
舞い上げ纏え 今
Soar up and clad yourself in it, now,

199
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:57,369
夜明けの向こうへ
To beyond the dawn.

200
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,169
解き放て 今
Unleash it, now!

201
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:03,169
僕らが起こした火を
The fire we ignited.

202
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:05,969
舞い上げ走れば
If we soar up and run,

203
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:09,069
明日が変わるはず
Tomorrow should change.

204
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:11,669
君がいたこの世界
This world where you were,

205
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:14,869
もう一度愛せるまで
Until I can love it once more.

206
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:17,869
我が命 果てようとも
Even if my life should end,

207
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:19,669
繋げていくよ
I will connect it.

208
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:22,269
絆が紡いで
Woven by bonds,

209
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:26,069
生まれた奇跡を
The miracle that was born.

210
00:20:08,193 --> 00:20:11,693
抱きしめられた記憶から
From the memories of being held,

211
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:15,493
流れ出た赤い雫
Flowed red drops.

212
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:20,093
人様に見せるものじゃないの
It's not something to show others.

213
00:20:21,493 --> 00:20:23,893
伝えたかった言葉が
The words I wanted to convey

214
00:20:23,893 --> 00:20:27,193
もう一つの私になって
Became another version of me,

215
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:31,893
体の内側で何かを叫んでる
Screaming something from inside my body.

216
00:20:33,293 --> 00:20:34,893
あぁ 欲しかったのに
Ah, even though I wanted it...

217
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:37,893
悔しかったのに
Even though I was frustrated...

218
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:42,493
ダメだよ 全部隠しておくの
It's no good, I have to hide it all.

219
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:44,893
ごめんね
I'm sorry.

220
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:50,493
悲しいのは一人で十分だからと
Because one person being sad is enough,

221
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:55,693
これ以上醜くなりたくないのと
And I don't want to become any uglier than this.

222
00:20:57,293 --> 00:21:02,693
私の中で誰にも見つけられずに
Without being found by anyone inside me,

223
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:09,493
こんな色になるまで泣いていたんだね
You've been crying until you turned this color.

224
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:11,693
綺麗よ
It's beautiful.

225
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:26,493
私零れた心から
From my spilled heart,

226
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:30,093
流れ出た青い雫
Flowed blue drops.

227
00:21:30,893 --> 00:21:35,293
人様に見せるものじゃないの
It's not something to show others.

228
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:39,093
あぁ ずっと孤独を飲み込んで
Ah, always swallowing loneliness,

229
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:42,893
遠くの海 底に沈んで
Sinking to the bottom of a distant sea,

230
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:49,893
そのまま宝石にでもなれるのを待つ
Waiting to become a jewel just like that.

231
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:56,693
Wow...

232
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:02,693
本当は嘘で飾って
Actually decorating with lies,

233
00:22:02,893 --> 00:22:06,293
どこか満てない暮らしで慰めて
Consoling myself with a life unfulfilled somewhere.

234
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:11,893
誰かの悲劇で自分の悲劇を癒やして
Healing my own tragedy with someone else's tragedy.

235
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:18,893
悔しさに溺れた瞬間のままで
Staying in the moment drowned in frustration,

236
00:22:19,493 --> 00:22:24,093
息もできずただ愛してるの
I just love you, unable to even breathe.

237
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:30,493
悲しいのは一人で十分だからと
Because one person being sad is enough,

238
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:36,693
これ以上醜くなりたくないのと
And I don't want to become any uglier than this.

239
00:22:38,093 --> 00:22:42,893
私の中で誰にも見つけられずに
Without being found by anyone inside me,

240
00:22:44,293 --> 00:22:49,493
こんな色になるまで泣いていたんだね
You've been crying until you turned this color.

241
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:51,893
綺麗よ
It's beautiful.

242
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:58,293
ごめんね
I'm sorry.

243
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:04,493
ねえ 綺麗よ
Hey, it's beautiful.

244
00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:51,893
片っぽで丸を作って
Make a loop with one end,

245
00:23:51,893 --> 00:23:54,493
しっかり持ってて
Hold it tight.

246
00:23:56,093 --> 00:23:59,093
もう片っぽでその丸の後ろを
With the other end, go behind that loop,

247
00:23:59,093 --> 00:24:01,093
ぐるっと回って
Go all the way around.

248
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:05,693
間にできたポッケに入って
Go into the pocket made in between,

249
00:24:05,693 --> 00:24:08,093
出てくるの待ってて
Wait for it to come out.

250
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:12,293
出てきたところを迎えにきた
I came to meet it where it came out.

251
00:24:12,293 --> 00:24:14,693
せーので引っ張って
Pull on the count of three.

252
00:24:16,693 --> 00:24:18,693
はじめはなんとも
At first, it's nothing special,

253
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:22,093
情けない形だとしても
Even if the shape looks pathetic.

254
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:27,493
同じだけ力を込めて
Put in the same amount of strength.

255
00:24:33,093 --> 00:24:35,293
羽根は大きく
Make the wings big,

256
00:24:35,293 --> 00:24:38,693
結び目は固く
Make the knot tight.

257
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:41,693
なるようにきつく
As tight as it can be,

258
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:44,493
結んでいてほしいの
I want you to keep it tied.

259
00:24:46,893 --> 00:24:49,093
腕はここに
Your arm right here,

260
00:24:49,093 --> 00:24:52,093
想い出は遠くに
Memories far away.

261
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:56,093
置いて置いて
Leave them behind,

262
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:58,493
ほしいの
I want you to.

263
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:16,319
片っぽでも引っ張っちゃえば ほどけちゃうけど
If I pull just one end, it will unravel, but...

264
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:22,619
作ったもの壊すのは 遥かに簡単だけど
It's far easier to destroy something you've made, but...

265
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:29,819
だけどほどく時も そうちゃんと 同じようにね
But when we untie it, let's do it properly, just the same way.

266
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:33,319
分かってるよ
I know.

267
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:36,819
でもできたらね せーので引っ張って
But if we can, let's pull it together on the count of three.

268
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:43,619
ほどけやしないようにと願って 力込めては
Praying it won't come undone, I put all my strength into it.

269
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:49,319
広げすぎた羽根に
With wings spread too wide,

270
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:53,319
戸惑う
I feel bewildered.

271
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,019
羽根は大きく
Make the wings big,

272
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:00,819
結び目は固く
and the knot tight.

273
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:06,319
なるようにきつく 結んでいて
Tie it strictly so it becomes that way.

274
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:08,319
ほしいの
I want you to.

275
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,319
夢はここに
Dreams are here,

276
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,819
思い出は遠くに
and memories are far away.

277
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:21,319
日付はそこにあるくらいがいい
It's better if the date is just simply there.

278
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,019
黙って引っ張ったりしないでよ
Don't pull on it silently.

279
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,319
不格好な蝶にしないでよ
Don't turn it into a misshapen butterfly.

280
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:34,019
結んだつもりが ほどいてたり
Thinking we tied it, we were untying it,

281
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:38,819
緩めたつもりが 締めていたり
Thinking we loosened it, we were tightening it.

282
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:06,319
この蒼くて広い世界に
In this pale and vast world,

283
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:10,319
無数に散らばった中から
from among the countless scattered pieces,

284
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,319
別々に二人選んだ糸を
the threads we each chose separately,

285
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:17,319
お互い手繰り寄せ合ったんだ
we reeled them in towards each other.

286
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:21,019
結ばれたんじゃなく 結んだんだ
We weren't tied together; we tied it ourselves.

287
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:24,319
二人でせーので引っ張ったんだ
We pulled it together on the count of three.

288
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:29,319
大きくも小さくもなりすぎないように
So it wouldn't become too big or too small,

289
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,819
力を込めたんだ
we put our strength into it.

290
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:34,319
この蒼くて広い世界に
In this pale and vast world,

291
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,819
無数に散らばった中から
from among the countless scattered pieces,

292
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:41,819
別々に二人選んだ糸を
the threads we each chose separately,

293
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:44,819
お互い手繰り寄せ合ったんだ
we reeled them in towards each other.

294
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:48,319
結ばれたんじゃなく 結んだんだ
We weren't tied together; we tied it ourselves.

295
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,619
二人でせーので引っ張ったんだ
We pulled it together on the count of three.

296
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:56,819
大きくも小さくもなりすぎないように
So it wouldn't become too big or too small,

297
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:59,319
力を込めたんだ
we put our strength into it.

298
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:02,619
陰にそっと隠れるのがいいんじゃない？
Isn't it fine to just hide softly in the shadows?

299
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:07,619
蕾のような花だってあんじゃない
There are flowers that are like buds, aren't there?

300
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:12,319
秘密にして守るのがいいんじゃない？
Isn't it fine to keep it a secret and protect it?

301
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:17,819
誰にも邪魔されず 華麗に咲いてる
Blooming magnificently without being disturbed by anyone.

302
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:21,319
甘い苦いにハマんない
Don't get caught up in sweet or bitter.

303
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:23,619
その判断がくだんない
Those judgments are worthless.

304
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:28,319
気に病んで下を向かないでいて
Don't worry yourself sick and look down.

305
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:30,619
愛になれちゃいない
You haven't gotten used to love.

306
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:33,319
無駄に飾らない
Don't decorate yourself needlessly.

307
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:35,819
綺麗にされた花瓶も
A beautifully prepared vase,

308
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:38,319
肥やしもなにもいらない
fertilizer, or anything else—you don't need them.

309
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,819
その姿が美しい
That figure of yours is beautiful.

310
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,319
花になって
Become a flower.

311
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:49,319
ほら右左に笑って
Look, smile to the right and left.

312
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:52,619
その顔にぞくぞくして目が離せない
That face gives me chills, I can't look away.

313
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:55,319
味見して
Have a taste.

314
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:58,819
君の毒は私の薬って
Your poison is my medicine,

315
00:29:58,819 --> 00:30:00,019
包んであげた
I wrapped it up for you.

316
00:30:08,314 --> 00:30:12,314
愛帯 逢いたい 逢いたい その笑顔に
I want to see, I want to see, I want to see that smile.

317
00:30:12,564 --> 00:30:18,064
愛帯 逢いたい 逢いたいと言えば 笑ってくれるかな
If I say I want to see you, I wonder if you'll smile for me.

318
00:30:18,614 --> 00:30:23,064
取り殺させるくらいはいいじゃない
Being haunted to death sounds fine, doesn't it?

319
00:30:23,464 --> 00:30:27,964
欲を言えばこの手で咲かせてみせたい
If I'm being greedy, I want to make it bloom with these hands.

320
00:30:28,264 --> 00:30:30,364
病のように
Like a sickness.

321
00:30:31,364 --> 00:30:35,764
心は喰らう花
The heart is a devouring flower.

322
00:30:36,164 --> 00:30:40,364
枯らしたないのさ
I don't want to let it wither.

323
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:45,764
光が届かずとも
Even if the light doesn't reach,

324
00:30:46,264 --> 00:30:50,564
水をあげ続けるから
I'll keep giving it water.

325
00:30:53,164 --> 00:30:56,464
いい加減に気付いて
Realize it already,

326
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:59,464
君は素敵って
that you are wonderful.

327
00:30:59,564 --> 00:31:02,764
自惚れてもっとお大事に
Be more conceited, take care of yourself.

328
00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:07,964
無自覚なまま愛を蓄えて
Accumulating love while remaining unaware,

329
00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:11,664
綺麗にされた花瓶も
even the cleaned vase,

330
00:31:11,864 --> 00:31:13,864
肥やしもなにもいらない
doesn't need fertilizer or anything.

331
00:31:14,064 --> 00:31:18,064
その姿で咲き誇れ
Bloom proudly in that form.

332
00:31:19,864 --> 00:31:21,864
花になって
Become a flower.

333
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:27,164
ほらニヒルに笑って その顔に
Look, laugh cynically, at that face.

334
00:31:27,564 --> 00:31:30,664
ぞくぞくして目が離せない
I'm shivering and can't look away.

335
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:35,464
味見して 君の毒は私の薬って
Taste it, your poison is my medicine.

336
00:31:35,864 --> 00:31:39,364
包んであげるから
I'll wrap you up in it.

337
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:44,664
楽にして 君の闇は私の光って
Relax, your darkness is my light.

338
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:48,464
愛してあげるから
I'll love you.

339
00:31:49,164 --> 00:31:50,464
笑って
Smile.

340
00:32:23,964 --> 00:32:26,664
多分 私じゃなくていいね
Probably, it doesn't have to be me.

341
00:32:26,964 --> 00:32:29,364
余裕のない二人だったし
We were two people with no room to spare.

342
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:35,464
気付けば喧嘩ばっかりしてさ ごめんね
Before I knew it, we were just fighting. I'm sorry.

343
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:38,764
ずっと話そうと思ってた
I've been meaning to talk for a while.

344
00:32:38,964 --> 00:32:41,664
きっと私たち合わないね
We probably just don't match.

345
00:32:41,864 --> 00:32:45,464
二人きりしかいない部屋でさ
In a room with just the two of us,

346
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:48,964
貴方ばっかり話していたよね
you were the only one talking, weren't you?

347
00:32:49,264 --> 00:32:54,564
もしいつか何処かで会えたら
If we happen to meet somewhere again someday,

348
00:32:54,964 --> 00:33:00,464
今日の事を笑ってくれるかな
I wonder if you'll laugh about today.

349
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:07,564
理由もちゃんと話せないけれど
I can't really explain the reason properly, but

350
00:33:07,864 --> 00:33:13,964
貴方が眠った後に泣くのは嫌
I hate crying after you've fallen asleep.

351
00:33:14,764 --> 00:33:21,364
声も顔も不器用なとこも
Your voice, your face, even your clumsiness,

352
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:27,364
全部全部 嫌いじゃないの
I don't hate any of it, none of it.

353
00:33:27,664 --> 00:33:31,464
ドライフラワーみたい
Like a dry flower,

354
00:33:31,764 --> 00:33:38,464
君との日々も きっときっときっときっと
my days with you will surely, surely, surely, surely...

355
00:33:38,664 --> 00:33:41,664
色褪せる
fade in color.

356
00:33:57,464 --> 00:34:00,464
多分 君じゃなくてよかった
Maybe I'm glad it wasn't you.

357
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,464
もう泣かされることもないし
I won't be made to cry anymore,

358
00:34:03,664 --> 00:34:09,564
「私ばかり」なんて言葉もなくなった
and the phrase 'It's always just me' has disappeared.

359
00:34:10,164 --> 00:34:13,864
あんなに悲しい別れでも
Even with such a sad parting,

360
00:34:14,164 --> 00:34:16,864
時間が経てば忘れてく
I'll forget it as time goes by.

361
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:22,464
新しい人と並ぶ君は
You, standing next to someone new,

362
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:25,964
ちゃんとうまくやれているのかな
I wonder if you're getting along well.

363
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,464
もう顔も
Even your face,

364
00:34:28,664 --> 00:34:30,464
見たくないからさ
I don't want to see it anymore.

365
00:34:30,664 --> 00:34:34,964
変に連絡してこないでほしい
I want you to stop contacting me unexpectedly.

366
00:34:35,464 --> 00:34:39,464
都合がいいのは変わってないんだね
You haven't changed how selfish you are, have you?

367
00:34:39,664 --> 00:34:47,464
でも無視できずにまた少し返事
But I can't ignore you, so I reply a little again.

368
00:34:48,264 --> 00:34:55,064
声も顔も不器用なとこも
Your voice, your face, even your clumsiness,

369
00:34:55,264 --> 00:34:59,464
多分 今も 嫌いじゃないの
Maybe, even now, I don't hate them.

370
00:35:03,258 --> 00:35:03,958
…いた
…was holding on

371
00:35:05,158 --> 00:35:07,058
時間が経てば
As time passes

372
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:08,458
きっと
Surely

373
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:09,458
きっと
Surely

374
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,458
きっと
Surely

375
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:11,958
きっと
Surely

376
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:15,758
色褪せる
It will fade away

377
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:31,758
月灯りに魔物が揺れる
Demons sway in the moonlight

378
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:34,958
きっと私もどうかなってる
I must be losing my mind too

379
00:35:35,158 --> 00:35:38,458
暗闇に色彩が浮かぶ
Colors float in the darkness

380
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:44,758
赤黄色の色が胸の奥
Red and yellow colors deep within my chest

381
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:47,958
ずっと貴方の名前を呼ぶ
I keep calling your name forever

382
00:35:48,158 --> 00:35:53,458
好きという気持ちまた香る
The feeling of love becomes fragrant again

383
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,958
声も
Your voice

384
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:57,458
顔も
Your face

385
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:00,458
不器用なとこも
Even your clumsiness

386
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,958
全部
All of it

387
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:03,458
全部
All of it

388
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:06,458
大嫌いだよ
I hate it so much

389
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:09,958
まだ枯れない花を
A flower that hasn't withered yet

390
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:13,458
君に添えてさ
Placing it by your side

391
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:14,958
ずっと
Forever

392
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:15,958
ずっと
Forever

393
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:16,958
ずっと
Forever

394
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:17,958
ずっと
Forever

395
00:36:18,158 --> 00:36:22,958
抱えてよ
Hold onto it

396
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:22,458
「大丈夫」と
Saying "I'm fine"

397
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:28,458
また嘘をついた
You lied again

398
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:33,958
無理してるの
You're pushing yourself

399
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,958
声でわかるよ
I can tell by your voice

400
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:40,458
バレてるんだよ
I already know

401
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:53,458
ダメなとこ
Your flaws

402
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:54,958
性格だって
Your personality too

403
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:56,458
違う貴方
You are different

404
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:58,958
だけど似てる
But we're similar

405
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:00,458
とこも意外と
in surprising ways

406
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:01,958
あって
we have them

407
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:04,458
共鳴
Resonance

408
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:06,458
すぐにしだんだ
It happened immediately

409
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:07,958
惹かれ
Drawn

410
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:10,458
合った私たち
to each other

411
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,458
不思議な
It's mysterious

412
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,458
この絆
this bond

413
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,458
なんだか照れなくて
Somehow I'm not shy about it

414
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:17,958
夢を語り明かそう
Let's talk about dreams

415
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:18,958
朝まで
until morning

416
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:22,958
私がね頑張れる理由
The reason I can do my best

417
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:23,958
そう
Yes

418
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:26,958
一人じゃないから
because I'm not alone

419
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:30,958
貴方が笑えば
If you smile

420
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:34,958
私もつられる
I smile too

421
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:38,958
隣合わせの心
Our hearts side-by-side

422
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:41,958
連鎖してるよ
are connected

423
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:45,958
時には歩幅が
Sometimes our pace

424
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:47,958
ズレてしまうけど
might be out of sync, but

425
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:48,958
二人
the two of us

426
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:50,958
呼吸揃えさ
will synchronize our breathing

427
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:52,958
未来へと
Towards the future

428
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:56,958
進んでいこう
let's move forward

429
00:38:56,958 --> 00:39:00,958
どれくらいの時間かな
How much time has passed?

430
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:02,958
周りと比べて
Comparing with those around me

431
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:06,958
果てしないトラック戦と
With this endless track race

432
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:08,958
追いつけるの
can I catch up?

433
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,958
なんて弱気な日も
Even on such weak days

434
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:14,958
激励し続けてくれた
you kept encouraging me

435
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:19,958
貴方にいつも感謝
Always grateful to you

436
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,958
転んでも立ち上がる
Even if I fall, I'll stand up

437
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:22,958
いつでも
Always

438
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:24,958
夢を叶えたいんだ
I want to make my dreams come true

439
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:25,958
必ず
Definitely

440
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:29,958
こんなにね打ち込めるのは
The reason I can be this absorbed

441
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:32,958
そう仲間がいるから
Yes, is because I have friends

442
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:37,958
貴方の悩みは
As for your worries

443
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:41,958
私が寄り添う
I will stay close to them

444
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:45,958
心が疲れたなら
If your heart gets tired

445
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:47,958
休憩しよう
let's take a break

446
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:50,958
遠慮はしないで
Don't hold back

447
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:52,958
そんな仲じゃない
we're not strangers

448
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:53,958
二人
The two of us

449
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:57,958
肩を組んでほら
look, with arms around each other

450
00:39:57,958 --> 00:40:00,958
何度でも乗り越える
we'll overcome it again and again

451
00:40:03,664 --> 00:40:08,764
世界中が敵になっても
Even if the whole world turns against me,

452
00:40:09,864 --> 00:40:14,564
変わらずあなたの味方
I'll always be on your side.

453
00:40:15,464 --> 00:40:16,064
右と
Right and

454
00:40:16,364 --> 00:40:17,564
左
Left,

455
00:40:17,864 --> 00:40:21,264
友達の証だよって
Proof that we are friends.

456
00:40:22,264 --> 00:40:24,264
強く固く
Strongly, tightly,

457
00:40:24,664 --> 00:40:27,764
縛ったリボン
The ribbon we tied.

458
00:40:29,164 --> 00:40:31,464
話題のドラマも
The trending dramas,

459
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:34,764
虹の出る空も
The sky with a rainbow,

460
00:40:35,664 --> 00:40:38,464
掴み取る栄光も
And the glory we'll grasp,

461
00:40:39,164 --> 00:40:41,264
一緒に見たい
I want to see them all together.

462
00:40:42,464 --> 00:40:44,464
あなたが笑えば
If you smile,

463
00:40:45,264 --> 00:40:47,564
私もつられる
I can't help but smile too.

464
00:40:48,564 --> 00:40:51,264

いやもう...完全に忘れてた！
No, well... I totally forgot it!

509
00:43:00,864 --> 00:43:05,364
でも分かる。いろんなのをやってくとね、こうね、忘れちゃうから。
But I get it. When you do so many things, you just forget.

しかも2年ぶりだし。
Plus it's been two years.

そう、忘れちゃったけど...
Yeah, I forgot it but...

00:43:08,464 --> 00:43:10,764
前はさ、シークレットゲストだったじゃん。
Before, I was a secret guest, right.

00:58:27,586 --> 00:58:30,886
黙ってしまうほどの恐怖はない
There is no fear enough to silence me.

784
00:58:30,886 --> 00:58:33,286
使い捨てるみたいに
Like throwing something away,

785
00:58:33,286 --> 00:58:35,186
手を離したあなたに
to you who let go of my hand.

786
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,586
昨日とはまるで違う
It's completely different from yesterday.

787
00:58:37,586 --> 00:58:39,786
わかったところでしょうがない
Even if I understood, it wouldn't help.

788
00:58:39,886 --> 00:58:42,186
変わっていく身体と
My changing body,

789
00:58:42,586 --> 00:58:44,786
心の中で響くVoice
and the Voice echoing in my heart.

790
00:58:44,886 --> 00:58:46,886
間違ってなかったと
That I wasn't wrong...

791
00:58:47,186 --> 00:58:49,686
ただこの空を眺めて
...I just gaze at this sky.

792
00:58:51,186 --> 00:58:53,386
I still 重なってくたび
I still, every time they overlap,

793
00:58:53,886 --> 00:58:56,386
思い出してしまうのに
I end up remembering it all.

794
00:58:56,886 --> 00:58:59,186
誤魔化してしまうのは
The reason I try to hide it is...

795
00:58:59,586 --> 00:59:01,986
確かにあった後悔から
...because of the regret that was certainly there.

796
00:59:02,086 --> 00:59:04,286
誓ったはずなんだ
I should have sworn it.

797
00:59:04,486 --> 00:59:06,886
さよならすらシルベにしよう
Let's turn even goodbyes into a signpost.

798
00:59:06,986 --> 00:59:09,986
光に触れる度 願ってしまうように
Just like how I wish every time I touch the light.

799
00:59:10,386 --> 00:59:13,086
And still I rise

800
00:59:14,286 --> 00:59:16,186
染まっていく
Being dyed in color.

801
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,586
必要もない
There's no need.

802
00:59:22,386 --> 00:59:23,786
越えられないborder
A border that cannot be crossed.

803
00:59:23,786 --> 00:59:25,386
揺れる意志をconvert
Convert the wavering will.

804
00:59:26,386 --> 00:59:28,386
嘘で染めるような日々じゃ
In days colored by lies,

805
00:59:28,386 --> 00:59:30,686
振り返った時にはheartache
there's only heartache when looking back.

806
00:59:31,586 --> 00:59:32,886
まだ夜が明けるWake up
The dawn is breaking again, Wake up.

807
00:59:32,886 --> 00:59:34,586
夢の中のflavor
The flavor inside a dream.

808
00:59:35,586 --> 00:59:38,886
誰もいなくなった道を歩いてる
Walking down a road where everyone has gone.

809
00:59:38,886 --> 00:59:40,786
今の私に
To the current me,

810
00:59:41,386 --> 00:59:42,586
迷いすら重ねてくる
even hesitation piles up.

811
00:59:42,586 --> 00:59:44,386
おとぎ話の正体
The true nature of the fairy tale.

812
00:59:44,786 --> 00:59:49,186
誤魔化しきれなかった心が纏う熱を
The heat worn by a heart that couldn't be fully hidden,

813
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:52,386
憧れが照らしてる
is illuminated by longing.

814
00:59:52,486 --> 00:59:54,486
I still 重なってくたび
I still, every time they overlap,

815
00:59:55,186 --> 00:59:57,386
思い出してしまうのに
I end up remembering it all.

816
00:59:57,386 --> 00:59:59,586
誤魔化してしまうのは
The reason I try to hide it is...

817
01:00:00,086 --> 01:00:03,486
大人になった後悔から
...because of the regret of becoming an adult.

818
01:00:03,103 --> 01:00:04,903
月明かりの夜は
On moonlit nights,

819
01:00:05,203 --> 01:00:07,403
さよならすらシルベにしよう
let's make even 'goodbye' a guidepost.

820
01:00:07,603 --> 01:00:09,903
光を繋ぐたび
Each time we connect the light,

821
01:00:09,903 --> 01:00:11,603
浮かぶ星座のように
like constellations floating above,

822
01:00:12,103 --> 01:00:14,803
選んできた道のりを今を
the path we chose, and this moment...

823
01:00:15,003 --> 01:00:18,403
いずれ後悔してしまう時が来ても
even if a time comes when we regret it,

824
01:00:19,303 --> 01:00:21,503
私はまだ止まらない
I still won't stop.

825
01:00:22,003 --> 01:00:24,203
夜空に浮かぶ月の光を
The moonlight floating in the night sky,

826
01:00:24,303 --> 01:00:26,403
見上げた空に散らばる星の
the star's...

827
01:00:26,503 --> 01:00:28,003
宝石を
...jewels scattered in the sky we looked up at.

828
01:00:30,203 --> 01:00:32,303
道標にして
Making them my guidepost,

829
01:00:32,403 --> 01:00:34,903
帰る場所
a place to return to.

830
01:00:37,403 --> 01:00:39,003
重なってくたび
Every time they overlap,

831
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:41,603
思い出してしまうのに
I end up remembering,

832
01:00:42,103 --> 01:00:44,303
誤魔化してしまうのは
yet what I try to gloss over is...

833
01:00:44,503 --> 01:00:46,703
確かにあった後悔から
...because of the regret that certainly existed,

834
01:00:47,803 --> 01:00:49,803
誓ったはずなんだ
I should have sworn.

835
01:00:50,503 --> 01:00:52,503
さよならすらシルベにしよう
Let's make even 'goodbye' a guidepost.

836
01:00:52,603 --> 01:00:56,103
光に触れるたび願ってしまうように
Just as I wish every time I touch the light.

837
01:00:56,503 --> 01:00:59,703
And still I rise!!

838
01:01:00,703 --> 01:01:02,603
染まってく必要もない
There's no need to be dyed by it.

839
01:01:02,703 --> 01:01:05,103
どれも哀を模して
Imitating sorrow in everything,

840
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,003
true

841
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:22,603
はい ということで
Okay, so...

842
01:01:22,603 --> 01:01:27,703

The Activity 6th Anniversary Full Set looks like this.

894
01:04:03,503 --> 01:04:05,403
では細かく見ていきましょう
So let's look in detail.

895
01:04:05,403 --> 01:04:06,703
まず1つ目はこちら
First is this.

896
01:04:07,603 --> 01:04:10,203
「Towavelしてね」アクリルジオラマスタンド
'Towavel with me' Acrylic Diorama Stand.

897
01:04:11,003 --> 01:04:13,403
イラストは大熊まい先生に描いていただきました
The illustration was drawn by Ookuma Mai-sensei.

898
01:04:15,603 --> 01:04:18,003
ちょっとね 大人っぽいトワちゃんと一緒に
I hope you can go on a sort of date...

899
01:04:18,003 --> 01:04:20,103
あのデート的なのいってもらえればなと思います
...with a slightly mature Towa-chan.

900
01:04:24,503 --> 01:04:26,503
いつもね Towavelみんなしてくれて
Thank you everyone...

901
01:04:26,503 --> 01:04:27,503
ありがとうございます
...for always doing Towavel.

902
01:04:27,503 --> 01:04:29,503
これね あの本体をね
This, you know, you take out the main body...

903
01:04:29,503 --> 01:04:30,603
こう取り出して
...like this...

904
01:04:30,603 --> 01:04:32,403
ま 本体ってトワのことなんだけど
(Well, main body means Towa though)

905
01:04:32,603 --> 01:04:34,903
トワを取り出して一緒にね
Take Towa out, and since I made the pose...

906
01:04:34,903 --> 01:04:36,503
写真が撮れるポージングにしてるので
...so you can take photos together,

907
01:04:38,503 --> 01:04:40,703
ぜひ一緒にね Towavelしてポストしてみてね
please definitely Towavel together and try posting it.

908
01:04:41,603 --> 01:04:43,303
はい では次はこちら
Okay, next is this.

909
01:04:43,503 --> 01:04:45,003
「トワとお揃い！？ジャージ」
'Matching Jersey with Towa!?'

910
01:04:46,703 --> 01:04:49,803
トワのね 通常衣装の服をイメージした
It's a jersey imaging Towa's regular outfit clothes.

911
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:50,803
ジャージとなっております
It's become a jersey.

912
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:56,103
これね あのトワと全く一緒にすると
If I made this exactly the same as Towa's,

913
01:04:56,103 --> 01:04:58,503
とんでもない露出度になるので
it would be an outrageous level of exposure, so...

914
01:05:00,803 --> 01:05:02,103
長めの着やすい
Longer, easy to wear...

915
01:05:04,362 --> 01:05:08,262
伝えております。
...conveying that.

916
01:05:08,462 --> 01:05:09,462
よかったー。
Thank goodness.

917
01:05:09,662 --> 01:05:14,262
ちゃんと裏地もね、ネオンピンクみたいな形の...
The lining is also properly, like a neon pink shape...

918
01:05:14,262 --> 01:05:17,062
形じゃないね、ネオンピンク色になってますから
Not shape, it's a neon pink color.

919
01:05:17,262 --> 01:05:21,962
本当にトワ様を、になっちゃったみたいなジャージになってます。
It's a jersey where you can really embody Towa-sama.

920
01:05:22,162 --> 01:05:27,062
ちょっと大きめのサイズなんで、みんな着やすいのかなと思います。
Since the size is a bit large, I think it'll be easy for everyone to wear.

921
01:05:27,262 --> 01:05:29,162
はい、ということで、じゃあ最後3つ目。
Okay, so, the last third item.

922
01:05:29,362 --> 01:05:32,062
ビビハンドストラップ！
Bibi Hand Strap!

923
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:37,762
やっぱね、結構あのトワのジャージとかは、
You know, Towa's jersey and such are quite...

924
01:05:37,762 --> 01:05:43,262
結構あの「The Goods」というかさ、キャラグッズみたいな感じするんですけれども
...well, very 'The Goods,' or feel like character goods, but...

925
01:05:43,462 --> 01:05:47,362
通常使いもね、しやすいような...
I thought I wanted goods that are easy to use daily...

926
01:05:47,362 --> 01:05:50,962
使い勝手の良いような、グッズも欲しいなと思いまして
...and practical to use, so...

927
01:05:51,162 --> 01:05:53,362
ハンドストラップを作ってみました。
I tried making a hand strap.

928
01:05:53,562 --> 01:05:55,162
イェイ。
Yay.

929
01:05:55,362 --> 01:05:58,362
えー、カラーリングもね、すごい落ち着いていて
The coloring is also very calm...

930
01:05:58,362 --> 01:06:02,662
トワっぽい色になったんじゃないかなと思うので、ぜひ購入お願いいたします。
...and I think it became a Towa-like color, so please buy it.

931
01:06:02,862 --> 01:06:07,762
えーこちら、スマートフォンの画像はついておりますが、スマートフォンはついてきませんので
Uh, here, the image of the smartphone is attached, but the smartphone is not included...

932
01:06:07,762 --> 01:06:09,762
よろしくお願いいたします。
...so please understand.

933
01:06:09,962 --> 01:06:11,862
よろしくおねがいします（笑）
