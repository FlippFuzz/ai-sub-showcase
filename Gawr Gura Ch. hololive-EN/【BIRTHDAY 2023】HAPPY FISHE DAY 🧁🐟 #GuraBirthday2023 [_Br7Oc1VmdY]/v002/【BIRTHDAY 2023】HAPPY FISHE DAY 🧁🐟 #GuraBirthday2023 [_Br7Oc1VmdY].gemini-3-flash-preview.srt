00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:24,782
Hi.

3
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:27,765
Aha! Aha, I thought...

4
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:29,740
...I thought I was going to burp,

5
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,060
and then I thought,

6
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,243
imagine if the first thing I say when I'm here...

7
00:03:33,243 --> 00:03:35,341
...is just a burp.

8
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:36,782
That would have been quite...

9
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,455
...that would have been something.

10
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:40,403
Anyway, hi! Hi!

11
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:43,085
Hi!

12
00:03:48,384 --> 00:03:49,006
Hi.

13
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,300
I was... can you hear me over this...

14
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,204
...jazz band? Let me calm down...

15
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:57,170
...let me calm down the brass real quick.

16
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,672
Oh, is it fine? You hear me.

17
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:02,138
Ah! Hello!

18
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:04,428
It's my birthday today!

19
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:06,634
What was I going to say?

20
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:08,579
Oh, I was going to say,

21
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:11,234
I was so nervous before the start of the stream.

22
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:13,581
I was just saying "Ah" into my microphone like that,

23
00:04:13,581 --> 00:04:15,823
but like really quietly and like sensually.

24
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,423
Well, not sensually, I was just saying it quietly.

25
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:21,082
And I was listening to my heartbeat so loud and so hard.

26
00:04:21,082 --> 00:04:23,738
You can hear it. I can like hear it in my throat.

27
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:34,120
That's kind of gross, isn't it?

28
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,388
Ew, did you know there's a skeleton inside you right now?

29
00:04:37,388 --> 00:04:40,674
And next to the skeleton, there's like hearts and stuff.

30
00:04:40,674 --> 00:04:43,210
Did you know there's like squishy pieces inside of you?

31
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,443
There's a skeleton living inside you,

32
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:48,302
and he has a collection of other squishy things. Ew.

33
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,185
I'm also incredibly fidgety today because I'm so nervous.

34
00:04:58,185 --> 00:04:59,883
Anyway, today's my birthday.

35
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:01,243
What was it?

36
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:03,213
Happy birthday to me.

37
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:07,453
I'm 9,303.

38
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:13,043
I look like a baby...

39
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:14,883
...um, but I...

40
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:20,153
...I can't rhyme with "E".

41
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:27,583
Dooba-dooba-doom. Ah.

42
00:05:27,783 --> 00:05:30,183
Okay, just making sure. Is this pre-recorded? No.

43
00:05:30,283 --> 00:05:32,383
Sucks to suck.

44
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:34,283
I'm sorry, I can't say that.

45
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:36,483
I can't be... I can't be...

46
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:41,483
...I can't be like that already. I'm sorry if I'm a bit on the...

47
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,283
...um, I'm gonna bite you.

48
00:05:44,383 --> 00:05:47,283
Don't say anything mean to me. It's my birthday.

49
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:50,183
Do you see this face? When you're bullying me...

50
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,483
...this is the face you're bullying. Do you see this?

51
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,283
How could you? How could you?

52
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:58,183
This is what you're being mean to.

53
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:02,983
I can't bully the birthday girl. It's not fair.

54
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:07,383
Or is it that you can only bully someone on their birthday?

55
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:14,983
Or... Well, technically bullying, I guess, is... it hits a bit harder when it's your birthday.

56
00:06:15,883 --> 00:06:19,483
Oh my goodness, do we have stuff to do!

57
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,983
Do I have this... not the brain for it.

58
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:26,483
So much to do, so little brain space. So little brain activity.

59
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:31,183
I can't hear over the jazz band, but you guys seem to be okay with it.

60
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:34,483
I just want to say thank you guys for coming.

61
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:39,083
Thank you for being here. Thank you for all of my birthday wishes that I saw on Twitter.

62
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:45,283
And all of you here saying "Happy Birthday". Thank you so much.

63
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:47,183
Alright, chill out, jazz.

64
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:53,083
Thank you guys. I really do appreciate it.

65
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,983
It makes me feel very warm and fuzzy.

66
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,283
I was having a chat with...

67
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:05,183
...uh, Staff-san, Ma-Man-san, management...

68
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:11,183
...and I was talking about how... how easy it is for me to cry, especially on my birthday.

69
00:07:11,283 --> 00:07:15,183
I was like, "Oh boy". Because they came to me and they were like, "Girl, you know..."

70
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:22,483
...we got a... we got a gift for you from quite a few EBIs."

71
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,183
And I said, "Oh no. Is this..."

72
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:30,283
...is this going to be my... my big cry?"

73
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:37,383
"My big unconsol- unconsolable... my big unconsolable cry session on stream?"

74
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:40,483
It's like almost every year I have at least one.

75
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:45,483
At least one big cry-fest because I'm a big baby.

76
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:50,483
I'm a big cry baby. And that's okay. That's A-OK.

77
00:07:55,583 --> 00:08:00,083
Oh my god, I forgot to tell you about my birthday cake!

78
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:05,083
So, my birthday cake... can you guess what kind of cake it is? Hmm?

79
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:08,583
I got a... don't guess, I'm gonna tell you.

80
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:12,483
I got a strawberry cake. It's got like whipped cream and strawberries.

81
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,183
Did you guess? Yeah, strawberries.

82
00:08:15,283 --> 00:08:19,483
My favorite. My favorite. I could eat my weight in strawberries in like two hours.

83
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:23,483
Give me two hours and I'll eat an entire thing of strawberries.

84
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:28,383
Yeah. Also, do you see your little... do you see this? The little emojis on the side?

85
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:33,183
I can see all your emojis. So if all you guys put in the poopoo emoji...

86
00:08:33,283 --> 00:08:36,483
...it would just be a stream of poopoo.

87
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:42,483
But I'm seeing a lot of... what do I see? Hearts, hundred... likes stuff.

88
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:47,283
I don't think the custom emojis go through though.

89
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:52,483
But yeah, hello! Thank you! Thank you for the hellos and the happy birthdays.

90
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,483
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

91
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,483
Ah, one year older. Isn't that weird to think about?

92
00:09:04,283 --> 00:09:11,383
See, the problem around my birthday is I start to do a little too much deep think... and next thing you know I'm spiraling.

93
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:17,283
Like, "Oh! I'm birthday!" And then you think about the planet, and then the spinning of the planet...

94
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:22,483
...and then all of the planets... and then I start thinking about UFOs.

95
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:30,183
And then I freaked myself out really bad and I had to go to bed.

96
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:34,483
You ever do that? Don't let the brain run too fast.

97
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:42,483
Because sometimes it runs down really scary places. UFO!

98
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,483
Oh boy, what do we have planned for today?

99
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:52,183
I guess we could... we could take a peek at the birthday gift that a big group of you worked on for me.

100
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:55,983
I won't cry, I promise I won't cry. Pinky promise.

101
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,083
And then afterwards, I have some gifts for you.

102
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:01,345
...is, uh...

103
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:04,145
It's like, think of it like a goody bag.

104
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,245
Do you guys remember getting goody bags

105
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:07,445
when you went to birthday—

106
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:10,545
Oh wait! Oh my god, I forgot to tell you about that.

107
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:11,845
Do you remember...

108
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,545
Do you remember when you were a little babby

109
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:18,545
and you would get catalogs in the mail,

110
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:22,045
and they would have themed character
birthday party packs?

111
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:25,545
I was looking—I was looking them up
because I really wanted to do one.

112
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:28,045
Don't judge me, but I really wanted to do one.

113
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,545
And I was thinking like,
"Oh, kids these days, I bet you see like..."

114
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:33,545
"...uh, you probably still see like princesses
and like Barbie..."

115
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:36,545
"...and like Hot Wheels." And I was thinking,
"Oh, Bluey and stuff like that."

116
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:40,545
And you know what? They still have them!

117
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:43,545
I didn't do it this year,
but maybe next year...

118
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:46,045
...I'll throw myself a Bluey birthday party.

119
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,545
Bluey the dog. Yeah.

120
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:52,545
Because I can. And that's the magic of it.

121
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:56,045
So if you want to do that for your birthday,
I think you should do it.

122
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:58,545
You should get a piñata too, and beat it up.

123
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:02,045
All's I'm sayin'. Oh! Oh yeah, remindin' me.

124
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:05,545
Because yours used to do like goody bags
when you went to birthday parties...

125
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:08,545
...like in school and stuff. That was like the best part.

126
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:11,845
Is you go to the birthday party, and you give a gift,

127
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:15,545
but then you get the goody bag at the end
that's got like a tattoo and a slap bracelet.

128
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:19,045
So think of my gift to you as your...

129
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,045
...goody bag.

130
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:23,545
Yeah.

131
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:27,545
Also, I always for—I like—I keep forgetting
that I have to let myself breathe,

132
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:31,545
but I don't like the silence of when I'm breathing.
It makes me wildly uncomfortable.

133
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:36,545
But if I don't swallow and I don't breathe,
then I won't be able to talk anymore.

134
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:40,545
Somebody—somebody flick me in the forehead
and tell me, "That's—just don't do that. Just breathe."

135
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:46,045
Ah! A Gura bag? A Goo—a Goobi bag?

136
00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:49,045
I put my goo in it.

137
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:51,545
Hmm.

138
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,045
Tasty, I guess.

139
00:11:56,545 --> 00:11:59,545
Tasty, I think. Uh, okay!

140
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:04,545
So a gift to me from a very large group
of you is...

141
00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:08,545
...here, I have it here. We're gonna take a—
we're gonna take a walk through it.

142
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:13,545
It is nearly 200 pages, from what I can see.

143
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:18,545
I don't think we have time to go through
all 200 pages, but...

144
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:26,545
It's—it's called "Nyuman Around the World:
Wish You Were Here".

145
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:30,545
And these look like all postcards.
Can you see my cursor? No. Okay.

146
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:34,545
Oh, sorry by the way, I had to cover you guys up.
I apologize.

147
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,545
So I want to see what this is.

148
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:42,545
I went this far because it told me how to view it.
Thank you very much.

149
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,545
This is actually really helpful. So...

150
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:50,545
"Hello, Hola, Bonjour, Guten Tag, Ciao,
Konnichiwa, Ni Hao, and Howdy Gura!"

151
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:54,545
"Chumbuds from all around the world braved
the most difficult challenge just for you."

152
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:56,545
"They touched grass!"

153
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:58,545
Wow!

154
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,045
Did you bring me back any? Mmm, grass.

155
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:07,545
"It was no easy feat, but with a little Gura
by their side, they gathered the courage..."

156
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:09,345
"...to make this one-of-a-kind book."

157
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:12,445
A group of dedicated Ebis were able to take

158
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:14,945
the valiant efforts of your international

159
00:13:14,945 --> 00:13:17,445
community and make this travel journal

160
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:19,445
be filled with breathtaking scenery,

161
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:21,445
interesting attraction spots,

162
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:23,045
and silly Goomba sightings.

163
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:24,545
I'm very excited.

164
00:13:24,545 --> 00:13:27,545
"We hope we can give you the feeling as if
you actually traveled to these places..."

165
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:32,545
"...perhaps even give you motivation and ideas
for your next trip. Let's enjoy this world..."

166
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:36,545
"...together, the GG team."
Travel journal and message screeners...

167
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:40,545
...by Zanme, Pommes, Afree, and Remu.
Communication and translation...

168
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:44,545

Hi guys! Our graphic design, book logo...

169
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:48,545
...is by Shskr. Front and back covers by Advvcr.

170
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:52,045
This is pretty cool.

171
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:54,045
North America.

172
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:56,545
Is it like postcards? Gosh!

173
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,545
Artwork based on Lake Louise.
Louise? Or is that a V?

174
00:14:00,545 --> 00:14:04,545
See, the problem is now is you're gonna really
get to see how much I can't read.

175
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:10,545
It's cute, it's based on a real lake in Canada.
Right, that was Canada.

176
00:14:11,545 --> 00:14:12,545
Okay, okay.

177
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:16,545
By the way, I'm very worldly.

178
00:14:17,545 --> 00:14:21,545
"New York, New York, submitted by Marcinie."
Oh please tell me I said that name right.

179
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:23,545
Marcinie? So did you guys like—wait.

180
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:27,545
Calgary—Oh my god!

181
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:31,545
Okay wait, we're gonna read a couple pages.

182
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:37,545
"Nendo Gura and the view from the tallest
building in the United States." It was the—

183
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,545
Oh, excuse me, "It was the third time I ever
came back to NYC..."

184
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:43,045
"...but it will never lose its magic."

185
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:03,057
I like heights and tall buildings, so for me the number one thing is to go...

186
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:09,157
...to all the observatory decks to the public and taking pictures of the breathtaking skyline.

187
00:15:09,157 --> 00:15:11,457
I've been here! This big pointy building, I've been here!

188
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:14,557
Yeah, I wanted to use the bathroom at the top, tippy-tippy top...

189
00:15:14,557 --> 00:15:21,057
...because then I could say that I went to the bathroom in the world's tallest building.

190
00:15:21,057 --> 00:15:25,057
Which is not something that... current me... past me thought that was really funny...

191
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:33,257
...but current me thinks that's not exactly something... that's not a topic you bring to the dinner table.

192
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:37,057
Uh... so I didn't actually do it, so I can't actually even say that I... haha!

193
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:41,157
I, I... did you know? Did you know that I...

194
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:46,557
I... anyway...

195
00:15:46,557 --> 00:15:54,057
The variety of different kinds of museums is fascinating and one of my favorites is the American Museum of Natural History where I took photos with those sharks.

196
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:57,257
OMG NYC!

197
00:15:57,257 --> 00:16:06,057
I've not been... I don't think I've been to the Museum of Natural History.

198
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:12,457
I don't think I'm a very good museum-goer. I get really bored...

199
00:16:12,457 --> 00:16:18,057
...really easily, which is really bad.

200
00:16:18,057 --> 00:16:23,057
I need to go to like... like museums for children because they have all the stuff you can touch.

201
00:16:23,057 --> 00:16:29,057
If a museum has touchy stuff then I'm fine, but if it's just a bunch of little placards...

202
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:34,057
...I probably wouldn't be okay. I'd be a little itchy.

203
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:38,057
Do I touch grass often? No. No.

204
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:40,557
It's good for you though.

205
00:16:40,557 --> 00:16:46,557
So from Calgary, Alberta, which is Canada, did you know that? By Kilderan.

206
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:52,057
I'm so sorry, the text hurts my eyeballs, I can't really see... uh...

207
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:57,057
Hey Goob, allow me to introduce Fish Creek Provincial Park in Calgary, Alberta, Canada...

208
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:04,057
...one of the largest urban parks in North America, America!

209
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:14,057
I feel like... I feel like I'm being chosen to popcorn read but in school, and I'm really bad at reading in front of the class.

210
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:22,057
Um, it stretches 12 miles east to west coast, across the city and covers an area of around 5.2 square miles.

211
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:30,057
I can't visualize that. Can you give me that in... uh... how many hot dog... how many Fenway Franks is that?

212
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:36,557
How many hot dogs is that?

213
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:46,557
The park contains 62 miles of trails for walking, hiking, biking, picnic areas, fishing spots, and even an artificial lake for swimming.

214
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:52,057
Do you mean like a man-made lake? Because calling it artificial makes it sound... it makes it sound like a swimming pool.

215
00:17:52,057 --> 00:18:00,057
Technically a swimming pool is an artificial... it's an artificial body of water. Alright, touché.

216
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:08,557
Much of the park is forested and is home to a wide variety of wildlife including at least one pack of ravenous wild Dino Gura.

217
00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:13,057
Be cautious, especially during mating season.

218
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:24,057
I hear they are very unsafe. Um... beware ravenous packs of Dino Gura. Look at these terrifying beasties.

219
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:33,057
Don't want to get cornered by a bunch of these. They're not particularly good at stalking, but they are very cute.

220
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:42,557
And can convince victims to part with their food. Yes. Don't let them near your ankles.

221
00:18:42,557 --> 00:18:48,057
Orlando, Flor... Wait, is there chapters in this? Holy moly.

222
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:55,557
Orlando, Florida and Rosarito, Mexico. Pokifan went to Orlando, Florida.

223
00:18:55,557 --> 00:19:00,057
I knew Gura liked Disney a lot. Uh, yeah.

224
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:06,557
So I had to take her with me on a trip to Disney. Well, almost. It's not quite Disney, but Disney Springs of Orlando instead.

225
00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:17,057
We came with a group of friends for a Pokémon Go event and had lots of fun catching Pokémon, eating tasty sweet treats, finding sea monsters, and seeing a fight between a dragon and a knight.

226
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:23,057
In Disney? They got medieval fights in Disney? Medieval joust fights in Disney?

227
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:33,057
Gura also tried to eat some of the fish at the Rainforest Cafe, saying 'Just one tiny bite, please' with a cute face...

228
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:38,557
...as well as meeting some of her dino ancestors at T-Rex Cafe.

229
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:47,057
Man, that is so cool that you actually brought Dino Gura to all these places, or your Nendoroid.

230
00:19:47,057 --> 00:20:00,057
Pokifan! Also, I didn't know people still played Pokémon Go. I thought that was done, did, and no longer done in 20... what was that? 20...

231
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,869
...teen or something, but then again,

232
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,469
when I was in Japan,

233
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,469
I went to this place,

234
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:06,969
I don't remember who I was with,

235
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:08,369
I think I was with Ame.

236
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:10,269
But we went to this place... was it Ina?

237
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:11,769
It might have been Ina.

238
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:13,169
I don't remember.

239
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:14,869
I don't remember, but they had like

240
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:16,869
the life-size Pokemon GO trainers

241
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:19,269
in this really brightly lit room. It hurt my eyes,

242
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:21,869
but it felt like I was transported to another place.

243
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:23,769
It was pretty cool.

244
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:25,269
It was pretty cool.

245
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:28,169
And then Esteban went to Rosarito, Mexico.

246
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:31,269
Puerto Nuevo is a fishing village

247
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:33,369
right next to the beach in Rosarito.

248
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:36,269
It's famous for serving some of

249
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,969
the best fried lobster in the world.

250
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:40,469
Legends say that sometimes you can spot

251
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:41,869
a big fish at this location.

252
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:43,069
Oh yeah?

253
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:45,369
Which one? This one?

254
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:47,869
Listen, when we migrate,

255
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:49,469
we just end up in different places.

256
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:51,569
That's just what fishies do.

257
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:56,769
We went to... oh god,

258
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:58,769
Ciudad de México?

259
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:03,569
Oh my god, I wish I could pronounce these better.

260
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:06,169
Oxford, Ontario.

261
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:08,569
Wait, I see meat stick.

262
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,069
I see flowers.

263
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:13,569
Somebody's going to be tortured medievally.

264
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:15,569
M... M... Maine.

265
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:17,369
Minnesota.

266
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:23,069
Massachusetts.

267
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:26,169
Oh god, Dino sighting on the east coast.

268
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:27,769
South Carolina.

269
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:31,069
The Goobs! In Tennessee. Are you kidding me?

270
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:38,269
There's literally a place called The Goobs.

271
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:40,669
I'm getting sidetracked. I've gotta keep going, but

272
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:43,569
I love this. Thank you guys so much.

273
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:48,569
Alberta, Canada. That's so pretty.

274
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:51,169
Look at the color of the water.

275
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,169
It looks like my bath after I put

276
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:54,669
a bath bomb in it.

277
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:57,369
It's so blue. Lake Astor?

278
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:00,069
Is it Astor or Oster?

279
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,169
I'm stupid, don't answer that.

280
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:04,769
Baja California, Mexico.

281
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:06,869
Wait, is it Baja or Baja?

282
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:08,669
See... this is embarrassing.

283
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:10,369
New York.

284
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:12,769
La Rumorosa.

285
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:16,869
Southern Maine. Vernon.

286
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:21,069
Buffalo, New York.

287
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:23,069
Coastal...

288
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:25,069
It's the- it's the shark girl.

289
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:27,369
I've seen her on stream before.

290
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:30,069
Chihuahua, Mexico.

291
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:31,869
New Orleans.

292
00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:34,069
Oh my god.

293
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:36,869
Minnesota, Hawaii, Illinois.

294
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,869
Oh my god.

295
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:47,469
So this means that a bunch of people,

296
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:47,469
if you guys brought out your Guras

297
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,369
around other people,

298
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,669
that means that maybe like

299
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:56,469
the government started tracking all these sightings.

300
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:58,769
Imagine if they really registered me as a cryptid.

301
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:00,769
Or not me, but technically Gura.

302
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:02,569
Because people kept saying,

303
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:04,269
"Hey, what is this thing?"

304
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:06,769
"This thing we keep seeing everywhere?"

305
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:11,269
And now you're on a government watchlist.

306
00:23:19,469 --> 00:23:21,369
Pizza time!

307
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:23,069
Cute!

308
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,769
Wait, Europe?

309
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:26,569
You guys went to Europe too?

310
00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:30,369
England?

311
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:32,769
Oh, definitely government watchlist.

312
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:34,769
100%. This is amazing.

313
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:36,569
This is...

314
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,369
I feel... I feel...

315
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:46,069
I'm feeling things.

316
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:48,369
I'm getting emotional.

317
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,069
Asia, Oceania.

318
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:53,669
We have cosplay Guras!

319
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:55,369
We have Mumei. We have Muna.

320
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:59,069
We actually have Moom and Kro-id as well.

321
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:07,569
Thank you guys. This is amazing.

322
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:10,669
It's like 200 postcards

323
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:12,369
to me, from you.

324
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:20,169
Oh my god, I went to Brazil!

325
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:27,769
I literally went to Brazil

326
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:30,169
thanks to you guys.

327
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:34,569
Fishtival!

328
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:38,269
And then there's messages.

329
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,569
This is where I'm gonna cry.

330
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:45,869
Oh... this is it.

331
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:48,069
This is where I'm gonna do it.

332
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,769
I'm gonna cry.

333
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:52,569
I can't though, because we have...

334
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:57,169
Oh my god, the tractor!

335
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:59,069
Is that a John Deere?

336
00:25:01,391 --> 00:25:03,531
I didn't realize how expensive these things were.

337
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:05,231
John Deeres?

338
00:25:06,231 --> 00:25:09,231
I don't know why, I watched a tractor comparison video...

339
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:11,031
...and it was like, woah!

340
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:15,531
Is that Danny DeVito in a shark hood?

341
00:25:21,931 --> 00:25:23,131
That's amazing. Thank you guys.

342
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:25,231
This is incredible.

343
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:29,931
Every year, you guys spoil me so much. I just...

344
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:33,231
I'm very excited. I'm very excited to read all of these.

345
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,431
Thank you so much, everyone.

346
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:37,431
Thank you so many of you...

347
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:40,331
...so many of you put so much work into this. Thank you.

348
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,631
Thank you very much.

349
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:44,331
Thank you.

350
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:47,431
Thank youuu~

351
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,131
Now.

352
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:54,731
I do believe it's time for your goody bag.

353
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:56,631
If you'll have it... um...

354
00:25:57,231 --> 00:25:59,331
If you would like a goody bag, I have a goody...

355
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:02,231
...a bag of goodies for you.

356
00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:04,331
It's a goody bag of goodies for you.

357
00:26:12,931 --> 00:26:15,831
Um, so the first... I'm gonna open the goody bag for you.

358
00:26:15,831 --> 00:26:18,331
So don't worry. One...

359
00:26:18,331 --> 00:26:21,131
...the first goody in the goody bag is...

360
00:26:21,131 --> 00:26:23,931
...uh, um, where is it? There it is.

361
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:29,031
Well, here's the first one.

362
00:26:29,031 --> 00:26:30,631
Here's the first little something.

363
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:36,531
Emotes! Thank you Maerie!

364
00:26:37,231 --> 00:26:38,731
It's new emotes.

365
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,931
New emotes!

366
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:46,531
A bit of a birthday tradition, but still...

367
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:48,431
...I think it's nice.

368
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:52,331
We have some fresh new emotes from Maerie. Thank you!

369
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:56,631
Let's see what we got.

370
00:26:56,731 --> 00:27:00,131
I didn't really think the transparent background through did I? No.

371
00:27:02,231 --> 00:27:04,331
We have an unamused Ebbi.

372
00:27:04,931 --> 00:27:06,631
We have Dino Gura.

373
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:11,531
We have... looks like Elmo on fire meme.

374
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:14,531
Ebbi is on fire, but everything is fine.

375
00:27:14,531 --> 00:27:16,931
Then we have a big ol' thumbs up.

376
00:27:18,231 --> 00:27:19,931
Big ol' thumbs up.

377
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:24,531
Yeah, I think you should be able to use them... use them sooner than later.

378
00:27:25,631 --> 00:27:27,531
But yeah, we have some emotes just for you.

379
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:30,231
Where'd I put these emotes?

380
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:38,131
Okay, emotes. Um...

381
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:41,631
Oh god, I didn't... I didn't think the rest through.

382
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:47,431
Okay, I didn't really... I didn't really think this through.

383
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:53,531
Um, but I hope you like the emotes...

384
00:27:53,531 --> 00:27:56,531
...and also thank you Maerie for once again doing an amazing job with the emotes.

385
00:27:56,931 --> 00:27:58,631
I'm sorry, I'm scatterbrained.

386
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:02,231
Um, okay, the next one is the big one.

387
00:28:02,231 --> 00:28:04,731
It didn't fit in the goody bag, so I didn't really...

388
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:07,931
I don't really... um, anyway...

389
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:12,231
Um, so do you remember a long time ago...

390
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:15,631
...when I kind of in passing just...

391
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:18,631
...I mentioned like, uh...

392
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:24,531
Hey, wouldn't it be... wouldn't it be funny...

393
00:28:24,531 --> 00:28:27,631
...if I made like a animated...

394
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:30,331
...a fully animated OP...

395
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:32,731
...but for myself?

396
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:40,531
It's done!

397
00:28:41,331 --> 00:28:42,631
It's all done!

398
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:44,331
I'm freaking out! Do you want to see it?

399
00:28:45,131 --> 00:28:47,531
It's all done. I didn't animate it of course, don't get that idea.

400
00:28:48,431 --> 00:28:52,231
It was a big team project once again.

401
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,731
But hey, we did it! Woo!

402
00:28:55,431 --> 00:28:57,531
And I would like to show you now.

403
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:06,231
It's pretty much what I have to say.

404
00:29:06,231 --> 00:29:08,931
I'm very nervous... the nerves are getting worse as I go.

405
00:29:11,331 --> 00:29:14,431
But yeah, I'd like to show you that now.

406
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:20,231
Chotto matte. Chotto matte.
Wait a moment. Wait a moment.

407
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:26,431
Please hold.

408
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,131
Please hold.

409
00:29:31,331 --> 00:29:34,331
Let me prepare that for you very quickly.

410
00:29:34,931 --> 00:29:37,431
Oh, which one is it? I don't know.

411
00:29:37,431 --> 00:29:38,631
I have two here.

412
00:29:44,431 --> 00:29:47,431
Okay, I would like to present to you...

413
00:29:47,931 --> 00:29:51,631
...my very own animated anime OP!

414
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:54,531
Because why not? For you!

415
00:29:56,631 --> 00:29:58,131
Okay!

416
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:04,593
Okay, how do I... um... br-br-br-br-br-br-br-br-ah!

417
00:30:05,493 --> 00:30:07,493
Can you still hear me? Hello.

418
00:30:07,693 --> 00:30:09,193
Okay.

419
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,293
I'm nervous. Okay, enjoy.

420
00:30:18,593 --> 00:30:23,093
Always keep your eyes on the line of the horizon

421
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:26,593
Come on chumbuds climb on board and sail the brighter days

422
00:30:39,093 --> 00:30:43,093
Rain's gonna bring you down and currents pull you out, ah

423
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:46,593
Blindsided with the 404

424
00:30:46,593 --> 00:30:49,093
Try to make a splash but every streamer's crashed on you

425
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:52,593
But still we keep on spinning

426
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:55,593
Shabu shabu shabu shabu shabu shabu

427
00:30:55,593 --> 00:31:00,093
Chop 'em up, stir 'em up, slice 'em up, and cook 'em up every day

428
00:31:00,093 --> 00:31:02,593
Shabu shabu shabu shabu shabu shabu

429
00:31:02,593 --> 00:31:04,593
次まだよーよーよー
The next is yet to come...

430
00:31:04,593 --> 00:31:06,593
Shabu shabu shabu shabu shabu shabu

431
00:31:06,593 --> 00:31:09,593
It's almost time to sail the ocean

432
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:12,593
9000 years gives you a perfect armor

433
00:31:12,593 --> 00:31:14,593
With a hand to hold we're not alone

434
00:31:14,593 --> 00:31:16,593
That heart of gold will lead us home

435
00:31:16,593 --> 00:31:18,593
No one's ready, we've just begun

436
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:21,093
Hydra's setting's just more fun

437
00:31:21,093 --> 00:31:23,593
So hang on both of us across

438
00:31:23,593 --> 00:31:25,593
Help me finish the songs. Hydra setting!

439
00:31:28,593 --> 00:31:31,093
Come sail away with me

440
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:34,093
I'm set to sea, I'm at the sea

441
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:36,593
The sun will shine on our eyes

442
00:31:36,593 --> 00:31:38,593
They say dreams will carry

443
00:31:38,593 --> 00:31:42,593
So no matter how we go just always go

444
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:54,593
I'm the same Same-desu!
I'm the same shark!

445
00:32:00,093 --> 00:32:03,093
Always keep your eyes on the line of the horizon

446
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:06,593
Come on chumbuds climb on board and sail the brighter days

447
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:17,093
Aaaaah!

448
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:21,593
...eeee-ya... oh God.

449
00:32:21,593 --> 00:32:24,093
Well!

450
00:32:24,093 --> 00:32:26,593
Yay!

451
00:32:26,593 --> 00:32:30,093
Yay!

452
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:33,593
Okay, and what did we think?

453
00:32:34,093 --> 00:32:36,593
I'm shaking. I'm shaking...

454
00:32:36,593 --> 00:32:39,593
...and shaking and shaking and...

455
00:32:39,593 --> 00:32:43,093
I really quickly would like to say a big thank you...

456
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:47,093
...to the team that made that possible.

457
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:51,093
You're going to be seeing it a lot, so... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

458
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:54,593
Um, okay, so I have a photo here...

459
00:32:54,593 --> 00:32:58,593
...with all the names I would like to do a quick thank you for...

460
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:02,593
...because it would not have been possible without everybody involved here...

461
00:33:02,593 --> 00:33:04,593
...minus myself. But we have the Hololive English team.

462
00:33:04,593 --> 00:33:08,093
We have Jared, we have DuDu, 1211...

463
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:11,593
...we have Beast, we have Julius, we have Anna...

464
00:33:11,593 --> 00:33:14,593
...Why am I shaking so bad? Kyun, we have Ruan...

465
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:18,593
...we have Richtou, we have Wiki and we have Wonder.

466
00:33:18,593 --> 00:33:23,093
Uh, these are the fantastic people working with Tonari. Thank you very, very much Tonari.

467
00:33:23,593 --> 00:33:28,093
Um, I'm so happy to have been able to work with everybody at Tonari again.

468
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:32,093
I'm such a big fan of Tonari. I hope you enjoyed... I did.

469
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:36,593
Aaaah! Maybe... maybe, maybe we watch again and...

470
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:40,593
Oops, wait, hold on... we watch again...

471
00:33:40,593 --> 00:33:45,093
...and we can go frame by frame another time, 'cause there's a lot of little Easter eggs in there.

472
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:49,593
That's the thing I love about Tonari is that they are... they're Hololive fans.

473
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:54,593
So they always put a lot of little, little teeny tiny Hololive things...

474
00:33:54,593 --> 00:34:00,093
...little Easter eggs in there that you wouldn't necessarily recognize if you weren't an avid Hololive fan.

475
00:34:00,593 --> 00:34:04,093
Oh nice, we have the emotes working. That's pretty good.

476
00:34:04,093 --> 00:34:08,593
The thumb is very cute. Like for example, one of the... one of the things that caught my eye...

477
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:13,093
...was when I did the heart and the 'U' was backwards...

478
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:18,593
...from the Christmas VR Chat stream. Like something like that would have probably gone over some people's heads, but...

479
00:34:18,593 --> 00:34:22,593
...no! No! No! Thank you Tonari!

480
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:27,593
Oh, also funny story. Uh, there's a part where I'm shaking my butt...

481
00:34:27,593 --> 00:34:32,593
...during the Shabu Shabu Shabu and it was funny trying to portray how I wanted that to look.

482
00:34:32,593 --> 00:34:37,093
I had a meeting with Tonari, the team, and I was like, 'Hey, for this part right here...'

483
00:35:00,105 --> 00:35:02,405
two different dances that...

484
00:35:02,405 --> 00:35:04,305
uh I was going to do during those sections

485
00:35:04,305 --> 00:35:06,705
and I said, can we replace this one with me shaking my...

486
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,605
my... my butt?

487
00:35:10,105 --> 00:35:13,305
And the Tonari team was like, "What do you...?"

488
00:35:13,305 --> 00:35:15,205
"I don't... I can't visualize that. What do you mean?"

489
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:19,505
I said, "I'm like bent over sticking my tail in your face and I'm shaking."

490
00:35:19,505 --> 00:35:23,105
And then I remembered that it was reference from the... the New Year's stream

491
00:35:23,105 --> 00:35:25,905
when I sent that and they were like...

492
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:30,505
They were like: "Shaking your..."

493
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:32,505
"Shaking your what? At the... what?"

494
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,305
"Shaking your ha-?"

495
00:35:34,305 --> 00:35:35,505
I said, "Like this!"

496
00:35:35,505 --> 00:35:37,305
And they like, "Oh, okay."

497
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:40,905
So just... just literally you... butt to the camera?

498
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:42,605
I said, "Yes!"

499
00:35:44,905 --> 00:35:46,505
Exactly that.

500
00:35:47,505 --> 00:35:50,105
It was very yabe but it was very comical.
It was very risky but it was very comical.

501
00:35:50,105 --> 00:35:51,605
Very funny.

502
00:35:53,705 --> 00:35:56,305
Uh I'm very, very happy. I'm very happy.

503
00:35:56,305 --> 00:35:58,105
I'm very nervous still.

504
00:35:58,105 --> 00:35:59,605
But um...

505
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,705
Yeah!

506
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:06,705
And there was a lot of other Hololive members in there.

507
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:09,305
We had Council, we had Myth, we had...

508
00:36:10,605 --> 00:36:13,305
oh god, we had Chloe, we had Ollie.

509
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,105
Who else did we have?

510
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:18,605
I'm having a brain fart.

511
00:36:18,605 --> 00:36:21,505
Kanata? Choco?

512
00:36:23,105 --> 00:36:24,905
So yeah.

513
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:26,605
Thank you Tonari!

514
00:36:29,305 --> 00:36:31,605
Um... okay, let me see.

515
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:33,505
Let me just keep up with my brain.

516
00:36:33,505 --> 00:36:35,105
Ah, okay.

517
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:36,605
Okay.

518
00:36:37,105 --> 00:36:38,305
I'm going to sing now.

519
00:36:38,305 --> 00:36:40,505
I just want to sing you a song.

520
00:36:40,505 --> 00:36:43,105
I would like to sing you a song...

521
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:45,105
...because I need to calm down.

522
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:47,905
We're going to do karaoke now.

523
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:50,105
Hope that's alright.

524
00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:52,505
Is it going to be shaky? Probably.

525
00:36:53,705 --> 00:36:55,905
Am I a nervous birthday girl?

526
00:36:55,905 --> 00:36:57,505
Yeah.

527
00:36:59,305 --> 00:37:01,105
Um... what should we sing?

528
00:37:01,105 --> 00:37:02,605
Let's do this.

529
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:04,305
I just want to sing this.

530
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,505
Eenie, meenie, miny...

531
00:37:07,505 --> 00:37:09,305
...moe.

532
00:37:30,905 --> 00:37:34,105
To you...

533
00:37:34,105 --> 00:37:36,505
Sing a song to you.

534
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:48,105

589
00:41:52,617 --> 00:41:54,117
Who is that?

590
00:41:55,617 --> 00:41:58,117
Interrupting my karaoke.

591
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:34,117
Looks like the poor little Red Gura has to stay behind.

592
00:42:35,117 --> 00:42:39,117

00:42:48,617 --> 00:42:51,117
Somebody better have a balloon pump,

597
00:42:51,117 --> 00:42:54,117
'Cause I'm winning just by being 3D.

598
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:58,617
You still want to battle me? Okay.

599
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:02,117
What do you guys think?

600
00:43:02,117 --> 00:43:05,617
Should we battle the Red Gura in karaoke?

601
00:43:07,617 --> 00:43:08,617
What'd you say?

602
00:43:09,617 --> 00:43:10,617
Did you hear that?

603
00:43:10,617 --> 00:43:12,617
She said she's cuter than me.

604
00:43:12,617 --> 00:43:14,617

I'm cute! I am Gura! I'm...

606

Prove it!

608
00:43:21,617 --> 00:43:24,117
What do you mean? Prove it? I can prove it!

609
00:43:24,117 --> 00:43:28,617
I can prove it, but we're gonna have to step up the game, I think.

610
00:43:29,117 --> 00:43:34,117
I think I want to squish this little challenger even flatter than they already are.

611
00:43:34,617 --> 00:43:39,117
Do you hear me? You little red flat thing.

612
00:43:41,117 --> 00:43:42,617
Let me get ready.

613
00:43:42,617 --> 00:43:45,117
I'm bringing the big guns of cute, okay?

614
00:43:45,117 --> 00:43:47,117
Give me two seconds, I'll be back.

615
00:43:47,617 --> 00:43:52,117

00:50:21,141 --> 00:50:24,141

00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:18,641

00:52:19,141 --> 00:52:21,141
Yeah, fine. That was cute.

696
00:52:21,341 --> 00:52:23,141
It was fine. Whatever.

697
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:24,641
I was cute too.

698
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:26,441
Wasn't I?

699
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:30,641
Nemurenai... toroi mai... mmm mmm mmm

700
00:52:30,941 --> 00:52:34,641
I'm not getting shown up in my own birthday stream!

701
00:52:34,941 --> 00:52:37,141
Okay, fine. Whatever.

702
00:52:37,141 --> 00:52:39,141
If you... blah. Whatever.

703
00:52:39,141 --> 00:52:41,641
I still have a trick up my sleeve.

704
00:52:41,641 --> 00:52:42,641
You've seen me be cute.

705
00:52:43,141 --> 00:52:45,141
But how about a taste of...

706
00:52:45,641 --> 00:52:46,641
...cool?

707
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:48,641
Can you do cool, you little red snot?

708
00:52:51,141 --> 00:52:53,141
Wow, 25 points? Thank you.

709
00:52:53,641 --> 00:52:55,641
All right, fine! Fine, you want some Cool Gura?

710
00:52:55,641 --> 00:52:57,141
I'll do Cool Gura.

711
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:00,141
Cool...

712
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:02,141
...power activate!

713
00:53:54,141 --> 00:53:56,641
I have copied you...

714
00:53:56,641 --> 00:53:59,941
...and made of myself so crash and splash.

715
00:54:00,641 --> 00:54:02,641
I play with my obsession...

716
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:04,641
...I feel the tension...

717
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,941
...I need percussion.

718
00:54:07,641 --> 00:54:10,141
I would like to show...

719
00:54:10,141 --> 00:54:12,641
...cut open my skull, look into my head.

720
00:54:13,641 --> 00:54:16,141
I don't know why I'm so harsh...

721
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:18,641
...I could be so brash, I'm going to crash...

722
00:54:20,641 --> 00:54:22,641
...'cause I feel...

723
00:54:23,641 --> 00:54:27,641
I can always show my everything to you...

724
00:54:30,641 --> 00:54:33,641
If this moment was for me...

725
00:54:34,641 --> 00:54:37,141
I try to hear, lend my ear...

726
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:40,641
...for voices inside one link to join it all...

727
00:54:41,641 --> 00:54:44,641
...together.

728
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:51,141
All the things I knew...

729
00:54:51,141 --> 00:54:54,641
...the world I trusted would be the same.

730
00:54:55,641 --> 00:55:00,141
If I remained inside my protective castle and cave.

731
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:01,253
I've had my eyes closed

732
00:55:01,453 --> 00:55:05,053
Words are just a toy that people play with, it's superficial

733
00:55:05,353 --> 00:55:09,253
I know the proof is out there, the hidden answer that someone left there

734
00:55:09,353 --> 00:55:10,653
'Cause I feel...

735
00:55:10,753 --> 00:55:14,153
I can always show my everything to you

736
00:55:14,253 --> 00:55:16,953
If this moment works for me

737
00:55:17,053 --> 00:55:19,553
I'll try to hear, blend my inner voices

738
00:55:19,653 --> 00:55:23,153
Since I'm willing to join it all

739
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:27,153
If I can go travel back in time, start it all over again

740
00:55:27,253 --> 00:55:30,353
Follow a calculated path to live

741
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:33,553
But one day I will come across the same feeling again

742
00:55:33,653 --> 00:55:38,353
And know that it will carry over...

743
00:56:51,253 --> 00:56:52,553
'Cause I feel...

744
00:56:52,653 --> 00:56:56,153
I can always show my everything to you

745
00:56:56,253 --> 00:56:58,953
If this moment works for me

746
00:56:59,053 --> 00:57:01,553
I'll try to hear, blend my inner voices

747
00:57:01,653 --> 00:57:05,253
Since I'm willing to join it all

748
00:57:05,353 --> 00:57:08,653
So it goes again

749
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:05,453

750
00:58:05,553 --> 00:58:09,653

760
00:59:14,553 --> 00:59:17,453
むちゃくちゃ少女 捕まえたくない？
Don't you want to catch this crazy girl?

761
00:59:17,553 --> 00:59:20,453
Yo-ho-ho get the treasure, maybe tasting me?

762
00:59:20,553 --> 00:59:25,653
私の甘さが欲しいでしょう？
You want my sweetness, don't you?

763
00:59:25,753 --> 00:59:29,153

771
01:00:04,665 --> 01:00:08,665
Showing my knee.

772
01:00:08,665 --> 01:00:12,465
We will sail the seven seas.

773
01:00:12,465 --> 01:00:15,665

Across the seven seas.

774
01:00:15,665 --> 01:00:19,665

Open up this box.

Open it right now or I will scream!

781
01:00:44,365 --> 01:00:54,165

My, my, my... I mean, it's my birthday, I won, right?

798
01:02:34,365 --> 01:02:37,165
You can't hear me, right? Okay, fair enough, fair enough.

799
01:02:37,965 --> 01:02:43,165
A little red, where are you? Come here, you can join the stream now.

800
01:02:43,165 --> 01:02:46,165
You've been nice enough. On one condition.

801
01:02:47,165 --> 01:02:51,665
Okay. Oh. You did fine. You did great.

802
01:02:51,665 --> 01:02:58,165
Whatever. Really pulling out treasure box. Okay, I see how it is. Fine.

803
01:02:58,665 --> 01:03:02,665
Anyway, that was a fun little contest, wasn't it?

804
01:03:02,665 --> 01:03:06,665
We have some merchandise to talk about.

805
01:03:06,665 --> 01:03:09,665
Would you like to help me, Red Gura? I don't think she's gonna help me.

806
01:03:09,665 --> 01:03:12,665
So I guess it's just on me, you guys.

807
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:18,165
So, we're gonna talk about, it is the time, it is the birthday merchandise time.

808
01:03:18,165 --> 01:03:22,165
The link has been posted, I see, thank you, thank you Staff for helping.

809
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:26,665
So we're gonna go over the merchandise. Yay!

810
01:03:26,665 --> 01:03:32,165
I'll let you out of the jar if you behave, you stinky little minnow thing.

811
01:03:32,165 --> 01:03:38,165
Get out of here! What do you want? Where are you?

812
01:03:45,165 --> 01:03:51,665
Why are you so... Oh, I did that wrong, that's why.

813
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:57,165
Merchandise! There's no link... Oh, maybe it's not live yet. My bad.

814
01:03:57,665 --> 01:04:05,665
Birthday Celebration 2023. What do we got? Let's take a look.

815
01:04:06,165 --> 01:04:12,165
Gura's PC/Tablet Case, featuring the birthday art this year.

816
01:04:12,165 --> 01:04:22,165
Cute! My fellow iPad kids, it is time for us to have Gawr Gura themed tablet case.

817
01:04:26,665 --> 01:04:32,665
It's cute though, it's got Gura sticker on it too. It looks like I did it by hand.

818
01:04:32,665 --> 01:04:36,665
Cable Spaghetti Collector (Cable Tie).

819
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:42,165
It's funny because I was asked, what do you call this? And I said, 'Oh, it's the spaghetti collector'.

820
01:04:42,665 --> 01:04:52,165
Because they asked me what I want to call this, and I said 'spaghetti collector'. So they literally named it Cable Spaghetti Collector.

821
01:04:52,165 --> 01:04:59,564
It's a cable tie, it wraps up all your cables or your headphone cables or whatever's all tangled up.

822
01:05:00,177 --> 01:05:01,977
...pencils, whatever you want to do really.

823
01:05:01,977 --> 01:05:03,677
It'll help you clean up.

824
01:05:03,677 --> 01:05:07,577
I desperately need these because I am the number one culprit...

825
01:05:07,577 --> 01:05:10,277
...of cable spaghetti.

826
01:05:10,277 --> 01:05:13,377
They're cute though, they have Ebi and Bloop on them.

827
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:15,277
And they're blue, the most important part.

828
01:05:15,277 --> 01:05:16,677
What's next?

829
01:05:18,577 --> 01:05:23,177
guRED and BLUera Glass Set!

830
01:05:23,177 --> 01:05:26,677
Featuring today's competition!

831
01:05:27,677 --> 01:05:30,177
Red Gura...

832
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:33,177
guRED versus BLUera.

833
01:05:35,677 --> 01:05:38,377
Whose side are you on? Hmm?

834
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:41,477
Whose side are you on?

835
01:05:41,477 --> 01:05:44,377
Is this gonna be like a Twilight thing all over...?

836
01:05:44,377 --> 01:05:47,177
No, because at the end of the day, Gura is Gura.

837
01:05:47,177 --> 01:05:48,677
And Gura cute...

838
01:05:48,677 --> 01:05:51,177
...ish.

839
01:05:51,177 --> 01:05:54,177
Kind of smelly though, a little bit.

840
01:05:54,177 --> 01:05:55,477
Team BLUera!

841
01:05:55,477 --> 01:05:57,977
They're cute though, they're by Same-anko.

842
01:05:57,977 --> 01:05:59,677
I love Same-anko's stuff.

843
01:05:59,677 --> 01:06:03,377
And it might be hard to see from the stream, but if you zoom in...

844
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:07,577
...the Red Shark and stuff has like an angry face,

845
01:06:07,577 --> 01:06:10,677
and then the Blue Shark has a cute happy face. It's really cute.

846
01:06:10,677 --> 01:06:11,977
Yeah.

847
01:06:11,977 --> 01:06:13,677
You can drink the blood of your enemies...

848
01:06:13,677 --> 01:06:16,177
...or your morning strawberry smoothie.

849
01:06:16,177 --> 01:06:17,477
Whatever you desire.

850
01:06:17,477 --> 01:06:21,177
And then, the item that I am most excited about,

851
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:25,177
that I... I am so excited about is...

852
01:06:25,977 --> 01:06:27,477
He's real.

853
01:06:27,477 --> 01:06:29,977
Ebi-chan is real!

854
01:06:29,977 --> 01:06:34,177
You can get your hands on a big fat Ebi-chan!

855
01:06:34,177 --> 01:06:36,277
Perfect for squeezing.

856
01:06:36,277 --> 01:06:38,377
He's pocket-sized.

857
01:06:38,377 --> 01:06:40,577
Or as I like to compare it...

858
01:06:40,577 --> 01:06:44,377
Ebi-chan here is about the size of a healthy dill pickle.

859
01:06:44,377 --> 01:06:46,577
A whole dill pickle. Nya.

860
01:06:47,477 --> 01:06:51,477
And I scribbled my name on the bottom, just so you remember.

861
01:06:52,177 --> 01:06:56,377
I mean, you could put your name on it if you really want to,

862
01:06:56,377 --> 01:06:58,377
but I put my name on it.

863
01:06:58,377 --> 01:07:00,177
I guess that technically means you're mine.

864
01:07:00,177 --> 01:07:01,977
I can share though.

865
01:07:01,977 --> 01:07:04,377
We have Ebi-chan.

866
01:07:04,377 --> 01:07:06,677
I want to get a bunch and stack them on top of each other.

867
01:07:06,677 --> 01:07:10,477
Yeah, he's like the perfect size to grip tightly in your hand,

868
01:07:10,477 --> 01:07:14,177
so you could use him as a stress ball if you want.

869
01:07:14,177 --> 01:07:16,577
Or, I don't know, hit it with a baseball bat.

870
01:07:16,577 --> 01:07:18,677
Or... um... I don't know.

871
01:07:18,677 --> 01:07:22,677
Whatever. If you need a little bit of pocket motivation...

872
01:07:23,177 --> 01:07:25,577
He'll fit in your pocket.

873
01:07:25,577 --> 01:07:28,377
If you have him. Or on the top of your head like me.

874
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,677
Thank you.

875
01:07:31,177 --> 01:07:34,377
Ebi-chan. Ebi, Ebi, Ebi...

876
01:07:34,377 --> 01:07:36,677
Put it in a jar.

877
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:38,477
You don't have to put it in the jar.

878
01:07:38,477 --> 01:07:40,177
I mean, you could, but...

879
01:07:40,177 --> 01:07:43,177
I would put Red Gura in the jar before I put Ebi-chan in the jar.

880
01:07:43,177 --> 01:07:47,477
Ebi doesn't deserve it. Ebi doesn't deserve being put in the jar.

881
01:07:48,377 --> 01:07:51,477
In the jar. No, chat, no!

882
01:07:52,177 --> 01:07:54,477
No, my lovelies, please.

883
01:07:54,477 --> 01:07:56,477
Think before you act.

884
01:07:56,477 --> 01:07:59,377
What has this poor creature done to you?

885
01:07:59,377 --> 01:08:04,377
What if he's too heavy and he can't even support his front side?

886
01:08:04,377 --> 01:08:06,677
You wouldn't put a creature like that in a jar.

887
01:08:07,177 --> 01:08:09,677
You must nurture him and caress his tall antennae.

888
01:08:12,477 --> 01:08:16,377
And make cute heart shapes with it and send pictures to me.

889
01:08:17,477 --> 01:08:20,377
Fry it? Mmm, it's gonna taste like...

890
01:08:20,377 --> 01:08:24,177
...polyester and copper. Mmm, tasty.

891
01:08:24,177 --> 01:08:26,677
Put some butter on that. Mmm.

892
01:08:26,677 --> 01:08:29,377
Elevensies.

893
01:08:29,377 --> 01:08:32,577
Alright, I see. Caress, you can caress the Ebi gently though.

894
01:08:32,577 --> 01:08:34,177
He's very sensitive.

895
01:08:34,177 --> 01:08:36,477
They're a sensitive crustacean.

896
01:08:36,477 --> 01:08:38,377
Happy Birthday, Gura. Thank you!

897
01:08:38,377 --> 01:08:41,377
Yummy yummy. Nani?

898
01:08:41,377 --> 01:08:45,177
Yummy copper. No! Don't put... Don't put it in your mouth!

899
01:08:45,177 --> 01:08:48,677
It's not meant for your mouth. Your mouth hole.

900
01:08:48,677 --> 01:08:53,177
I love this little combo you guys can do now with the Ebi.

901
01:08:54,177 --> 01:08:57,377
The Ebi thumbs-up affirmation.

902
01:08:57,377 --> 01:09:01,477
The thumb-up affirmation Ebi emote. It's very cute.

903
01:09:01,477 --> 01:09:03,377
Yes, this one.

904
01:09:03,377 --> 01:09:04,677
I like it.

905
01:09:06,677 --> 01:09:10,177
Let's see what else. And we're gonna be doing illustration!

906
01:09:10,177 --> 01:09:13,377
Thank you, thank you. Sena, Sena-san!

907
01:09:13,377 --> 01:09:18,577
Thank you. Otsuki! I'm gonna be hand-signing, again.

908
01:09:18,577 --> 01:09:23,177
Let's everybody say a prayer that I can actually spell my name correctly.

909
01:09:23,177 --> 01:09:28,577
For those of you that got my incorrectly spelled name last time, I apologize.

910
01:09:29,677 --> 01:09:33,577
But hey, now you have proof that I'm a dum-dum.

911
01:09:33,577 --> 01:09:36,377
Physical proof.

912
01:09:36,377 --> 01:09:40,577
But yeah, I'm gonna be doing some more signy-signy-sign.

913
01:09:40,577 --> 01:09:44,377
And try really hard not to, yeah, spell the name wrong.

914
01:09:44,377 --> 01:09:46,577
Also... oh nevermind, I probably shouldn't say that one.

915
01:09:48,677 --> 01:09:51,477
Yeah! Ta-da!

916
01:09:52,577 --> 01:09:55,377
Plus a bonus for limited edition.

917
01:09:55,377 --> 01:09:57,477
So those are limited.

918
01:09:57,477 --> 01:09:58,677
I hate to say that...

919
01:09:58,677 --> 01:10:00,177
...but they are limited.

920
01:10:01,389 --> 01:10:02,489
Unfortunately, for now.

921
01:10:02,589 --> 01:10:07,689
Maybe someday I'll just be able to give out whatever, whatever everybody wants in unlimited quantities.

922
01:10:07,789 --> 01:10:09,689
The unlimited quant...

923
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:11,189
Is there a spelling mistake?

924
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:12,989
They always ask me...

925
01:10:13,189 --> 01:10:20,189
...they sometimes they ask me, they're like, "Hey Gura, can you, can you guess this for, or can you look at this for spelling mistakes?"

926
01:10:20,689 --> 01:10:23,189
And I say, "Yeah."

927
01:10:23,689 --> 01:10:27,189
And then I don't really do it because I am the worst person to do that with.

928
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:31,689
I'm... don't, please don't ask me that.

929
01:10:32,189 --> 01:10:36,189
It's sold out. Is it actually sold out, or is it just the website having to update?

930
01:10:36,289 --> 01:10:43,189
Cause that, that is the thing that happens with like merchandise websites is that they usually just go, "Oh, we sold out," but it just takes them a bit.

931
01:10:43,289 --> 01:10:50,189
It's not... is it actually? I don't think it's actually sold out.

932
01:10:52,189 --> 01:10:54,189
Nah...

933
01:10:55,189 --> 01:10:58,189
It's gone. Why?

934
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:03,189
Boo!

935
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:08,689
Limited is sold out. I'm so sorry.

936
01:11:09,189 --> 01:11:14,189
Well, hmm... I'm gonna hold out hope that the website was... is being smelly.

937
01:11:14,289 --> 01:11:16,689
The website's being smelly.

938
01:11:25,189 --> 01:11:30,189
Well, um... maybe, maybe I know. I'll pull management aside and I'll say...

939
01:11:30,289 --> 01:11:33,189
..."Because I'm the birthday girl..."

940
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:38,189
...as my birthday girl wish, I would like to ensure that everybody gets exactly what they want.

941
01:11:39,189 --> 01:11:46,689
As I... since I am the birthday girl, I therefore would like everybody else to be a birthday person and get their birthday wish as well.

942
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:49,189
Yeah, let's see if that passes.

943
01:11:49,689 --> 01:11:54,189
Pretty please, I have a thing of sprinkles right here. Because I eat them.

944
01:11:54,289 --> 01:11:56,689
I just eat sprinkles out of the jar.

945
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:59,189
Pretty please, with sprinkles on top!

946
01:12:00,189 --> 01:12:01,689
Pretty, pretty please!

947
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:08,189
Gawr Gura Birthday Celebration 2023 Merch List

948
01:12:08,289 --> 01:12:10,189
Birthday Celebration 2023: On Sale June 21st

949
01:12:11,189 --> 01:12:15,189
Why? Because. Do you guys remember when I used to drink maple syrup right out of the jar?

950
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:22,189
I used to do that. For those of you that don't know, I used to have a jar of uh, sugar-free maple syrup...

951
01:12:22,289 --> 01:12:26,689
...that had like a baby bottle nozzle on the top and I would just pop it open...

952
01:12:26,789 --> 01:12:30,189
...and take like a slurp in between the stream or something.

953
01:12:30,289 --> 01:12:33,689
Ooh, yummy! Mmm, maple syrup! Mmm!

954
01:12:34,189 --> 01:12:36,689
If only I had a mouthful of butter. "Isn't it too sweet?" No, not at all.

955
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:44,189
It's like baby food. Well no, I wouldn't give, I wouldn't give a baby sugar-free maple syrup. I'm just a big baby, that's all.

956
01:12:45,189 --> 01:12:49,689
A baby bottle pop of maple syrup and yummies.

957
01:12:55,189 --> 01:12:59,189
Whoa! Thank you guys, thank you everybody. Thank you for making this an amazing birthday.

958
01:12:59,289 --> 01:13:02,189
A very, very amazing birthday.

959
01:13:03,189 --> 01:13:10,189
Also, it's kind of funny. The theme was originally for my birthday like blues and, and yellows and cozy like that.

960
01:13:10,289 --> 01:13:13,689
But then last minute I was like, "I need pink!"

961
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:18,189
I require pink and yellow and purple and polka-dot...

962
01:13:18,289 --> 01:13:25,189
...and a cute birthday hat with cupcakes and like really cute everything and sparkles and stuff.

963
01:13:25,289 --> 01:13:30,189
It's kind of... I don't know, I just think that's kind of funny. Oh well, still cute though.

964
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:34,689
Should we let Stinky out of the jar? Do you think she's been behaved?

965
01:13:35,689 --> 01:13:39,189
I have her labeled as "Red Devil" in my, in my stream. Let's let you out.

966
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:45,189
I'll let you out just this once since you... you can come and hang out with everybody.

967
01:13:45,289 --> 01:13:49,189
Oh, you're so cute when you're up close! Wow!

968
01:13:51,689 --> 01:13:54,189
That's pretty cool. Sorry, she's talking to me, but you can't hear her.

969
01:13:56,689 --> 01:14:02,189
Trust me, she's talking to me. Little goblin. Little goblin, little tiny little thing.

970
01:14:02,289 --> 01:14:06,189
Little, I don't know. Little baby?

971
01:14:08,689 --> 01:14:15,189
Little baby says she wants to sing another song. Is she whispering evil? No, no, no.

972
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:22,189
She wants to sing some more because she's feeling very proud of herself for winning... winning over the chat.

973
01:14:22,289 --> 01:14:24,189
Winning, she says, she says she's just been winning.

974
01:14:25,189 --> 01:14:27,689
Superior song choices. Okay, okay, okay.

975
01:14:28,189 --> 01:14:30,189
We can sing one more song together, what do you guys think?

976
01:14:31,189 --> 01:14:35,189
An encore! The winner was chat. Chat wins all along.

977
01:14:36,689 --> 01:14:40,189
Everybody wins. Everybody a winner.

978
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:46,189
I like the "everybody a winner." Should we do an encore? Stinky smelly little fishy? Yeah?

979
01:14:47,189 --> 01:14:52,189
Should we do it together? I think we should do a song together, what do you think?

980
01:14:52,289 --> 01:14:55,189
I think that would be cute.

981
01:14:55,289 --> 01:14:59,689
I think that would be a cute reminder that at the end of the day, we're all in...

982
01:15:00,201 --> 01:15:01,441
...us together.

983
01:15:04,481 --> 01:15:06,521
God, I'm so awkward. Maybe you should take over, Red Gura...

984
01:15:06,601 --> 01:15:10,161
...'cause then maybe you won't be as awkward as I am. This is painful. Okay.

985
01:15:10,321 --> 01:15:13,681
We're going to go ahead... We're going to go ahead and then sing something.

986
01:15:13,761 --> 01:15:18,161
We'll figure it out behind the scenes, 'cause I don't... I know what we're going to sing.

987
01:15:18,241 --> 01:15:20,321
I know exactly what we're going to sing.

988
01:15:20,401 --> 01:15:21,521
Okay. You ready, Gur?

989
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:26,681
Gur... uh... Okay, she's ready.

990
01:15:27,761 --> 01:15:30,641
All right. Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore!

991
01:15:30,721 --> 01:15:33,441
Encore!

992
01:15:55,241 --> 01:15:58,401
Always keep your eyes on the line of the horizon.

993
01:15:58,481 --> 01:16:01,521
Come on, chumbuds, climb on board and celebrate our days.

994
01:16:01,681 --> 01:16:03,681
Yeah!

995
01:16:15,281 --> 01:16:18,641
Waves will knock you down, and currents pull you out, ah-ah.

996
01:16:19,681 --> 01:16:21,721
Life hits you with the ocean...

997
01:16:21,961 --> 01:16:26,001
Tryna make a splash, but every stream is crashed, oh no!

998
01:16:26,641 --> 01:16:28,281
But still we keep on swimming!

999
01:16:28,361 --> 01:16:31,201
鮫 鮫 鮫 鮫
Shark, shark, shark, shark

1000
01:16:31,281 --> 01:16:34,681
ちょっともくさつ 誘って 走り出そう 準備は Every day
A little silence, let's head out together, preparing every day

1001
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:37,521
鮫 鮫 鮫 鮫
Shark, shark, shark, shark

1002
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:40,681
吸いまで世 起きは浮きよう 良い商い 一緒に
To the edge of the world, life's transient, good trade, together

1003
01:16:41,161 --> 01:16:43,241
It's almost time, just give me a sec.

1004
01:16:44,361 --> 01:16:47,481
A thousand years to hook in a net...

1005
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,281
With a hand to hold, we're not alone.

1006
01:16:49,361 --> 01:16:51,681
Got a high of go then head above... no wait...

1007
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:55,481
The fun's just begun, being hydro-dynamic is just more fun!

1008
01:16:55,561 --> 01:16:58,481
So hang on, 'cause the water's dropped, here we go, down, down, down!

1009
01:17:04,641 --> 01:17:07,681
Come sail away with me!

1010
01:17:11,201 --> 01:17:15,721
Our future's beyond the sea, the sun rise shine on our lives.

1011
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:18,721
This old dream we carry each.

1012
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:22,721
So no matter how we grow...

1013
01:17:22,801 --> 01:17:25,721
...just always know.

1014
01:17:28,361 --> 01:17:30,161
あ、あ、鮫々です！
A, a, Am-same-same desu!

1015
01:17:36,001 --> 01:17:38,401
Always keep your eyes on the line of the horizon.

1016
01:17:38,481 --> 01:17:43,201
Come on, chumbuds, climb on board and celebrate our days!

1017
01:17:49,201 --> 01:17:51,721
Okay, everybody, that's it for...

1018
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:56,681
...my birthday stream of 2023! Pew! Woohoo! Yeah!

1019
01:18:00,201 --> 01:18:04,241
I hope you enjoyed your time today with me.

1020
01:18:04,321 --> 01:18:08,721
Thank you very much for spending time with me and for saying hey after all this time.

1021
01:18:08,801 --> 01:18:10,721
I really appreciate it.

1022
01:18:10,801 --> 01:18:13,241
I hope you had fun. I hope you were entertained...

1023
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:17,721
...even just a little bit. I hope... I hope your days are going well and your...

1024
01:18:17,801 --> 01:18:22,241
...your life is going well, honestly.

1025
01:18:22,321 --> 01:18:25,721
Thank you so much again for the support.

1026
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:28,721
I hope you enjoyed everything that I've shown you today.

1027
01:18:28,801 --> 01:18:33,721
Huge thanks to everybody that has helped to make today's stream possible.

1028
01:18:33,801 --> 01:18:37,241
Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1029
01:18:37,321 --> 01:18:42,721
And thank you to Manessan as well for helping me through all of this. I really appreciated it.

1030
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:46,241
We have more fun stuff coming in the summer.

1031
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:49,721
It's a big summer, you guys. I hope you're strapped in and ready.

1032
01:18:50,161 --> 01:18:53,681
Strap in, buttercups. It's going to be a big one.

1033
01:18:55,201 --> 01:18:57,721
I'm very excited, and you should be too.

1034
01:18:58,721 --> 01:19:00,681
Yahoo!

1035
01:19:01,201 --> 01:19:05,721
Also, there might be another bigger Gumba 3D live on the horizon...

1036
01:19:05,801 --> 01:19:10,201
...mmm, perhaps? Mmm, perhaps? It'll probably be quite a bit of ways from now...

1037
01:19:10,281 --> 01:19:13,721
...but just so you know, just another thing to look forward to.

1038
01:19:13,801 --> 01:19:17,721
Wahoo! Yippee-yippee-yippee!

1039
01:19:21,201 --> 01:19:24,241
Thank you though, guys. I'm excited.

1040
01:19:26,681 --> 01:19:29,721
Thank you as always. Thank you for everything. Thank you as always and forever.

1041
01:19:30,201 --> 01:19:33,241
Um, I'll see you around, okay?

1042
01:19:34,201 --> 01:19:37,721
Happy Birthday to me and to any of you if it's your birthday!

1043
01:19:38,201 --> 01:19:40,721
Happy Birthday. I'm sweating.

1044
01:19:42,201 --> 01:19:45,721
Thank you, guys. I hope you have a lovely day. I will see you...

1045
01:19:46,721 --> 01:19:50,241
I'll see you... trying to think of like a fun ocean word.

1046
01:19:52,681 --> 01:19:55,241
I'll see you in the, in the... ocean. I'll see you...

1047
01:19:58,721 --> 01:20:00,041
I'll swim by!

1048
01:20:00,213 --> 01:20:01,338
...at least not on this bed.

1049
01:20:01,613 --> 01:20:02,713
I'll see you.

1050
01:20:05,393 --> 01:20:07,243
Happy birthday to me!

1051
01:20:07,813 --> 01:20:12,393
Gooba, gooba-gooba, gubba-gubba-gubba-gubba, gooba!

1052
01:20:12,463 --> 01:20:14,313
Goodbye! Say bye, Gurura.

1053
01:20:15,353 --> 01:20:17,913
She said... Oh, I can't repeat that.

1054
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:18,633
Bye!

1055
01:20:19,563 --> 01:20:20,413
Bye!

1056
01:20:20,763 --> 01:20:22,563
Say bye, Gura. Say bye, Gura.

1057
01:20:24,063 --> 01:20:26,913
Bye-bye! Bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye!

1058
01:20:28,213 --> 01:20:32,213
Bye... Bye...

1059
01:20:33,613 --> 01:21:07,346
See you!
