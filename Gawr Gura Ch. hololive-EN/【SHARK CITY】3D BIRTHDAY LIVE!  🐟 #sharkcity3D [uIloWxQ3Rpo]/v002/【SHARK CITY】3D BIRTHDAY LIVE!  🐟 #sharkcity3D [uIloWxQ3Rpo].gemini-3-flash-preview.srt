ひめごとの　終わりに誰もが　一人で寝顔
At the end of a secret,
everyone has a sleeping face alone

325
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,867
Happy birthday to me!

326
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:46,667
Hi! How did you enjoy the live?

327
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:49,167
Hello, hello!

328
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:52,467
Ooh, birthday merch time! Ooh!

329
00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:57,667
This birthday features beautiful art by the ultra-talented Utachako-tan!

330
00:41:57,667 --> 00:42:00,567
This time inspired by the city pop genre.

331
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:04,667
I got the hot rod behind me, I'm in my 80s inspired idol outfit.

332
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:08,167
Get in, Ebies, we're going cruising!

333
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:12,667
This piece also will be available as a canvas.

334
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:16,667
You know what that means? Shark art appreciation time! Hehe!

335
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,667
Also by Utachako-san,

336
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:25,567
a really cool sweatshirt featuring these plans and coordinates to the ultimate shark girl. Hehe!

337
00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:28,667
This design has so many little details.

338
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,567
I can't decide if I want to wear mine

339
00:42:30,567 --> 00:42:32,067
or display it,

340
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:35,467
or- or buy one to wear and one to display.

341
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:37,067
Ah, I don't know!

342
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:41,967
But I love it so much, I think this is one of my favorite merch designs

343
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:44,667
I've ever come across for myself, so I'm really excited!

344
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:48,667
And then we have the Shark Keychain! You can match with me!

345
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:52,067
It's the same one I'm wearing in the canvas illustration.

346
00:42:52,067 --> 00:42:55,167
There's a little Ebi, and a little Sharky,

347
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:57,767
and a trident, and it's blue,

348
00:42:57,767 --> 00:43:00,567
my favorite color, and it's so cute!

349
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:03,567
If everyone matches together, we can spot-

350
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:06,167
spot each other in the wild

351
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,967
and then make awkward eye contact.

352
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:11,267
It'll be great, right?

353
00:43:11,267 --> 00:43:15,167
And finally, if you purchase the set as a bundle,

354
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:20,167
it'll come with a very exclusive polaroid, hand-signed by me!

355
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:24,567
The bundle option is of course limited, so act quickly if you're interested.

356
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:28,167
The links to the- the purchasing of the merchandise

357
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:30,767
will be available in the description

358
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:33,567
and probably alongside the- the chat.

359
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:36,367
Hello! Hello in the chat bar! Yes, woohoo!

360
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:40,667
Okay, I'm off to eat a very large piece of cake that does not say "feet" on it.

361
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:44,567
Totally. Ha... Not this year. Maybe next year. Heh.

362
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:47,967
Thanks for coming to my birthday party! Yippee!

363
00:43:47,967 --> 00:43:50,167
Buh-bye now! Thank you! Buh-bye!
