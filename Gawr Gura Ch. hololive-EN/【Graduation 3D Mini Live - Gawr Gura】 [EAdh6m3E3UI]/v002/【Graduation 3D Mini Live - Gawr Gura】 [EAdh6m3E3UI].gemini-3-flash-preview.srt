00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:49,208
こうしてあなたが
Because you were here

68
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:15,508

一人で見上げた夜空に花火
Fireworks in the night sky I looked up at alone

76
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:47,408

Stay my heart

81
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,866
何食わぬ顔をして
Putting on an innocent face

82
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:11,816
キスを奪って
Stealing a kiss

83
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:13,516
Don't go away

84
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,016
いつかまたなんて
Saying "some other time"

85
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:23,516

00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:56,216
Myth or Treat, your oshi's waiting in the closet tonight

91
00:10:56,216 --> 00:10:59,516
No wait, stop, she's dead set on giving you a fright

92
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:03,016
Trick or treat but now we're all out of candy

93
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:06,016
Feeling just a little sick, this chainsaw oughta come in handy

94
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:09,516
Chat is blushing, the gators' red cheeks

95
00:11:14,316 --> 00:11:18,016
I'll fix that up, drain all your

96
00:11:18,016 --> 00:11:21,516

00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:26,016
you seek

98
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:31,016
Myth or treat, oh what a crucified stream

99
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:34,516
There's no bones about it, you'll scream

100

scarier sights

102
00:11:41,216 --> 00:11:44,816
Oh what a gotcha-ya night

00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:48,016
Mythic witches with endless spite

104
00:11:48,016 --> 00:11:51,316
Can't escape our idol-ized might

105
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:54,216
No candy in sight, so your souls will suffice

106

We walk once more to the end

120
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,816
Burn it down

121
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:32,316
Burn it down

122
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:36,416
Waves can't put out my flame

123
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:40,416
Death will never write my name

124
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,816
Burn it down

125
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:45,016
Burn it down

126
00:13:45,316 --> 00:13:51,516
They say the memory of me is fading

127
00:13:51,516 --> 00:13:54,016
I've heard it all before

128
00:13:54,016 --> 00:13:57,816
Don't tell me everyone around is waiting

129
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:06,516
And they all say

130
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:08,516
Tear it down

131
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,516
Burn it down

132
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,316
And they'll all pay

133
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:16,516
When I tear it down

134
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:19,416
Burn it down

135
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:23,316
When the world falls through

136
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:27,416
And all is ash again

137
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,216
While you all pretend

138
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:36,516
If this is the end, I'll do it again

139
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:44,816
Voices rise in my head

140
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:49,016
The hands that pull at my thread

141
00:14:49,016 --> 00:14:51,316
Let them drown

142
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:53,616
Burn it down

143
00:14:53,616 --> 00:14:57,316
Wait for wash in the tide

144
00:14:57,316 --> 00:15:00,016
In the abyss is where I will hide

145
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,224
...will hide

146
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:05,524
Let them drown Burn it down

147
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:11,824
They say the memory of me is fading

148
00:15:13,524 --> 00:15:15,024
I've heard it all before

149
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:20,524
Don't tell me everyone around is waiting

150
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,524
And they all say

151
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:31,524
Tear it down Burn it down

152
00:15:32,524 --> 00:15:33,824
And they'll all pay

153
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:40,524
When I tear it down burn it down

154
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:44,824
When the world falls through

155
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:49,024
And all is ash again

156
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,524
While you all pretend

157
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:55,024
If this is the end

158
00:15:55,024 --> 00:15:58,524
I'll do it again

159
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:06,024
We swim against the current's aim

160
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:13,024
In dark we change as smoke returns to rain

161
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:22,524
Navigating sunken depths and all of its debris

162
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:27,524
And no more hands upon my words

163
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:31,024
They only speak for me

164
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:40,024
For all the ones who try to silence thunder

165
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:48,524
I'm the wave that pulls you down and under

166
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:51,524
Everyday I'll stand with me

167
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:57,024
And I'll fight the drought of shallow sea

168
00:16:57,024 --> 00:17:04,024
As ships sail winds of jealousy I'll listen

169
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,524
carefully

170
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:08,824
Let it all burn down

171
00:17:08,824 --> 00:17:12,524
As they all say

172
00:17:12,524 --> 00:17:17,524
Tear it down Burn it down

173
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:20,524
And they'll all pay

174
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:25,824
When I tear it down Burn it down

175
00:17:26,024 --> 00:17:30,524
When the world falls through

176
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:34,024
And all is ash again

177
00:17:34,024 --> 00:17:38,024
While you all pretend

178
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:41,524
If this is the end

179
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:45,024
I'll do it again

180
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:04,524
Hi, hello, hello hello thank you hello

181
00:18:05,524 --> 00:18:11,524
Hi, um, from the very bottom of my shark heart,

182
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,524
thank you.

183
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:16,524
Um, if I could borrow your ear

184
00:18:16,524 --> 00:18:19,524
for just a... just a bit more time,

185
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:22,524
I want to thank you, um, again.

186
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:27,024
Thank you for letting me be your shark idol

187
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:30,024
for the last half a decade.

188
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:35,524
Five years, wow. Just about five years or so.

189
00:18:36,524 --> 00:18:40,524
Um, in this time, I... I...

190
00:18:40,524 --> 00:18:44,024
I have loved performing for you...

191
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:48,524
...here or on stage or in my bedroom,

192
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:51,524
any... anywhere really.

193
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:54,024
Um, I... yeah, wow.

194
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:57,524
Speaking... speaking of half a decade,

195
00:18:57,524 --> 00:19:00,524
when I first joined Hololive,

196
00:19:01,024 --> 00:19:04,524
I had barely any experience in streaming

197
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:09,524
or dancing or singing in front of people.

198
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:13,524
I couldn't even sing in front of my own mother.

199
00:19:14,024 --> 00:19:18,524
Um, but... but now, now look at me, right?

200
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:23,524
Um, I won't lie, it was really hard to get my footing.

201
00:19:23,524 --> 00:19:26,024
Um, sometimes it was terrifying.

202
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:29,524
No, a lot of the time it was terrifying.

203
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:33,524
But spending time with you and all of the

204
00:19:33,524 --> 00:19:37,024
incredibly talented members Hololive has

205
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:40,024
been an absolute pleasure...

206
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:45,024
...and I can truly say, a highlight in my life.

207
00:19:45,524 --> 00:19:49,524
I will never forget my time here at Hololive.

208
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:54,024
I... I feel like I've been able to grow a lot

209
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:56,524
in these past years.

210
00:19:56,524 --> 00:20:00,024
Not in height or brain activity, but...

211
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:01,532
In my heart,

212
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:03,832
like my confidence...

213
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:06,032
my confidence in myself,

214
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:10,532
I believe in myself a whole lot more now than I did five years ago and...

215
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:13,532
oh, it's thanks to you.

216
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:17,032
So thank you everyone

217
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,532
for your compassion, your creativity,

218
00:20:20,632 --> 00:20:23,032
and your dedication

219
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:24,432
to me,

220
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,532
your Goomba.

221
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:30,032
Thank you to my Myth ladies.

222
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:35,532
We've been through so, so much together.

223
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:43,032
And I am honored to have been able to go on this journey with you girls.

224
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:46,532
Thank you to Nacho-mama

225
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:51,532
for always working so hard and making me so darn cute.

226
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:55,232
And thank you to my chumbuds

227
00:20:55,332 --> 00:20:59,032
for always being there for me,

228
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,032
for pushing me to try new games,

229
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:04,832
new songs, new experiences.

230
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:08,532
Thank you for everything.

231
00:21:10,532 --> 00:21:14,532
Ah! I-I-I've got a Gulf Stream current to catch.

232
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:20,032
Time to Otsu-same one last time.

233
00:21:20,532 --> 00:21:22,032
Ready?

234
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:26,532
OTSU-SAME!

235
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:28,332
The biggest!

236
00:21:28,532 --> 00:21:30,532
Take care

237
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:33,532
and be kind to yourselves.

238
00:21:33,732 --> 00:21:34,532
Okay?

239
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:35,532
Okay.

240
00:21:35,832 --> 00:21:37,332
Good night

241
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:39,332
and goodbye.

242
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,032
Goodbye, goodbye!

243
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:44,032
Goodbye, goodbye!

244
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:46,032
Bye-bye!

245
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:49,032
Goodbye!
