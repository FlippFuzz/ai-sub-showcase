REFLECT (Jazz ver.)
Artist: Gawr Gura

5
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:34,133
水面に映る自分がいた
I saw myself reflected on the water's surface.

6
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:42,633
あぁ私は悪いサメです
Ah, I am a bad shark.

7
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:47,966
ずっと逸らしていた
I had been averting my eyes.

8
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:51,883
赤く光るその目
Those red glowing eyes.

9
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:59,591
海の底暗闇に消えていく
Disappearing into the darkness at the bottom of the sea.

10
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:02,841
どうして泣くのよ
Why are you crying?

11
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:08,091
欲しいものなら全部手に入れた
I got everything I wanted.

12
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,508
教えて私は
Tell me, did I...

13
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:16,883
望んでいた私になれたかな
...become the person I wanted to be?

14
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:21,091
嘘はつかないでも本当じゃない
I don't lie, but it's not the truth either.

15
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:25,091
本音は言わない他愛もない
I don't say my true feelings, it's just trivial talk.

16
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:29,049
いつかはどこかで
Someday, somewhere...

17
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:34,049
分かり合える時が来るの
...will the time come when we can understand each other?

18
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:54,091
ずっと追い求めた
I've always searched for it.

19
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:58,091
私なりの答え
My own answer.

20
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:03,049
自分には嘘つきたくない
I don't want to lie to myself.

23
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:07,956
ごめんね
Sorry...

24
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:09,456
今まで
Until now...

25
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:14,456
気づかなかったことがあるんだけど
こうして
There are things I hadn't noticed, but
in this way,

26
00:10:16,556 --> 00:10:23,456
あなたがいてくれたから今の私はいる
because you were here for me, I am who I am now.

27
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,956
過去は消えない そんなことはない
"The past doesn't disappear," that's not true.

28
00:10:27,356 --> 00:10:30,956
未来は見えない おこがましいじゃない
"The future can't be seen," isn't that presumptuous?

29
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:38,456
ここから 静かに私を見守っていてね
From here, please quietly keep watching over me.

30
00:10:53,956 --> 00:10:57,956
さよなら ありがとう
Goodbye, thank you.

31
00:10:58,156 --> 00:11:02,456
隠していた私はもういない
The me I was hiding is no longer here.

32
00:11:02,756 --> 00:11:06,756
さよなら ありがとう
Goodbye, thank you.

33
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:10,956
全て受け入れて生きていくから
Because I will live on, accepting everything.

34
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:15,456
海の底はつまらないけど
The bottom of the sea is boring, but...

35
00:11:15,656 --> 00:11:19,456
あなたのことは見つめているから
because I'm watching over you...

36
00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:27,956
いつでも どこでも 私らしく生きていこう
Anytime, anywhere, let's live true to ourselves.

かーもね! ハイ!
Might be! Yes!

43
00:12:09,956 --> 00:12:12,756

ほら むにゃむにゃむにゃ
Look, mumble mumble mumble.

ハイ! ハイ! ハイ! ハイ!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:41,456

Even more than yesterday, maybe! Maybe! Yes!

54
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:08,456
ハイ! ハイ! ハイ! ハイ! ハイ! ハイ! ハイ!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

Yay! Ah, okay.

00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:23,456
I have a lot to show you today.

73
00:14:23,956 --> 00:14:27,156
Oh, and we have a lot of guests to sing with as well.

74
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:34,456
So, I'm going to need you to stand up and let's get this party started! Woo!

Thank you to the Japanese fans for coming.
It makes me happy that you always support me.

76
00:14:43,956 --> 00:14:53,456
Hmm, first to the stage for the first time ever, Reflect jazz flavor. My first song ever.

77
00:14:53,956 --> 00:15:01,456
I wanted to give it a special new touch just for you.
Um, it's a little different from the original, but...

78
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:04,011
I really like it. Jazzified.

79
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:07,011
Maybe I'm biased, so...

80
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:10,411
...but I hope you enjoyed it regardless.

81
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:12,911
How do you like the stage though?

82
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:16,111
みて、みて! Look!
Look, look! Look!

83
00:15:16,111 --> 00:15:20,711
Look at this ebi over here. Looking suave, I know?
Look at this shrimp over here. Looking suave, I know?

84
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:24,911
Oh, and how many fish can you spot, hmm?

85
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:29,911
There's quite a few. There's, uh, Royal Blue Tang, and then there's Yellow Tang...

86
00:15:29,911 --> 00:15:34,911
...and I'm sure, I'm sure you guys know all about your fish, right? All your fishes. Of course you do.

87
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:40,511
I gotta say though, all this dancing is making me hungry.

88
00:15:40,511 --> 00:15:45,911
And all this fish talk is making me, hmm, hungry-mungry.

89
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:49,911
I guess it's time for guest then, no?

90
00:15:50,411 --> 00:15:52,411

うん、相思相愛！
Yeah, mutual love!

162
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:30,652
But after that, that song, I am a little hungry.

163
00:20:31,352 --> 00:20:34,252
What food do you like, Gura?

164
00:20:34,852 --> 00:20:39,052
Hmm, I'm pretty hungry too. Mogu mogu mogu...

165
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:42,652
I really love salmon. What do you like?

00:20:43,852 --> 00:20:52,352
Oh... I like fish, and shark fin, and...

167

243
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,060
But it is summer, so I guess that makes sense.

244
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,060
Oh, speaking of summer, do you like eating melon?

245
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,360

Um... but summer is nice.

250
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,060
I like the beach and eating watermelon too.

251
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,860
あ、シオンは泳ぐことができますか？
Ah, Shion, can you swim?

252
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,660
できるよ。
I can.

253
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,360
ほう！
Hoh!

254
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,660

Ehh!?

256
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,860
No way!

257
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,660
それは無理！
That's impossible!

258
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,860
息がそんなに持たないよ。
I can't hold my breath that long.

259
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,060
いや大丈夫大丈夫。
No, it's okay, it's okay.

260
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,360
I will help.

261
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,060
じゃ、考えておく。
Then, I'll think about it.

262
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,860
はい。
Yes.

263
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,360
Okay, it's a promise.

264
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,060
But now it's time for the next song.

265
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,360
Thank you Shion.

266
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,360

00:30:38,568 --> 00:30:41,368
I'm so excited we can sing together again.

300
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:44,068
I'm kind of nervous...

301
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:49,168
...like I can't control my heart, it's beating very, very rapidly. ドキドキドキドキ。
...like I can't control my heart, it's beating very, very rapidly. Doki-doki-doki-doki.

302
00:30:49,568 --> 00:30:52,568
マリンとあくあはどうですか？
How about you, Marine and Aqua?

303
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:54,368
Me too, doki-doki.

304
00:30:54,368 --> 00:30:58,968
Gura, it was my dream to sing on stage with you.

305
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:02,168
So, I am really happy.

306
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:05,768
Please sing at my next live too.

307
00:31:06,968 --> 00:31:09,868
Really? I would be honored, Marine.

308
00:31:11,068 --> 00:31:14,568
私もソロライブの時はまだ3Dじゃなかったから...
Back during my solo live, I didn't have a 3D model yet...

309
00:31:14,668 --> 00:31:17,368
...3Dで一緒に歌えて嬉しい。
...so I'm happy we can sing together in 3D.

310
00:31:17,368 --> 00:31:18,168
Yeah!

311
00:31:18,568 --> 00:31:21,368
あー、ぐら、ぐら。
Ah, Gura, Gura.

312
00:31:21,368 --> 00:31:23,268
Can I ask a favor?

313
00:31:23,368 --> 00:31:25,768
ふん... I want to be eaten by you, Gura.
Hum... I want to be eaten by you, Gura.

314
00:31:29,368 --> 00:31:32,768
It depends on what you taste like.

315
00:31:34,168 --> 00:31:36,468
どんな味だろう？
I wonder what you taste like?

316
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:39,268
Dangerous Marine smell.

317
00:31:39,868 --> 00:31:41,368
Recent? やべー。
Recent? Oh boy.

318
00:31:45,168 --> 00:31:49,368
I hope we have more opportunities to perform together soon.

319
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:53,268
Sure! Please invite me anytime.

320
00:31:53,668 --> 00:31:55,168
いいね！
That sounds good!

321
00:31:56,068 --> 00:31:58,868
Thank you guys for coming today.

322
00:31:58,868 --> 00:32:00,068
Bye-bye!

323
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,068
Bye-bye! Gura, congratulations!

324
00:32:03,168 --> 00:32:04,568
ありがとう！
Thank you!

325
00:32:04,568 --> 00:32:06,068
Bye-bye!

326
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:18,368
My Soul, Your Beats!

327
00:32:34,368 --> 00:32:37,768
目覚めては繰り返す
Awakening, it repeats

328
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:41,068
眠い朝は
These sleepy mornings

329
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:44,168
襟のタイを
Tightening the tie

330
00:32:44,268 --> 00:32:47,168
きつく締め
At my collar

331
00:32:47,668 --> 00:32:50,668
教室のドアくぐると
When I pass through the classroom door

332
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,968
ほんの少し
I puff out my chest

333
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:56,968
胸を張って
Just a little bit

334
00:32:57,468 --> 00:33:00,568
歩き出せる
And I can start walking

335
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:03,868
そんな日常に
In that everyday life

336
00:33:03,968 --> 00:33:07,268
吹き抜ける風
The wind blowing through

337
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:10,468
聞こえた気がした
I felt like I heard it

338
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:13,668
感じた気がしたんだ
I felt like I could feel it

339
00:33:17,168 --> 00:33:19,168
震え出す
Starting to tremble

340
00:33:19,268 --> 00:33:21,168
今この胸で
Right now, in this heart

341
00:33:21,268 --> 00:33:24,268
もう来る気がした
I felt like it was already coming

342
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:27,668
幾億の星が
Billions of stars

343
00:33:27,768 --> 00:33:31,168
消えていくのを
Watching them

344
00:33:31,268 --> 00:33:35,268
見送った
As they disappear

345
00:33:35,668 --> 00:33:39,168
手を振った
I waved my hand

346
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:42,868
よかったね、と
Saying, 'I'm glad'

347
00:33:44,568 --> 00:33:47,768
廊下の隅見下ろす
Looking down from the corner of the hallway

348
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:51,068
掃除の途中
While I was cleaning

349
00:33:51,168 --> 00:33:54,268
おかしなもの
I think it's

350
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:56,868
だと思う
A strange thing

351
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:00,668
あたしの中の時間は
Even though time inside of me

352
00:34:00,768 --> 00:34:03,968
止まってるのに
Has stopped

353
00:34:04,068 --> 00:34:07,368
違う日々を
As if I'm living

354
00:34:07,468 --> 00:34:10,468
生きてるように
Through different days

355
00:34:10,568 --> 00:34:13,768
埃は雪の
The dust piles up

356
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:17,168
ように降り積む
Like snow

357
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:20,368
待ってる気がした
I felt like I was waiting

358
00:34:20,468 --> 00:34:24,368
呼んでる気がしたんだ
I felt like I was being called

359
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:29,168
震え出す
Starting to tremble

360
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:33,768
今この時が見つけた気がした
I felt like I found this moment right now

361
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:38,868
失われた記憶が
Memories that were lost

362
00:34:38,968 --> 00:34:42,468
呼び覚ました
Have been awakened

363
00:34:42,868 --> 00:34:45,868
物語
A story

364
00:34:45,968 --> 00:34:49,068
永遠の
Of an eternal

365
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:52,868
その終わり
Conclusion

366
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:56,768
いつの間にか
Before I knew it

367
00:34:56,868 --> 00:35:00,168
駆け出してた
I started running

368
00:35:00,368 --> 00:35:00,684
あなたに手を
To your hand

369
00:35:02,756 --> 00:35:06,856
目覚めてきた...
I woke up...

370
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:10,156
昨日は遠く
Yesterday is far away

371
00:35:10,156 --> 00:35:13,256
明日はすぐ
Tomorrow is coming soon

372
00:35:13,256 --> 00:35:17,656
そんな当たり前に
In such a natural way

373
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:25,356
心が躍った
My heart leaped

374
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:33,956
聞こえた気がした 感じた気がしたんだ
I felt like I heard it, I felt like I sensed it

375
00:35:33,956 --> 00:35:38,156
震えだす 今この胸で
Starting to tremble, now in this chest

376
00:35:38,156 --> 00:35:41,856
もう来る気がした
I felt it was already coming

377
00:35:41,856 --> 00:35:46,456
幾千万の朝を越え
Crossing through millions of mornings

378
00:35:46,456 --> 00:35:51,556
新しい陽が
A new sun

379
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:55,056
待ってる気がした
I felt like it was waiting

380
00:35:55,056 --> 00:36:01,056
呼んでる気がしたんだ
I felt like it was calling out

381
00:36:01,056 --> 00:36:05,956
震えてるこの魂が
This trembling soul

382
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:09,356
見つけた気がした
I felt like I found it

383
00:36:09,356 --> 00:36:12,856
幾億の夢のように
Like hundreds of millions of dreams

384
00:36:12,856 --> 00:36:16,856
消え去る日を
The day it disappears

385
00:36:16,856 --> 00:36:19,556
見送った
I saw it off

386
00:36:19,556 --> 00:36:22,856
手を振った
I waved my hand

387
00:36:22,856 --> 00:36:26,756
ありがとうと
Saying thank you

388
00:36:52,756 --> 00:36:56,756
Kronk! Kronnichiwa!

389
00:36:57,356 --> 00:37:00,356
Domo, Shammidesshu.

390
00:37:00,756 --> 00:37:04,056
Yah yah yah! Domo, Shammidesshu.

391
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,956
Is that what I really sound like?

392
00:37:05,956 --> 00:37:07,556
Yes, you do.

393
00:37:07,856 --> 00:37:09,556
Um... okay...

394
00:37:09,556 --> 00:37:11,256
I've done some improvising, but still...

395
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:12,756
I was expecting a little...

396
00:37:12,756 --> 00:37:16,156
I was expecting a little bit of hesitation, but I guess...

397
00:37:16,156 --> 00:37:19,056
Oh, improvising, so you're adding to it.

398
00:37:19,056 --> 00:37:23,256
Yes. Shammidesshu. Shammidesshu. Oh! Ooh!

399
00:37:24,756 --> 00:37:26,456
Thank you for...

400
00:37:26,456 --> 00:37:27,456
Alright!

401
00:37:27,456 --> 00:37:31,156
Thanks for coming and singing with me today, Kronii.

402
00:37:31,156 --> 00:37:33,256
Oh, no, thank you!

403
00:37:33,256 --> 00:37:35,156
Thank you!

404
00:37:35,156 --> 00:37:38,556
You're looking mighty magnificent in your...

405
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,156
...how would I say...

406
00:37:40,156 --> 00:37:42,656
...cardboard.

407
00:37:42,656 --> 00:37:44,056
Cardboard.

408
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:46,956
Still taller than you though.

409
00:37:46,956 --> 00:37:48,056
Oh, I see.

410
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:51,056
Yeah, like you need some growing up to do, literally.

411
00:37:51,056 --> 00:37:54,256
Hey! You're like 95% legs, okay?

412
00:37:56,756 --> 00:38:01,256
But you came out like that. All legs.

413
00:38:01,256 --> 00:38:06,956
95% legs, 5%... okay, you don't have to go that hard.

414
00:38:06,956 --> 00:38:07,856
Anyway.

415
00:38:07,856 --> 00:38:08,956
Okay, spider-cat!

416
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:10,156
Woah!

417
00:38:10,156 --> 00:38:11,856
Oh my god!

418
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,456
My feelings!

419
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:16,456
What are you going to do with those weapons? Shish-kebab me?

420
00:38:16,456 --> 00:38:19,356
Uh... it's not worth it.

421
00:38:19,356 --> 00:38:23,656
But your shrimp friends over there look pretty tasty.

422
00:38:23,656 --> 00:38:25,556
I might skewer them.

423
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:28,256
Ay, leave some for me if you do.

424
00:38:30,456 --> 00:38:31,856
Say though...

425
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:34,256
How do I... what do I...

426
00:38:34,256 --> 00:38:36,956
...compost or recycle you right now?

427
00:38:36,956 --> 00:38:38,856
Uh, well, you can't.

428
00:38:38,856 --> 00:38:42,656
Uh, you gotta add me... uh, to the Kronii Temple.

429
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:45,256
Kind of add it as a limited edition kind of thing.

430
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:48,056
Right, right, mhm.

431
00:38:48,056 --> 00:38:51,156
Well, what if I just hoist you right here?

432
00:38:51,156 --> 00:38:52,856
Wait, what? Wait, what? Wait...

433
00:38:52,856 --> 00:38:56,756
And I take you to whatever I find first. Compost? Recycle?

434
00:38:56,756 --> 00:38:58,956
Maybe I'll just put you in my room.

435
00:38:58,956 --> 00:39:01,756
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah...

436
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,256
Wait!

437
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:17,556
ピョン ピョン ピョン ピョン ピョン ピョン!
Pyon pyon pyon pyon pyon pyon!

438
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:22,156
皆さん、ありがとうございます！
Everyone, thank you so much!

439
00:39:22,156 --> 00:39:25,656
Thank you guys for watching!

440
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:29,756
I hope you enjoyed what we prepared for you!

441
00:39:29,756 --> 00:39:34,156
Thank you to my wonderful senpai for singing with me...

442
00:39:34,156 --> 00:39:38,756
...and Kroni-shuki Shammidesshu.

443
00:39:38,756 --> 00:39:45,556
Ah, I felt tears welling in my eyes every day I practiced for today.

444
00:39:45,556 --> 00:39:50,056
This concert has been one of my dreams come true...

445
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:55,756
...and it's all possible thanks to each and every one of you.

446
00:39:55,756 --> 00:40:01,456
最初からサポートしてくれてありがとうございます。
Thank you for supporting me from the beginning.

447
00:40:01,456 --> 00:40:02,556
Hololive English, Gawr Guraでした！
It was Gawr Gura from Hololive English!

448
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:03,097
そばにいられて...
Being by your side...

449
00:40:03,097 --> 00:40:08,197
みんなの前で踊ったり歌ったりできた夢みたいです。
being able to dance and sing in front of everyone, it feels like a dream.

450
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:12,897
またいつかみんなの前でライブに立ちたいです。
I want to stand on the live stage in front of everyone again someday.

451
00:40:13,297 --> 00:40:18,897
その日まで目を閉じてみんなの素敵な顔を想像します。
Until that day, I'll close my eyes and imagine all of your wonderful faces.

452
00:40:20,097 --> 00:40:21,097
Now,

453
00:40:21,097 --> 00:40:24,897
one more song before we end today.

454
00:40:26,097 --> 00:40:28,097
いくよー！
Here we go!

455
00:40:38,497 --> 00:40:41,097
好きになって！もっと！
Love me! More!

456
00:40:41,097 --> 00:40:43,997
私を見て！もっと！
Look at me! More!

457
00:40:44,697 --> 00:40:47,197
恩返しは...
My payback is...

458
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:51,697
愛のこもった投げキッスで
with a blown kiss full of love

459
00:40:54,497 --> 00:40:56,697
気のせいじゃない
It's not your imagination

460
00:40:56,697 --> 00:40:59,097
目は合ってるよ
Our eyes are meeting

461
00:40:59,897 --> 00:41:01,997
あとちょっとで
Just a little more

462
00:41:01,997 --> 00:41:04,897
恋しちゃってください
Please fall in love with me

463
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:08,097
やれること
The things I can do

464
00:41:08,097 --> 00:41:10,497
何でもします
I'll do anything

465
00:41:10,797 --> 00:41:12,897
NGなしで
With no "No-Go's"

466
00:41:12,897 --> 00:41:15,297
体当たり挑戦
Trying my best with everything

467
00:41:15,897 --> 00:41:18,497
エゴサで見つけたアンチのコメも
Even the anti-comments I found while searching myself

468
00:41:18,497 --> 00:41:21,097
ぶっちゃけみんなより分かってるし
To be honest, I know them better than anyone

469
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:23,497
でも大丈夫　ここに立てば
But it's okay, if I stand here

470
00:41:23,497 --> 00:41:26,097
みんながいる
Everyone is here

471
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:27,497
いくよ！
Here we go!

472
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:29,797

私を見て！もっと！
Look at me! More!

474
00:41:32,697 --> 00:41:34,897
恩返しは...
My payback is...

475
00:41:34,897 --> 00:41:38,097
愛のこもった投げキッスで
with a blown kiss full of love

476
00:41:38,097 --> 00:41:40,297
虜にする！もっと！
I'll captivate you! More!

477

479
00:41:45,897 --> 00:41:49,497

A special night full of love

484
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:18,097
卒業だなんてまだ早いけど
It's too early to talk about graduation

485
00:42:18,697 --> 00:42:20,897
裏切りません
I won't betray you

486
00:42:20,897 --> 00:42:23,497
宣言しときます
I'll declare it now

487
00:42:23,697 --> 00:42:26,297
口先だけじゃ説得力ない
Lip service isn't persuasive

488
00:42:26,297 --> 00:42:29,097
ぶっちゃけ実力で勝ってやる
To be honest, I'll win with my own skills

489
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,697
だからやめない　負けず嫌い
So I won't quit, I hate to lose

My payback is...

495
00:42:43,097 --> 00:42:46,497
愛のこもったサメビームで
with a shark beam full of love

大歓声！もっと！
Loud cheers! More!

497
00:42:48,697 --> 00:42:51,697

Please accept it

499
00:42:54,097 --> 00:42:57,897

A selfish song full of love

500
00:42:57,897 --> 00:43:00,497
ファンサしちゃうぞ(・ω＜)
I'm gonna give you some fan service! (・ω＜)

501
00:43:05,897 --> 00:43:10,497
近づく寂しさに
To the loneliness drawing near...

502
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:15,497
楽しいのに泣きそうだよ
even though it's fun, I feel like crying

503
00:43:15,897 --> 00:43:17,897
次も
Next time

504
00:43:17,897 --> 00:43:20,897
次もまた会えるよね
we can meet again next time too, right?

505
00:43:21,497 --> 00:43:23,697
約束！
Promise!

506
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:35,297
優しさに溢れている言葉
The words overflowing with kindness,

507
00:43:35,297 --> 00:43:37,697
怒鳴り散らす誰かの言葉も
even the words of someone shouting,

508
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:40,097
必要なんだ　必要なんだ
they're necessary, they're necessary.

509
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:42,497
強くなろう
Let's become strong.

00:43:54,497 --> 00:43:56,897
共に歌おう　ずっと！
Let's sing together, forever!

515
00:43:56,897 --> 00:43:59,297
共に歩もう　ずっと！
Let's walk together, forever!

516
00:43:59,897 --> 00:44:02,297
合言葉はとびっきりの
The password is the best

517
00:44:02,697 --> 00:44:05,097
