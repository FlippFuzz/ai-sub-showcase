2
00:00:00,001 --> 00:03:42,000
birthday!

3
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,000
Aah... aah...

4
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,800
Hello everybody!

5
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,500
Hi, can you hear me?

6
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Can you hear me?

7
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,500
Can you hear me?

8
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,500
Hello!

9
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,500
聞こえますか？
Can you hear me?

10
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,500
You can! You're reacting like you can hear me. Hello!

11
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,200
Oh hey! Oh hey! Not funny seeing you here, huh?

12
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,200
Funny seeing me here, hmm? Ha!

13
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,500
Happy birthday Gura. Thank you!

14
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,000
That's right, today is my birthday.

15
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,500
My 9,000-bazillionth birthday.

16
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Wow, you guys, thank you!

17
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
Happy birthday Goomba. Thank you!

18
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,500
Happy birthday... Can't hear you.

19
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,000
Are you lying to me?

20
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay. No, how would you be lying to me? Because...

21
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,800
Well anyway... well anyway, I hope you can hear me.

22
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,500
Happy birthday Gura.

23
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,500
Wow, look at that sea of green!

24
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,000
Wow, look at all the green!

25
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,000
皆さんありがとうございます！
Thank you everyone!

26
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,500
Oh wow! I wish we could change the color.

27
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
Imagine if we could change that to a sea of blue instead of a sea of green.

28
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,000
That would be a lot... uh... well, more aesthetically pleasing... uh... for me...

29
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,000
...but I guess maybe not for everybody.

30
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,500
I'm sure Fauna really likes it when it's green instead of blue, but I don't know.

31
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
Fauna's cute.

32
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,000
Um... WOW!

33
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,000
Stop!

34
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:06,133
すごい！
Sugoi!

35
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:08,233
Um... I'm nervous again,

36
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:09,833
but what is new?

37
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,433
You thought that was over,

38
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:12,633
but it's not.

39
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:15,833
I'm still incredibly nervous sitting here in my fish tube.

40
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:17,833
Actually I was thinking about it...

41
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,833
...me and this fish tube that I'm right here in, you know?

42
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,833
What if it's actually like just the very large intestine

43
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,233
of a much larger fish?

44
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:28,033
Um... mm. Mm.

45
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:30,533
That could potentially,

46
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,533
that could potentially be what the situation is.

47
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,833
What if we all are just in the large intestine

48
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,033
of a much larger fish on the Earth?

49
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:38,533
Like a meatball?

50
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:40,533
Never mind, we don't have to talk about this anyway.

51
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:41,833
Thank you guys so much!

52
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:42,833
Thank you!

53
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,533
Thank you, thank you, everyone!

54
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:47,233
I've been watching all of your, uh,

55
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:49,033
birthday fan arts coming in, you guys.

56
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:50,833
Thank you, uh, so much.

57
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,233
I really appreciate, uh, what everybody's been sending in.

58
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:55,333
I saw the bus!

59
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,233
The Gura bus!

60
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:57,633
It's been the Gumbo bus!

61
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:59,233
Did you guys ride in the Gumbo bus?

62
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,633
Did you get to sit inside the Gargura bus?

63
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:04,833
Fill it with gas!

64
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:12,233
Nyooooon~

65
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:15,233
Anyway, it's really hard to see what you guys are saying

66
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:18,533
'cause there's just so much bup-bup-bup-bup-bup,

67
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:21,233
which I appreciate, but um... anyway.

68
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:22,533
Um, can you guys hear me though?

69
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:23,433
Okay, you can hear me.

70
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:25,533
We bussin'. We are bussin'. We are fish-like.

71
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,233
Do you think we could... well, never mind.

72
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:30,533
I was gonna... never mind. We don't have to go that route.

73
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:32,433
Um... what?

74
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,033
There's a Gura bus. There's a Gura bus.

75
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:35,533
And I saw videos!

76
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:37,833
There's a bunch of videos you guys...

77
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,833
...some animations as well.

78
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,233
Um, I want to say thank you for making me feel,

79
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:45,233
uh, so special on my very special day.

80
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:48,233
Very, very special day.

81
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,833
What? Is the mic okay?

82
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:57,833
The mic is, is it peaking?

83
00:06:58,533 --> 00:06:59,833
Hello? Hello?

84
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,033
What is wrong with the mic?

85
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,533
Can you...?

86
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:08,233
Mic is acting funny. Oh, great.

87
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:11,433
Um, well, as you guys probably know...

88
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:14,233
well, situation...

89
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,533
...I'm a little out of my element at the moment,

90
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:19,833
so I would appreciate... Mic is peaking.

91
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:24,233
A-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!

92
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:26,533
I see. I see what you mean.

93
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,833
Why is it doing that? I don't know why it's doing that.

94
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:33,233
Uh, I'll try not to overwhelm the microphone.

95
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,833
I will speak softer.

96
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,233
Mmm.

97
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:42,233
Okay, so um...

98
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:45,233
I hope you guys liked the streams yesterday.

99
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:47,833
They were a lot of fun. Um, yeah,

100
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:51,033
that was a lot of fun.

101
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,233
Actually, uh, it's still kind of sinking in

102
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:54,833
what happened.

103
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,833
Um, so... Oh, I'm...

104
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,533
Real bad Gura.

105
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,233
What do you mean 'real bad Gura'?

106
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,233
Did you like that?

107
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,233
Yeah, the karaoke was a lot of fun.

108
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:16,033
I don't know how much I should say about it, though.

109
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:19,033
Of course, I'm like absolutely, uh,

110
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:22,233
filled to the brim with stuff that I want to talk about,

111
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:24,233
uh, what Ame did.

112
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:30,033
Uh, so, uh, yeah, she made me,

113
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:31,233
she made me a little cake...

114
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:34,533
...and she decorated it with white chocolate,

115
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,833
and she made little, like, sea creatures,

116
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,233
and she stuck it to the cake.

117
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:41,833
Um, and the cake had, had coffee in it...

118
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,233
...so after I ate it, uh, I got really energized

119
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,833
'cause there was like espresso in it.

120
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,833
And um... it really helped...

121
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,533
...I don't know, it helped me to stay awake...

122
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,833
...so I could see everything

123
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,833
that you guys were sending me on Twitter

124
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,033
with the hashtag, the birthday hashtag.

125
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:03,033
Um, what else did we do?

126
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,533
Oh, she made me dinner!

127
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,233
Yeah, she made me, she made me dinner.

128
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,233
She made me, uh... we had steak and rice

129
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:13,233
and, and broccoli... fancy broccoli. Fancy broccoli.

130
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,233
But I eat really slow.

131
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:18,033
Um, I was kind of self-conscious about that,

132
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:20,233
but um... it's okay.

133
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,033
She eats slow, too.

134
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:24,233
She's not gonna tell you that,

135
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:26,233
but she eats pretty slow too.

136
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,833
All right. All right.

137
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,233
And Watson eats her rice with soy sauce!

138
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:32,233
Did you know that?

139
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,833
I prefer my rice plain, uh, just hot steamed rice,

140
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,833
plain, nothing on it.

141
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,233
But Watson likes to eat her rice with soy sauce.

142
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,833
Just a little thing. Did you know that? Hmm?

143
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,033
A slow-eater competition?

144
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:46,033
Well, I was anxious, but also I do eat slowly.

145
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:47,233
It's not a bad thing, is it?

146
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,833
Do you guys eat fast or slow?

147
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,833
Wait, why am I doing...? Never mind.

148
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,033
I'm talking to myself.

149
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:54,833
Soy sauce is pretty good.

150
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,233
It is good, but the problem when you pour soy sauce

151
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:59,833
on rice is that it makes it unsticky.

152
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,033
So then you can't eat it very easily.

153
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:04,833
So you have to eat it with like a spoon and a straw

154
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,833
or something, whatever you choose.

155
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:07,553
Sweet or salty?

156
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,178
It was soy sauce, I don't know, it's just soy sauce.

157
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:05,078
It was just soy sauce.

158
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:06,478
It was just soy sauce.

159
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:12,078
If you guys eat fast food, don't you get like, I don't know, indigestion or something?

160
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:20,478
Anyway, though... I'll talk a bit more about the hanging out with Watson later.

161
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:28,478
But first, I... as being my birthday in Gura birthday tradition...

162
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:31,378
I have a gift for you guys.

163
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:33,478
A gift for all of you.

164
00:10:34,978 --> 00:10:37,478
You might guess what it is, but anyway...

165
00:10:38,978 --> 00:10:50,978
So for all of you, I prepared a little something with the help of a very, very, very, very, very awesome artist that I really look up to a lot.

166
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:56,978
Is it more streams? Yes, but yes but no, but yes, but not right now.

167
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:02,978
So I have for you...

168
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:07,478
Ahhhhhhhhhh... tada!

169
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:09,478
Oh dear.

170
00:11:11,478 --> 00:11:12,978
Tada!

171
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:14,278
Emotes!

172
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:16,978
New emotes!

173
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:23,978
And see the cool thing about this is all of my... do you see the shrimp emotes? We have Ebi emotes now.

174
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:30,478
We have now forever, what is it? Immortalized Ebis in the emote list.

175
00:11:31,978 --> 00:11:33,978
Let's take a look. These are by Mariette.

176
00:11:34,978 --> 00:11:36,978
Mariette.

177
00:11:37,978 --> 00:11:39,978
We have... what do we have here?

178
00:11:40,978 --> 00:11:51,478
Gura with a penlight that looks like a gun. That's actually, I specifically asked, I said "Can you make Gura look like... can you make me look like I'm holding a gun, but instead of a gun, it's a penlight?"

179
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,078
And then we have Nyoom!

180
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:54,478
And then we have celebration!

181
00:11:55,478 --> 00:11:56,278
And then we have comfy Gura!

182
00:11:57,178 --> 00:11:58,278
And then we have Gura is dead!

183
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,178
And then we have Gura is crying happy!

184
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:05,078
And then we have Gura... Gura is smiling at you, very smug!

185
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:08,078
And then we have squish the cheek of Gura!

186
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,078
And then we have Gura scared!

187
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:12,078
And then we have Giga Gura Chad!

188
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:15,478
And then we have Gura going "Hehehe!"

189
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:18,178
And then we have my face, because you guys are always looking at me funny.

190
00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:20,478
And then we have Gura "Haha!"

191
00:12:21,178 --> 00:12:22,378
And then we have Gura eyeball!

192
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:25,478
And then we have Ebi... Ebi-chan!

193
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:31,478
You guys are holding penlights. You guys are looking at me like I probably just said something really awful and I don't realize it.

194
00:12:32,478 --> 00:12:38,478
And then you're crying, and then your little face is like that when you say something stupid and don't realize it and I call you out. See?

195
00:12:39,978 --> 00:12:41,478
Yay!

196
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:44,478
Okay you should be able to use them now. Can use them now.

197
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:45,978
There they are. Nice!

198
00:12:47,178 --> 00:12:49,478
Excellent!

199
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:55,478
Look at all these Gura Chads. Giga Gura Chads!

200
00:12:56,478 --> 00:13:00,478
Wow, what excellent jawlines you guys have. Wow!

201
00:13:02,478 --> 00:13:05,478
Nice jawbones, guys!

202
00:13:06,478 --> 00:13:09,478
Ebi looks like Patrick, like Patrick Star.

203
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:11,478
Ebi cute. Ebi-chan cute.

204
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:14,978
You guys really like the Giga Chad one.

205
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:22,478
I guess it's not Giga Chad anymore, I guess it's now Gura Chad when you're here. Gura Chad. Gura Chad.

206
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:23,978
Oh, they're so cute.

207
00:13:24,478 --> 00:13:32,478
This is the same artist that drew Mumei as well as Fauna's emotes, and I really, really like both of their emotes.

208
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:42,478
I use them a lot, in the Discord especially. I'm always using Fauna Zoom, Fauna "Not like this", and Clover, and then Mumei's loading face, I always use that one.

209
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:47,978
So I was really excited to be able to get Mariette to help me out with these new emotes. Thank you Mariette if you're watching!

210
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,478
Thank you! Thank you, thank you!

211
00:13:52,978 --> 00:13:54,178
Phew!

212
00:13:54,978 --> 00:13:55,978
Mwah!

213
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:57,978
Okay.

214
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:11,478
This year I wanted to do something a little bit different than what we're, I guess, what I'm used to doing for birthdays.

215
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:16,978
Or I mean, I've only had one birthday, but I wanted to change it up a little bit this year.

216
00:14:17,978 --> 00:14:19,978
You can't find Ebi? エビちゃんどこ？
You can't find Ebi? Where's Ebi-chan?

217
00:14:21,978 --> 00:14:29,478
Maybe there's an issue with Ebi. Ebi-chan. Ebi-chan is coming. I was wondering why I couldn't see Ebi anywhere. Ebi.

218
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:36,478
I'm sure Ebi is coming. I'm sure Management is helping right now to make sure Ebi's working. No worries, Ebi coming.

219
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,478
Maybe also refresh your page, that might be it.

220
00:14:41,978 --> 00:14:43,978
But anyway, I want to talk about something that's going to happen.

221
00:14:45,478 --> 00:14:52,978
I wanted to do some stuff a little bit differently this year, but I still hope that you guys will like it.

222
00:14:53,478 --> 00:15:02,978
It took a lot of creative minds and patience and a lot of helping hands to make...

223
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:05,136
This, this, this year's birthday turned into something...

224
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:08,436
...I think is really great, and I'm really...

225
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:11,936
...excited for, and I'm ble-ble-ble... I'm saying so much.

226
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:15,436
So, so, so, so, how old am I now?

227
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:18,736
Oh God, how many times have I answered this question?

228
00:15:18,736 --> 00:15:21,436
So many, so many times.

229
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:24,936
Please not Dakimakura. You don't want a Dakimakura.

230
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:28,436
That's right, there's merchandise. Merchandise releases today.

231
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:31,936
Are you excited? I'm really excited.

232
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:35,436
I showed one of the other Myth members the merchandise...

233
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:38,936
...and she really liked it, so I hope you guys...

234
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:41,936
...really like it as well.

235
00:15:50,436 --> 00:15:53,936
Okay, anyway, let's go and...

236
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:57,936
...I didn't think of how to segue this at all whatsoever.

237
00:15:57,936 --> 00:16:01,936
Can you tell that I'm nervous? Where's the shrimp emote?

238
00:16:01,936 --> 00:16:05,936
I don't know. It should be coming anytime though.

239
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:10,436
I need to... hold on, I need to gather my thoughts. I'm really shaking right now. Hmm.

240
00:16:14,936 --> 00:16:18,936
The personality test that I took said that I do really well under pressure.

241
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,936
And I think I do okay under pressure, but maybe not productively well.

242
00:16:22,936 --> 00:16:26,936
I just keep my cool, sort of. I think I keep my cool.

243
00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:30,436
Mike is funky. It'll fix in a second, it's just suffering right now.

244
00:16:30,436 --> 00:16:33,936
But anyway, I want to sing some songs for you.

245
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:37,936
I want to, I want to sing some music. That's, that I know how to do.

246
00:16:37,936 --> 00:16:42,936
I'll do that for you guys because that'll help calm me down and stuff.

247
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:45,936
There, Ebi! Oh, you look so good! Look at!

248
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:53,936
Oh wow! Ebi! Hello, everyone! Cute!

249
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:02,936
Ah, looks so good! Yeah! Okay, so yeah...

250
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:06,936
I want to, I want to sing for you today because that's what I, I like to do.

251
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:11,436
It is an activity like we that we both like sharing in, right you guys?

252
00:17:11,436 --> 00:17:15,436
So, but we're going to switch it up and I'm I hope you...

253
00:17:15,436 --> 00:17:19,436
...I hope we have a good time today, okay? Be ready to shake those penlights.

254
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:22,436
Yeah. Okay. Shall we? 行くぞ！

Everyone, okay, okay. P-p-p-p-p-p... ah...

257
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:53,436
Close your eyes, everybody. Close them.

258
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:58,436
Or don't close them. Okay, yeah, close them now. Close.

259
00:18:50,936 --> 00:18:53,936
So much blue. It makes my heart so happy.

260
00:18:53,936 --> 00:18:58,436
I love the color blue. Did you know that? Okay, anyway...

261
00:18:58,436 --> 00:19:01,936
Look at the big aquarium! Wow! Fishies! Fishy, fishy!

262
00:19:01,936 --> 00:19:05,936
And look at the floor. It's water. Water.

263
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:10,436
Swish, splash. And look at me! That's right, I'm here too.

264
00:19:10,436 --> 00:19:14,436
Look at me! I'm here! You're here! We're here!

265
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:19,436
To party! Yahoo! パチパチパチ！
To party! Yahoo! *Clap clap clap!*

266
00:19:19,436 --> 00:19:22,936
But first, I just want to say a big thank you to you guys...

267
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:26,436
...to everybody. Thank you, thank you for supporting Shark...

268
00:19:26,436 --> 00:19:29,936
...and believing in Shark. Just Sharky. Little Sharky.

269
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:33,936
All of this for little Sharky. That's so crazy.

270
00:19:33,936 --> 00:19:37,936
Thank you guys so much! Ah!

271
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:42,936
We also recently hit four bubuillion subscribers...
We also recently hit four million subscribers...

272
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:46,936
...which is insanity. Also, I did some math...

273
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:02,888
Yeah, I know. Gura doing math.

274
00:20:02,888 --> 00:20:04,388
Look out!

275
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:08,288
But roughly there are 15 shrimp to 1 pound.

276
00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:12,588
So that technically means that with 4 million shrimp...

277
00:20:13,888 --> 00:20:15,888
Something... something...

278
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:20,288
There's a big shrimp lurking on the horizon is what I'm trying to say.

279
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:23,388
And he's made up of millions. 4 million little tiny nano shrimpy's.

280
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,988
That's all of you, you are building the giga shrimp.

281
00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:33,288
So we must be wary and look out for this very large specimen.

282
00:20:33,488 --> 00:20:35,688
Um, you can do the exact math though.

283
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:39,088
'Cause I actually don't know how big this giga shrimp is.

284
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:41,888
Giga? Mega? Mega shrimp.

285
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:44,788
I think I'm gonna stop myself here though.

286
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:46,188
But anyways...

287
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:52,388
Er... ooh boob boob boob...

288
00:20:53,088 --> 00:20:56,788
Okay. We all know that I cannot do math.

289
00:20:57,388 --> 00:21:00,688
But I propose a counter-offer.

290
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:02,288
Huh?

291
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,288
You do the math.

292
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,288
I'll do the sing.

293
00:21:06,888 --> 00:21:08,388
I sing for you.

294
00:21:09,388 --> 00:21:10,788
I sing for you.

295
00:21:11,388 --> 00:21:12,088
Hehe.

296
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,288
Do... I'll...

297
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:15,188
Okay. Um...

298
00:21:15,388 --> 00:21:18,188
I'd better start before it gets too awkward.

299
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:19,288
Okay.

00:21:19,388 --> 00:21:21,888

I'll take a mouthful of slumber

00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:27,766
Tatsuro... Tatsuro Yamashita will forever be

350
00:25:27,766 --> 00:25:31,266
one of my favorite musical artists.

351
00:25:31,266 --> 00:25:35,766
Seriously. I can always find a way to

352
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:39,466
recommend people to listen to his music.

353
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:42,066
Wait, Gooba... Gooba, I don't know what to stream...

354
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:45,466
Oh, that sucks. Hey, have you heard this banger before?

355
00:25:45,466 --> 00:25:50,066
Send link, send link, link, link, link...

356
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:53,766
I mean, I've already told you guys about

357
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:56,466
how much I enjoy Tatsuro Yamashita's music so...

358
00:25:56,466 --> 00:25:59,766
So, you guys already know.

359
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:03,066
Actually, lately, my summer playlist has consisted of

360
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:07,766
Tatsuro Yamashita, various albums, uh,

361
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,766
and then Jeremy Soule as well.

362
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:14,466
I have like two modes right now.

363
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:18,766
It's either nostalgia for a 1980s summer or, or,

364
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:22,266
somewhere in a Skyrim tavern looking to pickpocket.

365
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:24,766
Did you guys smell that?

366
00:26:24,766 --> 00:26:27,766
You smell that? It smells like... no, wait...

367
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:31,266
Nam nam, I can taste it too. It tastes like herbs and spices.

Guys?

393
00:30:20,754 --> 00:30:25,072

I want to see you, I can't see you, it's so painful.

この気持ち 言えないの 言いたいな
I can't say these feelings, but I want to say them.

396
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,490
チャンス 逃してばかり だって
Because I'm always missing my chance.

397

I'm the most, most, most in love!

429
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:40,351
君とのドッペルゲンガー
A doppelganger with you

430
00:34:40,351 --> 00:34:43,859
それは予想通り
It's just as expected

431
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:47,371
いざ始まれば 一人芝居だ
Once it starts, it's a one-man show

432
00:34:47,371 --> 00:34:51,371
ずっと側にいたって 結局ただの観客だ
Even if I'm always by your side, in the end I'm just a spectator

433
00:34:51,818 --> 00:34:55,351
感情のあ、アイムソーリー
Feelings of... ah, I'm sorry

434
00:34:55,351 --> 00:34:58,819
それはいつも通り
It's just as usual

435
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:02,418
慣れてしまえば
Once you get used to it...

436
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,630
言わないけど
I won't say it, but...

437
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,030
君とのロマンスは
The romance with you...

438
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,330
前世から続きはしないことを
...is not something that continues from a past life...

439
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,330
知った
...I've realized.

440
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,330
もっと違う設定で
In a different setting,

441
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,330
もっと違う関係で
In a different relationship,

442
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:22,830
出会える世界線選べたらよかった
I wish I could have chosen a timeline where we met differently.

443
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,330
もっと違う性格で
With a different personality,

444
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,330
もっと違う価値観で
With different values,

445
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:32,330
愛を伝えられたらいいな
I wish I could have conveyed my love.

446
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,330
そう願っても無駄だから
But even if I wish for that, it's useless.

447
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:39,830
グッバイ
Goodbye.

448
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:43,830
君の運命のヒトは僕じゃない
I'm not your soulmate.

449
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,830
辛いけど否めない
It's painful, but I can't deny it.

450
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,630
でも離れ難いのさ
But it's hard to let you go.

451
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,630
その髪に触れただけで
Just by touching your hair,

452
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,630
痛いや　いやでも
It hurts, no, but still,

453
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,030
甘いな　いやいや
It's sweet, no, no.

454
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,630
グッバイ
Goodbye.

455
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:04,330
それじゃ僕にとって君は何？
Then what are you to me?

456
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,630
答えは分からない
I don't know the answer.

457
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,030
分かりたくもないのさ
I don't even want to know.

458
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:14,630
たったひとつ確かなことが
If there's only one thing for certain,

459
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:18,130
あるとするのならば
that's for sure,

460
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,830
「君は綺麗だ」
"You are beautiful."

461
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:32,030
誰かが偉そうに語る恋愛のセオリー
The theories of love that someone talks about so arrogantly,

462
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:36,330
何ひとつとしてピンとこなくて
none of them really click with me.

463
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:45,830
飛行機の窓から見下ろした知らない街の夜景みたいだ
It's like looking down at the night view of an unknown city from an airplane window.

464
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,330
もっと違う設定で
In a different setting,

465
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,330
もっと違う関係で
In a different relationship,

466
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:56,830
出会える世界線選べたらよかった
I wish I could have chosen a timeline where we met differently.

467
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:00,630
いたって純な心で
With a perfectly pure heart,

468
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:04,030
かなった恋を抱きしめて
embracing a love that came true,

469
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:11,330
「好きだ」とか無責任に言えたらいいな
I wish I could irresponsibly say things like "I love you."

470
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,330
グッバイ
Goodbye.

471
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,630
繋いだ手の向こうにエンドライン
An end line beyond our joined hands.

472
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:23,630
引き伸ばすたびに　疼きだす未来には
In the future that begins to ache every time I stretch it out,

473
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:29,330
君はいない　その事実に苦いよ
you are not there. That fact is bitter.

474
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:34,830
いやいや　それ苦しいよな
No, no, that's painful, isn't it?

475
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,830
グッバイ
Goodbye.

476
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:59,030
君の運命のヒトは僕じゃない
I'm not your soulmate.

477
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:02,330
辛いけど否めない
It's painful, but I can't deny it.

478
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:06,330
でも離れ難いのさ
But it's hard to let you go.

479
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,630
その髪に触れただけで
Just by touching your hair,

480
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,630
痛いや　いやでも
It hurts, no, but still,

481
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:15,030
甘いな　いやいや
It's sweet, no, no.

482
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,630
グッバイ
Goodbye.

483
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:20,330
それじゃ僕にとって君は何？
Then what are you to me?

484
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:23,630
答えは分からない
I don't know the answer.

485
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:27,030
分かりたくもないのさ
I don't even want to know.

486
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,630
たったひとつ確かなことが
If there's only one thing for certain,

487
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:34,030
あるとするのならば
that's for sure,

488
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,330
「君は綺麗だ」
"You are beautiful."

489
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:42,330
それもこれもロマンスだね
All of this is romance, too.

490
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,330
悪くないよな
It's not bad, is it?

491
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:53,830
永遠も約束もないけれど
There are no promises of eternity, but...

492
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:59,330
とても綺麗だ
...you are so beautiful.

493
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,830
眠らない夜
A sleepless night,

494
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,830
君のせいだよ
...is all your fault.

495
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,330
さっきばかりね
Just a moment ago,

496
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,330
目が合ったばかりなのに
even though our eyes just met,

497
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,830
耳たぶが熱い
...my earlobes are burning.

498
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:03,642
...for you.

499
00:40:03,642 --> 00:40:07,142
おもいきり... for you.
With all my heart... for you.

500
00:40:10,142 --> 00:40:11,642
やった！
We did it!

501
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:12,642
やった？
We did it?

502
00:40:12,642 --> 00:40:13,642
やったよ！
We did it!

503
00:40:14,142 --> 00:40:18,142
Ah... はじめてのチュウ...
Ah... my first kiss...

504
00:40:18,142 --> 00:40:19,142
チュウ！
Kiss!

505
00:40:19,142 --> 00:40:21,142

506
00:40:21,142 --> 00:40:22,142
チュウ！

507
00:40:22,142 --> 00:40:23,142
チュウ？
Kiss?

508
00:40:23,142 --> 00:40:26,142
I will give you all my love.

509
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:31,642
なぜか優しい気持ちが いっぱい...
For some reason, I'm filled with such a gentle feeling...

510
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:35,642
...はじめてのチュウ...
...my first kiss...

511
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,642
チュウ！君とチュウ...

512
00:40:38,642 --> 00:40:43,142
チュウ！I will give you all my love.
Kiss! I will give you all my love.

513
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:48,142
涙が出ちゃう 男の子だね...
I'm a boy who's about to cry...

514
00:40:48,142 --> 00:40:54,142
...くせに be in love with you.
...even so, I'm in love with you.

515
00:40:57,142 --> 00:41:00,642
Ah, why'd you pick this song? It's embarrassing!

516
00:41:00,642 --> 00:41:03,142
Hey, isn't it blushy-blushy?

517
00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:05,142
Shut it, fish brain!

518
00:41:07,142 --> 00:41:11,642
デートの誘いも もう決めたんだ...
I've already decided how to ask you out on a date...

519
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:20,142

My dreams for tomorrow are expanding...

520
00:41:20,142 --> 00:41:24,142

521
00:41:24,642 --> 00:41:28,642
To you... いつまでも...
To you... forever...

522
00:41:29,142 --> 00:41:31,642
To you...

523
00:41:33,142 --> 00:41:35,142
きっと...
Surely...

524
00:41:35,142 --> 00:41:36,142
きっと...
Surely...

525
00:41:36,142 --> 00:41:37,142

Love with you...

550
00:44:03,142 --> 00:44:04,642
Trick or Treat!

551
00:44:11,142 --> 00:44:17,142
Your oshi's waiting in the closet tonight.
No wait, stop, she's dead-set on giving you a fright!

552
00:44:17,142 --> 00:44:23,642
Trick or treat, but now we're all out of candy.
Feeling just a little sick, this chainsaw'd come in handy!

553
00:44:23,642 --> 00:44:30,142
I got a theory, just possessed.
So let's experiment, a little vivisection is best!

554
00:44:30,142 --> 00:44:36,142
Drop the little babies hiding behind your screen.
Is it even spooky Halloween without some mythical beings?

555
00:44:36,642 --> 00:44:42,642
Death is splashing, look at those red cheeks.

556
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:55,142
I'll fix that after draining all your blood, that's what you see!

557
00:45:00,687 --> 00:45:01,887
Myth or Treat!

558
00:45:01,987 --> 00:45:05,187
Oh, what a cursed five stream

559
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:09,187
There's no bones about it you'll scream

560
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:11,887
We'll only show ya on Halloween

561
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:14,987
Our spookier, terrify-scarier side

562
00:45:15,287 --> 00:45:18,187
Oh, what a ガチ恋 night
Oh, what a Gachi-koi night

563
00:45:18,687 --> 00:45:21,187
Mythic witches with endless fights

564
00:45:21,687 --> 00:45:24,187
Can't escape our idol-less might

565
00:45:24,687 --> 00:45:27,887
No candy inside so your souls must suffice

566
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:30,187
Bust a funky dance tonight

567
00:45:30,487 --> 00:45:31,687
What a spooky scary sight

568
00:45:31,887 --> 00:45:34,187
Hungry dinosaur, just one tiny bite... please!

569
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:36,687
Spook-a-bulous with a song

570
00:45:37,187 --> 00:45:38,687
If you're brave then sing along

571
00:45:38,887 --> 00:45:40,687
Not your wife, I am a pumpkin! Ding dong!

572
00:45:41,187 --> 00:45:42,987
In the graveyard we will be

573
00:45:43,187 --> 00:45:44,487
If you're looking for a scream

574
00:45:44,687 --> 00:45:47,187
Singing songs that make you pee! A-R-T-Y

575
00:45:47,687 --> 00:45:49,687
Give you shivers, make you shout

576
00:45:49,887 --> 00:45:50,687
Just like that now Myth is out

577
00:45:51,187 --> 00:45:54,187
Spookily is what we're about

578
00:46:06,187 --> 00:46:07,187
Ah...

579
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:11,187
I love singing with the other members in Myth. Wah...

580
00:46:11,487 --> 00:46:14,187
Hope you guys liked it too.

581
00:46:14,687 --> 00:46:19,187
I really, really appreciate everybody's hard work to make today happen.

582
00:46:19,687 --> 00:46:21,687
It's a really nice feeling

583
00:46:21,887 --> 00:46:26,187
knowing that I can rely on my friends

584
00:46:26,487 --> 00:46:29,687
and other super creative people to make such fun experiences happen for all of you.

585
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,187
I'm so very grateful.

586
00:46:32,487 --> 00:46:36,187
So thank you, thank you everybody, and also to each of you.

587
00:46:36,487 --> 00:46:40,187
Thank you for your patience and your incredible support.

591

Merchandise baby, merchandise.

595
00:47:05,687 --> 00:47:10,187
Give me the good shark, give me the goods.

596
00:47:10,687 --> 00:47:13,187
I know, I know, I know.

597
00:47:14,187 --> 00:47:16,187
I'm so excited about this year's merch.

598

00:47:22,887 --> 00:47:25,687

616
00:48:06,687 --> 00:48:10,187

00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,687
I don't know, gaming maybe?

631
00:49:03,187 --> 00:49:05,687
I don't know, just don't get it dirty.

632
00:49:06,187 --> 00:49:09,187
Well, you can get it dirty for a while, I mean... it's alright.

00:49:36,187 --> 00:49:39,687
little round yellow toes and scales,

643
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:43,187
and an embroidered えび on the tushy.
and an embroidered Ebi on the tushy.

644
00:49:43,687 --> 00:49:47,187
Designed by none other than... さめあんこ。
Designed by none other than... Sameanko.

645
00:49:47,687 --> 00:49:49,687
Dino Guba!

646
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:51,687
Dino Guba is real.

647
00:49:52,187 --> 00:49:54,687
Dino Guba... you can own a Dino Guba.

648
00:49:55,187 --> 00:49:58,187
Dino Guba can now peacefully live in your home

649
00:49:58,687 --> 00:50:01,687
just for you.

650
00:50:02,187 --> 00:50:05,687
And you can pull the hood down and reveal my twin tails!

651
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:06,097
It smells.

652
00:50:06,164 --> 00:50:06,847
It's squishy.

653
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,064
It's punchable.

654
00:50:08,097 --> 00:50:09,147
It's puntable.

655
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:13,030
And I might have cried when I first saw

656
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:14,297
the plushie design,

657
00:50:14,297 --> 00:50:16,547
because Sama-anko is such a god

658
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:17,814
at creating cute things,

659
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:20,014
designing anything and everything

660
00:50:20,014 --> 00:50:21,347
that's cute.

661
00:50:21,347 --> 00:50:23,247
Sama-anko is number one.

662
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:27,280
I hope you will give Dino Gura

663
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,547
a good home.

664
00:50:29,197 --> 00:50:31,214
Also, while I'm here, can somebody

665
00:50:31,214 --> 00:50:33,147
make the Luigi centrifuge meme video,

666
00:50:33,147 --> 00:50:35,047
but it's like Dino Gura instead?

667
00:50:35,047 --> 00:50:36,130
That would be funny.

668
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,114
Maybe I'll do it. I can do it.

669
00:50:38,297 --> 00:50:40,030
Instead of "Whaaa!", it'll be me,

670
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:42,114
but I'll be doing something else.

671
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:46,197
Ha...

672
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:48,480
We're not done yet!

673
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:51,047
Then we have...

674
00:50:53,747 --> 00:50:56,397
The Gura Bowl!

675
00:50:58,314 --> 00:51:00,414
I am absolutely dead serious when I say

676
00:51:00,414 --> 00:51:02,364
that kitchenware is my weakness.

677
00:51:03,447 --> 00:51:04,980
Also designed by Sama-anko.

678
00:51:06,064 --> 00:51:08,064
The Gura Bowl features me,

679
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:09,314
Ebi-chan, and Bloop

680
00:51:09,314 --> 00:51:11,347
at the very bottom of the bowl,

681
00:51:11,347 --> 00:51:14,014
ensuring that no crumbs are left behind.

682
00:51:16,164 --> 00:51:18,097
Do you see how cute this bowl is?

683
00:51:21,014 --> 00:51:22,097
Look at it.

684
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:27,164
I love kitchenware.

685
00:51:27,164 --> 00:51:28,880
I love kitchenware.

686
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,264
Kitchenware daisuki!
I love kitchenware!

687
00:51:31,264 --> 00:51:32,880
In fact, I want more.

688
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,330
I need a Myth dinnerware set.

689
00:51:36,047 --> 00:51:38,030
I need bowls, I need plates,

690
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,197
I need cups. We have cups.

691
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:42,147
Well, now I need the rest of it.

692
00:51:42,147 --> 00:51:43,830
We need bowls.

693
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,347
More bowls, I say.

694
00:51:45,347 --> 00:51:47,214
Give me more bowls, please.

695
00:51:47,214 --> 00:51:48,964
I won't even use them.

696
00:51:48,964 --> 00:51:51,047
I just want to look at them.

697
00:51:51,047 --> 00:51:52,130
Just let me look at them.

698
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:53,164
Oh my god.

699
00:51:54,747 --> 00:51:56,064
Well, there's more.

700
00:51:56,064 --> 00:51:57,197
There's more, guys.

701
00:51:58,147 --> 00:52:00,164
To go alongside your very own

702
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:01,230
Gura Bowl...

703
00:52:15,114 --> 00:52:16,564
Trident fork!

704
00:52:16,564 --> 00:52:17,864
Trident chopsticks!

705
00:52:17,864 --> 00:52:20,247
I repeat: Trident fork!

706
00:52:20,247 --> 00:52:21,564
Trident chopsticks!

707
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,147
It's blue! Well, turquoise.

708
00:52:24,147 --> 00:52:26,147
Blue! Turquoise blue!

709
00:52:27,114 --> 00:52:29,180
I've talked to you guys about how much

710
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,097
I wanted to make a trident fork.

711
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,247
Okay, I wanted it to be glowing.

712
00:52:34,247 --> 00:52:37,130
This one doesn't glow, but still...

713
00:52:42,097 --> 00:52:43,064
Look at it.

714
00:52:45,114 --> 00:52:47,247
Trident cutlery set!

715
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,214
Holy moly motherload!

716
00:52:49,747 --> 00:52:51,830
Trident fork and chopsticks set.

717
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:53,747
Designed by yours truly.

718
00:52:53,747 --> 00:52:56,047
That's right, I designed it

719
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,030
because we talked about it, remember?

720
00:52:59,114 --> 00:53:01,230
Not quite as powerful as my own trident,

721
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:04,830
but definitely strong enough to lift

722
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:06,064
your favorite meal into your mouth.

723
00:53:06,064 --> 00:53:08,880
Lift your favorite meal out of

724
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,130
the Gura Bowl and into your mouth.

725
00:53:13,247 --> 00:53:15,847
Okay, and lastly... a voice pack!

726
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,864
Featuring some notification sounds

727
00:53:21,864 --> 00:53:23,880
that you can use in whichever device

728
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,064
you wish to Gura-fy.

729
00:53:25,064 --> 00:53:27,230
Your PC, your phone,

730
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:28,880
your iPads, your iDevices.

731
00:53:29,847 --> 00:53:31,064
Can I say iPad on stream?

732
00:53:31,064 --> 00:53:32,130
I just said iPad.

733
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:35,097
Any device that you would like

734
00:53:35,097 --> 00:53:36,830
my voice coming out of, except...

735
00:53:37,264 --> 00:53:38,864
audio thing. Woohoo!

736
00:53:39,064 --> 00:53:40,247
Gura! Woohoo!

737
00:53:42,114 --> 00:53:45,064
Now, okay, I will say that there are

738
00:53:45,064 --> 00:53:46,880
more things in the oven currently,

739
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,097
but they need a bit more time.

740
00:53:49,097 --> 00:53:50,097
Just a bit.

741
00:53:51,114 --> 00:53:53,847
And I hope you look forward to

742
00:53:53,847 --> 00:53:55,030
what I'm cooking up.

743
00:53:57,047 --> 00:53:58,980
Motivado, minna-san! Tweet!
Motivated, everyone! Tweet!

744
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,880
Thank you guys for coming

745
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,830
to my birthday party this year.

746
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:10,064
I hope you had a nice time.

747
00:54:10,064 --> 00:54:11,880
I hope you like the goods.

748
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,064
I hope you like the songs.

749
00:54:13,064 --> 00:54:15,230
Thank you, Myth, for singing with me

750
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:17,230
and for hanging out with me

751
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:18,130
on my birthday.

752
00:54:19,114 --> 00:54:21,230
I'm very lucky to be surrounded by

753
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:23,230
such a talented group of ladies.

754
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:25,980
And I appreciate and cherish every moment

755
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,230
that we've been able to spend together

756
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,847
on this Hololive journey.

757
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,064
Thank you to you guys as well

758
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:36,130
watching this journey.

759
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:38,147
Let's see where we go next, right?

760
00:54:38,147 --> 00:54:39,264
GG, good next stop!

761
00:54:41,247 --> 00:54:43,830
皆さん、ありがとうございました。
Thank you, everyone.

762
00:54:45,114 --> 00:54:47,247
これからも頑張りますので、
I'll continue to do my best,

763
00:54:49,247 --> 00:54:52,097
よろしくお願いします。
so please keep supporting me.

764
00:54:53,114 --> 00:54:54,147
Okay.

765
00:54:54,147 --> 00:54:55,847
It is time for me to go.

766
00:54:56,064 --> 00:54:58,097
But I'll see you again real soon, okay?

767
00:54:59,097 --> 00:55:01,064
Okie-dokie, everybody!

768
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:03,047
Bye-bye!

769
00:55:04,304 --> 00:55:05,138
Bye everybody.

770
00:55:06,339 --> 00:55:08,441
Bye-bye, bye-bye!

771
00:55:09,308 --> 00:55:11,076
Bye-bye, bye-bye!

772
00:55:12,245 --> 00:55:14,180
Bye-bye, bye!

773
00:55:14,881 --> 00:55:16,349
Bye-bye-bye...
