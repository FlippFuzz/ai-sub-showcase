00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:20,345
Yeah! I'd have to go with Pekora-senpai and Gura, but brownie points for Marine.

161
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:24,045
お刺身！お刺身！
Sashimi! Sashimi!

00:13:26,545 --> 00:13:28,045
おらやめろー！
Hey, stop it!

00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:32,045
Okay, next member.

イナ！イナちゃん！
Ina! Ina-chan!

165
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:38,545
Ok, ok. I'll be the judge for this one. Ok.

166
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:43,645
Alright, 3, 2, 1... go!

167
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:48,545
え？ぐら？
Eh? Gura?

Mufunny tentacles! Mufunny tentacles!

172
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:11,245
I'm taking a nap.

00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:13,445

Taking a nap!?

174
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:16,845
昼寝してた！？そうゆう事！？
Taking a nap!? That's it!?

175
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:23,545
Ina, which one is best? I have to go with Gura.

176
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:25,545
Yeah!

177
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:30,045
勝てない、勝てないこれには！
I can't win, I can't win against this!

178
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:33,245
お昼寝か！理解が足りなかった！
A nap! I didn't have enough understanding!

179
00:14:35,045 --> 00:14:37,345
Okay, how about the next one?

180
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:41,545
あめ！ワトソン！アメリアちゃん！
Ame! Watson! Amelia-chan!

181
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:46,545
3, 2, 1... go!

182
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,045
ちょっと手が写ってない...
The hands aren't showing...

183
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:54,445
指が！指が見えてないから！
The fingers! Because you can't see the fingers!

184
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:59,045
これは虫眼鏡をやってるんでしょうが！
I'm doing the magnifying glass though!

185
00:15:00,257 --> 00:15:01,357
見て見て、ぺこら！
Look, Pekora!

186
00:15:01,357 --> 00:15:03,057
見て見て！こうです。
Look! It's like this.

187
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:07,857
あれ、ぐらちゃんとマリン同じなんか？
Wait, are Gura-chan and Marine doing the same one?

188
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:08,557
同じ？
The same?

189
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:10,057
ああ、同じ同じ。
Ah, the same, the same.

190
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:11,857
虫眼鏡！
Magnifying glass!

191
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:14,357
二人わかってない、わかってない。
You two don't get it, don't get it.

192
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:15,057
ぺこらは...
Pekora is...

193
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:17,357
FPSならアメっちゃと言ったでしょ。
I said if it's FPS, it's Ame-chan.

194
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:19,557
ああ、なるほど。うん、アメちゃん大好きだから。
Ah, I see. Yeah, because she loves FPS.

195
00:15:19,557 --> 00:15:23,557
Ame really likes FPS games. Ah, mushimegane.
Ame really likes FPS games. Ah, magnifying glass.

196
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,557
FPS? Hmm. I'll have to go with Pekora-senpai...

197
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:30,557
...'cause Ame doesn't really use this very often.

198
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:33,557
アメちゃんあんまり使ってないんですよね、これ。
Ame-chan doesn't really use this, does she?

199
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,057
あれちょっと。
Wait a minute.

200
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:37,057
ということはFPSかな？
So maybe it's FPS?

201
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:38,557
ああ、あまり使ってなかった。
Ah, she hasn't used it much.

202
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:40,057
お飾り虫眼鏡。
Decorative magnifying glass.

00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:41,557
お飾り虫眼鏡。
Decorative magnifying glass.

204
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:45,057

00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:54,857
Image de, image de. 3, 2, 1, Go!
Imagine it, imagine it. 3, 2, 1, Go!

ぐら？ぐら何それ？
Gura? Gura, what is that?

210
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:05,557
Okay, version...

211
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:07,557

00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,557
Ah, okay. Pekora-senpai and Marine-senpai.

00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:20,057
アイドルさん！アイドルさん！アイドルさん！きゅん！
Idol-san! Idol-san! Idol-san! Kyu~n!

216
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:23,057
Kyu~n pose. I can't choose!

217
00:16:27,557 --> 00:16:28,557
Okay, a draw for this one. A draw.

218
00:16:28,557 --> 00:16:30,057
A draw!

219
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,057
So, what about the next one? Dadun!

220
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:38,557
お、ノエルね！ノエル。
Oh, Noel, right! Noel.

221
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:42,057
That's the part... muzukashii yo.
That's the part... it's hard.

222
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:47,557
Think of the same pose. 3, 2, 1, Go!

223
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:50,057
何だっけ？何とか...メトロノーム！
What was it? Something... Metronome!

00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:54,057
まっするメトロノーム！まっするメトロノーム！
Muscle Metronome! Muscle Metronome!

225
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,057
Muscle Metronome for Pekora-senpai and Marine-senpai.

226
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:02,057
これ？ぐらは...
This? Gura is...

00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:04,557
Kimyou na ugoki. Kimyou move.
Bizarre movement. Bizarre move.

00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,557
ああ、まっする！まっする！
Ah, muscle! Muscle!

229
00:17:14,557 --> 00:17:16,557
Hore mo sa... I can't choose, yeah.
This one too... I can't choose, yeah.

230
00:17:20,557 --> 00:17:23,057
Okay, I'll have to give it to the senpais here. Sorry girl.

231
00:17:23,557 --> 00:17:25,557
さすが！頑張ったのに。
As expected! Even though I tried hard.

232
00:17:25,557 --> 00:17:27,557
You get brownie points for being cute, okay?

233
00:17:28,557 --> 00:17:32,057
Okay, what about... ready for this one? Dadun!

234
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:36,557
ああ！オーケー、オーケー。それしかねえわ。
Ah! Okay, okay. That's the only one.

235
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,557
Let's see. 3, 2, 1, Go!

236
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:43,057
お前ふざけるなよ！お前毎回ケツ出すな！
Don't mess with me! Stop showing your butt every time!

238
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:49,057
またのやるんじゃないだろお前！
You're doing it again, aren't you!?

239
00:17:49,057 --> 00:17:51,057
Ah, Bun Bun Cha, beko.

240
00:17:51,057 --> 00:17:54,057
うさぎぺこでしょ。お前のケツ...ケツ出さねえよ、ぺこちゃんは。
It's Usagi-peko. Your butt... Peko-chan doesn't show her butt.

241
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:57,057
Nani Gura sore? Ah, Bun Bun Cha!
What's that, Gura? Ah, Bun Bun Cha!

242
00:17:57,057 --> 00:17:59,557
ああ、カヨぺと一緒にじゃないか！
Ah, isn't it the same as Kayo-pe!

243
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:02,557
船長も同じじゃないですか。
Isn't Senchou doing the same thing too?

244
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:06,057
え、これ？違うよ、これは...ラビットテイル。
Eh, this? No, this is... Rabbit Tail.

245
00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:10,057
ラビットテイルいってべこやったことねえべこだから！
I've never done Rabbit Tail-peko!

246
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,057
All right. Dore?
All right. Which one?

247
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:17,057
Ya, iru to honnin tte koto wa... honnin iru n desu kedo, chotto are wa chotto...
Well, the actual person is here... though she's here, that's a bit...

248
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:20,057
え、嘘でしょ？そんなことしないよ、ぺこら。
Eh, no way? Pekora doesn't do things like that.

249
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,557
するべこ！するべこ！そんなんしない。
You do-peko! You do-peko! No, she doesn't.

250
00:18:23,557 --> 00:18:26,557
Demo Bun Bun Cha ga motto kakkoii, kakkoii.
But Bun Bun Cha is cooler, cooler.

251
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:30,057
Very cool. Cooler pose. Bun Bun Cha.

252
00:18:30,057 --> 00:18:33,557
Bun Bun Cha. Demo jissai no Bun Bun Cha wa konna n ja nakute, motto konna kanji kara.
Bun Bun Cha. But the real Bun Bun Cha isn't like this, maybe it's more like this.

253
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:36,057
ぐら！同じかない？何でそれよ！
Gura! Isn't it the same? Why that!?

254
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:39,057
こんな感じだわ。確かにそういう感じだわ。
It's like this. Certainly, it's like that.

255
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:45,057
All right, all right. Hai, you ready for the last one? Last one! Dadun!
All right, all right. Okay, you ready for the last one? Last one! Dadun!

ああ！お願いします！わかりました。
Ah! Please! I understand.

257
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:54,557
Okay, okay, everyone got it? I think everyone's got the same one.

258
00:18:55,557 --> 00:18:57,057
All right. 3, 2, 1, Go!

259
00:18:57,557 --> 00:19:00,057
ああ！
Ah!

260
00:19:03,557 --> 00:19:07,557
出航！宝鐘マリンす！宝鐘マリンす！

Yay! Yatta!
Yay! We did it!

263
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:19,057
Yes! Well, that'll be it for all the pose games. Last of the very all. That... yippee!

264
00:19:20,557 --> 00:19:24,057
Mina! Thank you! Yay! Tanoshikatta.
Everyone! Thank you! Yay! That was fun.

265
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:28,057
All right, so you guys ready for the next part of the program?

266
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:31,057
おい！おう！
Oi! Oh!

267
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:35,557
All right, let's go to the next show, which is... I'm gonna get naked.

268
00:19:39,057 --> 00:19:43,057
Employee of the month

269
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:44,057
Ladies and gentlemen, now that we're in the air, I would like to direct your attention...

270
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:48,057
...to the safety instructions in front of you.

271
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:48,057
Safety Instructions / oh nyo

272
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:50,057
Should we find ourselves in a...

273
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:53,057
If the plane's going down, tuck your head between your knees.

274
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:54,557
Whoa!

275
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:58,557
Just don't worry about it. It's just... it's just... oh! It's just turbulence. Don't worry.

276
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,369
think about it.

277
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:10,869
It's like watching Animal Planet.

278
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:20,069
Dirt
by Gawr Gura

279
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:20,169
Look down between your toes.

280
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:23,269
Fellow earthling, what do you see?

281
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:24,769
Is it brown?

282
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:26,269
Is it mushy?

283
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:27,869
Is it dry?

284
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:29,869
This is called dirt.

285
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:33,469
Do you know how many organisms live inside the dirt?

286
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:35,369
Dirt.

287
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,569
As my mom once said, "Dirt Don't Hurt."

288
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:40,469
Dirt.

289
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:44,869
Dang it really tingles.

290
00:20:48,069 --> 00:21:07,069
Showing Off My Room

291
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:59,469
Oh hey, didn't see you there.

292
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:02,369
Want to take a tour inside my bedroom?

293
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:03,969
You do? Cool.

294
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:07,869
Alright, let's go. Follow me this way. Whushaa!

295
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:11,869
Actually, we're gonna check out my gamer PC first.

296
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:14,369
You want to see how cool it is?

297
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:16,669
Check that baby out!

298
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:19,469
That's got eight billion cores.

299
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,569
Did you know that? It's pretty cool, yeah I know.

300
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:25,069
Did I build it myself? Of course I did. Gura PC gamer Gura.

301
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:28,369
Anyway, look at my sofa.

302
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:31,269
I spent ungodly amounts of time on this sofa right here.

303
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:33,269
Could you believe that? I bet you could.

304
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:36,569
Um, if you're asking yourself, "Gura, where is the Ina pillow?"

305
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:42,569
Um, it's currently in the wash.

306
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:47,369
It's gonna... it's coming back, it's in the wash.

307
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:49,069
Don't speculate.

308
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:54,869
Okay, now I want to show you my... ti-ti-ti-ti-ti, hutcha!

309
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:59,069
Fish tank! My Ebi fish tank.

310
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:01,569
Full of scrum-diddly-umptious Ebi.

311
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:05,569
And for those of you that would like to join the fish tank...

312
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:08,069
...after the end of today's program...

313
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:11,269
...there's going to be a form you can fill out and you have to sign.

314
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:14,569
It's like a health waiver but it's permanent for the rest of your lives. Um...

315
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:20,569
Oh, there's my box of stuff too. Well, my multiple boxes of stuff actually.

316
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:23,569
Including... I actually have no idea what's in those, but my trident's there.

317
00:22:24,069 --> 00:22:26,569
It's charging. Neptune said never to touch a charging trident...

318
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:30,369
...because it messes with the power imbalances.

319
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:35,369
I don't know what that means but I didn't ask him to expand on it.

320
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:38,669
Hya!

321
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:41,869
Okay, now, my clothes.

322
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,269
Look at that!

323
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:48,069
They look like they're made of paper. That's because I used an iron for the first time...

324
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:50,069
...and I have no idea how to use an ironing board.

325
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:54,069
But I think they look alright 'cause there's no wrinkles in them.

326
00:22:55,269 --> 00:22:58,569
Okay, now you want to see my table?

327
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:02,569
It's a table full of stuff. There's panties in this drawer.

328
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:06,569
Oh, that's a photo of me. Isn't it great?

329
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:08,069
Uh, let's pretend I didn't say that.

330
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:10,869
Anyway, there's an AC control 'cause I get sweaty at night...

331
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:13,369
...and then there's a fish tank that's also empty...

332
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:16,869
...because I eat everything inside of it at night.

333
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:19,469
It's my midnight snack. You have a mini-fridge, I have a fish tank.

334
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:21,869
So potato-potahto.

335
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,069
My tomato-tomahto.

336
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:27,569
Ah, you want to see this? Check this out!

337
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:32,469
Boom boom boom boom Gura Cam! Pew pew pew pew pew pew pew.

338
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:35,069
Oh my god. Kiara-wa, Auf Wiedersehen.

339
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:38,269
We have Gawr Gura. Domo. We have Calliope Mori. Yoyo.

340
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:40,869
We have Ninomae Ina'nis. Wah.

341
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:46,569
And then we have Amelia Watson. (Gremlin noises) Gawr Gura.

342
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:51,069
Chummy. Yeah.

343
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:54,069
Oh, I see. Something really cool. Look.

344
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:57,669
Ah, hah! Feet.

345
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:04,669
Te-te-te-te. Let's take a closer look at these plushies, shall we?

346
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,569
Hmm, let's start with me.

347
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:12,869
Domo, Chummy desu. It's me, Small Gura. Small and tiny.

348
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:18,569
I can take Gura by the rump.

349
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:22,869
Shake her, shake her, shake all her lunch money out!

350
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:26,569
No, Gura stop! What are you doing to me, Gura?

351
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:31,069
Cute. Don't we look alike?

352
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:33,869
Cheese!

353
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:40,069
Okay, and then we have Auf Wiedersehen!

354
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:43,669
Kiara-wa! I feel like shipping Kiara...

355
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:47,269
...Kiara, Auf Wiedersehen with somebody else who she really likes.

356
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:49,269
Auf Wiedersehen!

357
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:52,569
Kikiriki! Could it be?

358
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:59,069
Yoyo deadbeats, it's me your boy Calliope- Calliope Bomb-son. Ooh.

359
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:00,581
Chu!

360
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:01,381
Chu!

361
00:25:02,131 --> 00:25:02,581
Kyo...
Ki...

362
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:06,581
Wait, I- Calli- Calliope Mori, what are you doing here?

363
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:09,281
Chu!

364
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:10,281
Oh, yabe!
Oh, crap!

365
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:15,081
Chu chu chu chu chu!

366
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,481
You get the idea. You get the idea, don't you?

367
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:23,081
I'll put you back here. I'll put you back here. And then we'll go ahead and we'll take...

368
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:27,281
Amelia Watson and Ninomae Ina'nis-san.

369
00:25:27,381 --> 00:25:30,481
Ina- Ina... What's their ship name called? I'm sure you guys remember. InAme?

370
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:33,281
This is Ame, this is Ina, and then...

371
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:34,581
Chu!

372
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:38,381
Watson, dummy.

373
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:42,581
Chu chu chu chu chu chu chu!

374
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:46,081
Oh, sorry girls. Sorry.

375
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:54,081
Anyway, let's take it back to Goombus. Goombus, Goombus, Goombus, Goombus. Look. Cute now?

376
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:57,681
Oh, do you want to see this?

377
00:25:58,381 --> 00:25:59,881
Ta-da!

378
00:26:00,181 --> 00:26:04,281
Who's gonna go for a fun ride today, Goomba?

379
00:26:13,681 --> 00:26:15,581
Yo! Ousha!

380
00:26:17,081 --> 00:26:19,481
Not bad, Goombus, for someone who can't drive, wouldn't you say?

381
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:21,881
I would say, Gura. Ha!

382
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:22,481
I know.

383
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:25,881
Anyway, is there anything you'd like to say to the people?

384
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:29,881
It's time for you to leave. You've overstayed your welcome.

385
00:26:30,181 --> 00:26:32,681
Gura, you can't say that to the guests. They're here to see you.

386
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:34,881
Oh.

387
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:40,081
Thank you for coming today and checking out my bedroom. I'll see you again real soon.

388
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:43,081
Kiss the shark. Kiss the shark.

389
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:52,081
Okay, it's time for you to go. Goodbye! Goodbye!

390
00:26:52,381 --> 00:26:59,881
Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye!

391
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:08,581
Deep! Boom!

Driving performed by professional(?) on a closed course

393
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:27,581
Yee-haw!

394
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,481
Let's go!

395
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:35,681
Headshot!

396
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:38,281
Ex-shark-inate!

397
00:27:40,181 --> 00:27:41,581
*sorry not a real game lol

398
00:27:42,881 --> 00:27:44,581
Gawr Boost drink. Look at that.

399
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:48,581
You can crack open a nice icy cold Gawr Boost drink.

400
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:53,081
Freshly squeezed shark juice that will refresh you. Yes, it's shark flavored.

401
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:58,281
The Gura flavor specifically. Freshly squeezed, freshly harvested. Yes.

402
00:27:58,881 --> 00:28:03,581
Only for a limited time though, because like I said... I can only...

得意の自己弁護　言い訳でもねえ
Your favorite self-defense, not even an excuse.

406
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:40,081
だって
Because...

407
00:28:40,581 --> 00:28:44,281
ほらほら　また始まった
Look, look, it's started again.

408
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:48,481
ごめんねのキスのパターンって感じ
That "I'm sorry" kiss pattern feeling.

409
00:28:49,281 --> 00:28:51,881
あーに
Oh, please.

410
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:57,281
いつかは私だけ　そうね夢みたこともあったけど
Someday just me, yeah, I once dreamed of that too.

411
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:02,881
淋しいときだけ電話して　もう、うんざりだわ
Calling only when you're lonely, I'm already sick of it.

412
00:29:05,181 --> 00:29:08,581
全然私に興味ないじゃん
You have no interest in me at all.

413
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:11,881
君が好きなのは自分でしょ？
The one you love is yourself, right?

414
00:29:12,581 --> 00:29:16,081
やっぱり私に興味ないじゃん
As I thought, you have no interest in me.

415
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:20,081
その話もう聞き飽きたわ
I'm tired of hearing that story.

416
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:23,481
そもそも大体私に興味ないじゃん
In the first place, you basically have no interest in me.

417
00:29:23,781 --> 00:29:27,481
そうやってまた誤魔化して
Evading like that again.

418
00:29:28,281 --> 00:29:31,581
Be my boy　わがまま過ぎるでしょ
Be my boy, you're way too selfish.

419
00:29:31,781 --> 00:29:34,581
抱きしめてよね
Hold me, okay?

420
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:38,081
本当君はしょうもないな
You really are hopeless.

421
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:41,281
重い私もしようがないわ
My heavy love is also unavoidable.

422
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:44,281
泣いたっていけない、待ったっていけない
Crying won't help, waiting won't help.

423
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:46,881
期待はしないよ
I won't expect anything.

424
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:50,081
もう少しだけなら　踊ってもいいかもな
If it's just a little bit more, maybe it's okay to dance.

425
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:54,281
とろけて　とろけて　生きたいの
I want to live melting away, melting away.

426
00:29:54,681 --> 00:29:58,281
どんなアピールも意味ないし
No matter how I appeal, it's meaningless.

427
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:01,281
気付いてくれないけど
You won't notice, but...

428
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:02,093
ぜんぜん私に興味ないじゃん
You have zero interest in me, right?

429

そもそも大体私に興味ないじゃん
To begin with, you generally have no interest in me.

433

少しぐらい期待させてよ もう
Give me at least a little hope already!

434
00:30:16,593 --> 00:30:20,093
ロンリーガール 独り占めしてよ
Keep this lonely girl all to yourself.

435
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:24,093
Baby 振り回さないで
Baby, don't lead me on.

436
00:30:35,093 --> 00:30:40,093
目、目、耳、目、ワン、トゥ、シャッフルダンス踊りましょう
Eye, eye, ear, eye, one, two, let's dance the shuffle dance.

437
00:30:40,093 --> 00:30:46,593
早く手と手つないで サイコに歌って
Hurry and join hands, and sing like a psycho.

438
00:30:46,593 --> 00:30:50,093
溺れるくらい愛してよ
Love me enough to make me drown.

439
00:30:50,093 --> 00:30:52,593
ぜんぜん私に興味ないじゃん
You have zero interest in me, right?

440
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:55,593
君が好きなのは自分自身でしょ ねえ
The one you love is yourself, isn't it? Hey!

441
00:30:55,593 --> 00:30:58,093
やっぱり私に興味ないじゃん

To begin with, you generally have no interest in me.

444
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:08,093
そうやってまた誤魔化しても
Even if you keep deceiving me like that...

445
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:11,593
ガタガタ言って覚悟はできてるの？
Complaining like that, are you prepared?

A hamburger.

456
00:32:12,593 --> 00:32:17,093
恋とは何かな 考えてみよう
What is love? Let's think about it.

457
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:22,593
ふわふわ熱々 それはまるでバンズ

00:42:23,517 --> 00:42:25,417
Next question!

625
00:42:26,117 --> 00:42:27,617
Question 2: 9x9=?

626
00:42:28,617 --> 00:42:30,917
9 times 9.

627
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:34,117
Wait, there's the finger thing. Do the finger thing, Gura.

628
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:38,617
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

629
00:42:38,617 --> 00:42:40,617
Wait, that doesn't look right.

630
00:42:40,617 --> 00:42:42,617
I'm gonna trust it anyway.

631
00:42:42,617 --> 00:42:43,717
Hai!
Yes!

632
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:47,417
Fifty-one.

633
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:54,517
The finger thing never fails! Ow! Wait, where did that come from?

634
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:59,117
Okay... um... wait, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

635
00:42:59,117 --> 00:43:02,617
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... I have nine- ten fingers.

636
00:43:02,617 --> 00:43:06,117
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...

637
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:08,617
Why did I say fifty-one?!

638
00:43:08,617 --> 00:43:10,117
Hai! Hai! Hai! Hai!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

639
00:43:12,717 --> 00:43:15,617
Eighty-one! Eighty-one!

640
00:43:16,317 --> 00:43:17,417
Answer: 9x9=81

641
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:20,517
Okay, see? I just had a little lapse in brain judgment there.

642
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:25,117
There's nothing wrong with that, right cameraman? There's nothing wrong with that.

643
00:43:25,117 --> 00:43:28,217
Can I have the next question please? I'm ready.

644
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:30,317
Question 3: 54-16=?

645
00:43:32,717 --> 00:43:35,917
Fifty-four minus sixteen.

646
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:39,917
Fifty-four minus ten is forty-four.

647
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:43,117
Forty-four minus six...

648
00:43:43,117 --> 00:43:48,617
...three, two, one, thirty... twenty-nine, twenty-eight...

649
00:43:48,617 --> 00:43:50,117
Hai!
Yes!

650
00:43:52,117 --> 00:43:54,117
Twenty-eight.

651
00:43:58,317 --> 00:44:00,717
Actually thought I had that one there, wait let me try again.

652
00:44:00,717 --> 00:44:03,617
Fifty-four minus ten... fifty-four minus ten... fifty-four minus ten...

653
00:44:03,617 --> 00:44:06,617
...is forty-four.

654
00:44:06,617 --> 00:44:13,317
Minus six... forty-four, forty-three, forty-two, forty-one, forty, thirty-nine, thir-

655
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,417
Hai!
Yes!

656
00:44:16,217 --> 00:44:18,117
Thirty-eight.

657
00:44:19,217 --> 00:44:20,417
Answer: 54-16=38

658
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:24,217
So... that ain't so bad, is it, huh?

659
00:44:24,217 --> 00:44:27,617
No, this all-ebi piling up next to me is not so bad, is it?
No, this all-shrimp piling up next to me is not so bad, is it?

660
00:44:27,617 --> 00:44:32,517
Keep 'em coming, keep 'em coming.

661
00:44:32,517 --> 00:44:35,617
Can I have the next question? I'm on a roll.

662
00:44:35,617 --> 00:44:37,417
Question 4: 17x2+3=?

663
00:44:38,317 --> 00:44:41,617
Um... can I use PEMDAS?

664
00:44:41,617 --> 00:44:46,617
PEMDAS is parentheses...

665
00:44:48,517 --> 00:44:54,617
PEMDAS... three plus five is... three plus two... oh, three plus two is five...

666
00:44:54,617 --> 00:44:59,117
...times seventeen is...

667
00:44:59,117 --> 00:45:00,117
...is...

668
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:04,829
Um... wait, 17 times 5?

669
00:45:05,529 --> 00:45:07,629
5 times... 5 times 7 is...

670
00:45:09,729 --> 00:45:12,729
5 times 7 is 40.

671
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,629
5 times... 7 is 4... 17 times...

672
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:21,129
I don't remember how to do shorthand multiplication.

673
00:45:21,229 --> 00:45:23,129
This is actually terrible. Um...

674
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,529
They said I wasn't gonna get these questions right,

675
00:45:25,629 --> 00:45:27,529
and I told them that I was gonna get it right,

676
00:45:27,629 --> 00:45:29,429
but it looks like I'm not gonna be able to get it right,

677
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:33,629
and now there's shrimp flying everywhere. 5 times 17 is...

678
00:45:38,929 --> 00:45:40,129
31?

679
00:45:40,629 --> 00:45:41,629
5?

680
00:45:47,529 --> 00:45:50,129
105!

681
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:54,129
Gah! I...

682
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:58,329
Uh... okay, looks like we're back to the drawing board.

683
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:01,129
17 times 5... 17...

684
00:46:02,129 --> 00:46:04,629
I'm going to write it out. 17 times 5.

685
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,629
5 times 7, I believe is...

686
00:46:09,729 --> 00:46:11,829
I'll say it's 35. Carry the 1.

687
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:15,129
5 times 1 is 5, 6, 7, 8.

688
00:46:16,929 --> 00:46:17,929
Hah!

689
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:21,129
85!

690
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:30,129
Okay, back to the drawing board.

691
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,129
I could have sworn I did that right.

692
00:46:32,529 --> 00:46:34,529
Am I forgetting how to do longhand multiplication?

693
00:46:34,629 --> 00:46:36,129
Or is this shorthand multiplication? I don't know.

694
00:46:36,229 --> 00:46:38,629
5 times 5 is 5... 6, 7, 8.

695
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,829
How is this wrong? How did I get...?

696
00:46:40,929 --> 00:46:43,629
I can't see with all these shrimp everywhere.

697
00:46:43,729 --> 00:46:47,129
How did I get this wrong? How did I get this wrong?

698
00:46:48,129 --> 00:46:49,329
87!

699
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:55,329
Can I get a hint?

700
00:46:55,429 --> 00:46:57,329
Can I get a hint, please?!

701
00:46:58,629 --> 00:47:00,129
No hints? Okay.

702
00:47:00,229 --> 00:47:03,129
Be that way then. Fine.

703
00:47:03,629 --> 00:47:06,529
5 times 7 is 30. We'll say it's 30 now.

704
00:47:06,629 --> 00:47:09,129
Now it's 30... Carry the 5? 6, 7, 8.

705
00:47:10,629 --> 00:47:11,929
Hah!

706
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:14,129
80!

707
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,129
わかりません。
I don't understand.

708
00:47:22,229 --> 00:47:25,629
I don't understand, and this is really terrible.

709
00:47:25,729 --> 00:47:27,529
Am I getting this math wrong?

710
00:47:27,629 --> 00:47:29,929
5... please end this torture. Can I have the next question?

711
00:47:32,629 --> 00:47:34,129
Hint, please!

712
00:47:35,429 --> 00:47:38,329
Go from left to right, in order.

713
00:47:39,129 --> 00:47:42,629
17 times 2. Am I just doing my math wrong?

714
00:47:43,129 --> 00:47:46,629
17 times 2. 7 times 2 is 14.

715
00:47:46,729 --> 00:47:51,629
Carry the 1. 2, 3... plus 3 equals...

716
00:47:56,329 --> 00:47:57,629
Hah!

717
00:48:00,429 --> 00:48:02,129
37!

718
00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:08,629
Yeah-da! Hah! Hoi!

719
00:48:09,629 --> 00:48:11,629
Next question.

720
00:48:15,629 --> 00:48:17,529
Ugh... okay.

721
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:22,429
Um, 6... uh... 6 times 20 is...

722
00:48:22,529 --> 00:48:26,529
6 times 2 is 12, so 6 times 20 is...

723
00:48:26,629 --> 00:48:30,429
...is a hundred... oh god... is 120.

724
00:48:30,529 --> 00:48:32,229
Times... minus 9... wait, okay.

725
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:34,129
Wait, do I start from the beginning?

726
00:48:34,229 --> 00:48:36,529
For the last one I'm supposed to start for this one.

727
00:48:36,629 --> 00:48:39,829
6 times 20 is... 6 times 20... 6 times 20.

728
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:42,629
6 times 2 is 12, so 6 times 20 is 120.

729
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:50,129
Right? Minus 9 is... minus 9...

730
00:48:50,229 --> 00:48:54,529
120 minus 9 is 119... is 109.

731
00:48:54,629 --> 00:48:59,129
109 times 13 is... 1 times... gah!

732
00:49:00,529 --> 00:49:01,429
Hah!

733
00:49:03,929 --> 00:49:10,629
100... 1000... 1000... 1130?

734
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:15,929
Okay... okay... um, 9... 120 minus 9 is 119...

735
00:49:18,929 --> 00:49:22,529
...times 13 is... 109 minus 13?

736
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:24,529
109 minus 13 is... oh.

737
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:30,629
Wait, why are the shrimp getting bigger and then taller and higher?

738
00:49:31,129 --> 00:49:36,629
T-t-t-t... the constant ticking is not helping.

739
00:49:36,929 --> 00:49:42,629
120 minus 9. 20... 120. 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11.

740
00:49:43,129 --> 00:49:45,029
Oh, okay. It's 111.

741
00:49:45,129 --> 00:49:48,129
111 times 13 is... Hah!

742
00:49:48,929 --> 00:49:51,629
1113!

743
00:49:54,129 --> 00:49:58,329
Was that what I answered last time? Ah! Okay. Okay.

744
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:01,241
Wait! Okay, okay, okay.

745
00:50:01,241 --> 00:50:02,441
Okay, okay.

746
00:50:02,441 --> 00:50:06,641
Okay... Uh... Well, that's 100 and... 111.

747
00:50:07,641 --> 00:50:10,641
111 minus... times 13 is...

748
00:50:11,941 --> 00:50:14,341
Ah! What is that? 111 times 13 is...

749
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:16,941
Hi!

750
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:20,141
1,213.

751
00:50:26,641 --> 00:50:27,641
1,000...

752
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:28,641
Hi!

753
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:31,941
1,412.

754
00:50:33,341 --> 00:50:37,641
You guys! It's not even waiting for me
to get the answer wrong. I mean, right.

755
00:50:38,141 --> 00:50:39,141
Hi!

756
00:50:40,141 --> 00:50:41,641
1,604.

757
00:50:45,141 --> 00:50:47,141
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

758
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:55,141
Hi!

759
00:50:55,141 --> 00:50:58,641
Multiplication first. / 掛け算を先にしよう

760
00:50:59,141 --> 00:51:02,641
20 minus 9 is 11, 11 times 6 is 66 times 13.

761
00:51:02,641 --> 00:51:04,641
See, that's an entirely different math equation now.

762
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:12,141
Thanks, math god.
Could have used that about three minutes ago.

763
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:14,641
Now I've made a fool of myself
in front of everybody.

764
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:19,641
Wait, what did I say before? 20 minus...

765
00:51:22,141 --> 00:51:25,641
Now they've just changed the answer,
they said multiplication first.

766
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:28,641
Well, the guy in my ear doesn't seem
to be getting his information right.

767
00:51:29,341 --> 00:51:31,641
6 times 2... 20... No, we already... Okay, wait.

768
00:51:32,341 --> 00:51:33,641
Oh, wait! I got it! I got it!

769
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:36,641
6 times 20 is a hundred... Wait, no,
6 times 20 is...

770
00:51:36,641 --> 00:51:38,641
Uh, this is really embarrassing.

771
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:42,641
120 minus 9 times 13 is...

772
00:51:44,341 --> 00:51:46,641
9 times 13...

773
00:51:46,941 --> 00:51:49,141
9 times 3 is 27... 21? Did I do that right?

774
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:58,141
9... 10... 11... 111 times 120...
I hope I'll get this right!

775
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:05,641
Hi!

776
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:09,641
10,020.

777
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:20,641
I think I'm gonna...
I think I'm gonna get another hint. Please!

778
00:52:21,641 --> 00:52:22,941
Please!

779
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:26,641
Multiplication first, then subtraction. / それぞれの掛け算をしてから引き算をしよう

780
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:29,641
Please! This isn't a hint! This isn't a hint! Please!

781
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:37,141
10... 120 minus...
120 minus...

782
00:52:42,641 --> 00:52:45,141
Hi! Hi! Hi!

783
00:52:47,641 --> 00:52:49,641
104!

784
00:53:01,941 --> 00:53:03,641
Aah! Boy!

785
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:09,641
だめですよ！
No way!

786
00:53:10,141 --> 00:53:11,641
Dah!

787
00:53:16,641 --> 00:53:17,641
Hello?

788
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:20,941
Like, seriously.

789
00:53:21,341 --> 00:53:23,941
Um, okay. It's like, 'Hooked on UwU'.

790
00:53:24,641 --> 00:53:29,641
Reading can weally weally help you like, UwU.
Have like a way better vocabulary.

791
00:53:37,641 --> 00:53:38,641
Like, totally.

792
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:43,941
Are you looking for a delightful getaway
in the deep forest of the unknown souls?

793
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:47,941
Well, do I have the perfect vacation home for you.

794
00:53:48,641 --> 00:53:52,641
Locked away 3,000 miles in the deep woods
where no one will hear you scream,

795
00:53:52,641 --> 00:53:56,641
the Mushroom Kings await for your great return.

796
00:53:57,341 --> 00:54:01,641
They've prepared a feast for you,
or maybe you're the feast.

797
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:07,641
All right, so that wraps up all the
games and quizzes for today.

798
00:54:07,641 --> 00:54:10,141
What'd you guys think? どうでしたか？

00:55:05,253 --> 00:55:05,753

817
00:55:05,853 --> 00:55:06,253
Yes?

818
00:55:06,353 --> 00:55:08,253

Can I take it? Can I take it?

820
00:55:13,153 --> 00:55:14,653
え、何！？何！？
Eh, what!? What!?

821
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,753
やばい！やばい！
This is bad! This is bad!

822
00:55:17,153 --> 00:55:18,653
お前、お前、誰！？
You, who are you!?

823
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:20,253
何だこれ！
What the heck is this!

824
00:55:20,453 --> 00:55:21,653
痛い、痛い！
It hurts, it hurts!

825
00:55:21,753 --> 00:55:23,153

826
00:55:24,853 --> 00:55:26,253

830
00:55:46,953 --> 00:55:49,153
Hi everyone! It's the Gura Shoulder Bag!

831
00:55:49,253 --> 00:55:50,653
Oh my god!

832
00:55:51,253 --> 00:55:53,953
With very sharky embroideries...

833
00:55:54,053 --> 00:55:56,153
...matching none other than me, Gawr Gura!

834
00:55:56,253 --> 00:55:58,653
A jacquard-weave shoulder strap...

835
00:55:58,753 --> 00:56:00,953
...which is very trendy and very cool!

836
00:56:01,053 --> 00:56:03,153
Which we've even included.

837
00:56:03,253 --> 00:56:05,653
The inside fabric actually matches that...

838
00:56:05,753 --> 00:56:08,653
...of my very first casual outfit...

839
00:56:08,753 --> 00:56:10,653
...the very cool pattern, yeah!

840
00:56:10,753 --> 00:56:12,153
Gawr Gura! Mmm-hmm.

841
00:56:12,253 --> 00:56:15,153
This bag is perfectly sized for your books...

842
00:56:15,253 --> 00:56:17,153
...or other small belongings...

843
00:56:17,253 --> 00:56:19,653
...as well as perhaps your very own Guar Boost drink!

844
00:56:20,153 --> 00:56:22,153
Alright, that's all from me folks!

845
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,653
Bye-bye!
