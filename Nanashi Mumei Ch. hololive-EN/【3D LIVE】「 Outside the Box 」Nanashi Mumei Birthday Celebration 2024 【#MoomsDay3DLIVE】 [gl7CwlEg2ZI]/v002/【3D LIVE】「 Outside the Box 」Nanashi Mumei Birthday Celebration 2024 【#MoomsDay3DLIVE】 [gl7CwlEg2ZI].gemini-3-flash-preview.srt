3
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,400
焚き火 掲げて
Holding up a bonfire,

4
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,500
立ち止まっているの
are you standing still?

5
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,500
...いるの
...still?

6
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,400
数え出して
Start counting,

7
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,500
痛みの数なんだっつー
it's the number of pains.

8
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,000
眠るまで ずっと
Until I fall asleep, forever.

9
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,500
黒い 鳥が飛んで見えた
I saw a black bird fly by.

10
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,500
小さな猫をさらって消えてった
It snatched a small cat and disappeared.

11
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,500
心が千切れるまま 叫ぶ
Screaming as my heart is torn apart,

12
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,000
その 報いを
for that retribution.

13
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,800
いつか 曖昧なままで隠した
Someday, hidden away in vagueness,

14
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,000
虹の中へ
into the rainbow.

15
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,800
抱いた 日がまた 私を焦がすなら
If the day I held it burns me again,

16
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,500
愛を 探して 巡る星
searching for love, the wandering stars,

17
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,800
希望を待って
waiting for hope.

18
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,800
泣いた 日々がまた 崩れ落ちたとしても
Even if the crying days crumble away again.

19
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,400
焚き火 壊して
Destroy the bonfire,

20
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,000
誰か つながっているの
is someone connected?

21
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,400
...いるの
...connected?

22
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
数え出して
Start counting,

23
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,200
失敗 ばかり 語る
talking only about failures.

24
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,300
偽物の宇宙壊せ
Destroy the fake universe.

25
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,200
黒い 渦が巻いて見えた
I saw a black vortex swirling.

26
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
小さな 苦しみだけ 消えてった
Only small sufferings disappeared.

27
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,000
言葉にできなかったから
Because I couldn't put it into words.

28
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,508
…真っ向喰うを
…devouring it head-on

29
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:07,808
いつか愛を連れ出して　不甲斐ないから及びを捨てて
Someday I'll lead love away,
since I'm pathetic, I'll cast away my reach

30
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,808
大体　痛み回って　私は解くから
Pain mostly circulates,
since I will solve it

31
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:17,808
愛を探して　巡る本気　星を追って
Searching for love,
chasing the serious stars as they turn

32
00:05:18,808 --> 00:05:22,808
泣いた日々がまた　重んで消えようとしても
Even if the days I cried pile up
and try to disappear again

33
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:27,808
まだ終われないから
Because it's not over yet

34
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:36,508
また焔が立ち昇り出す
The flames begin to rise again

35
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:21,008
いつか曖昧なままで　なくしたイメージの中へ
Someday, remaining ambiguous,
into the lost image

36
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:25,808
だいたい光待って　私は焦がすから
Mostly waiting for the light,
since I will scorch it

37
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:30,808
愛を探して　巡る本気　星を追って
Searching for love,
chasing the serious stars as they turn

38
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,808
繋いだ手はまた　ずっと放さないまま
The hands we joined,
I won't let go of them for a long time

39
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:40,508
愛を連れ出して　不甲斐ないから及びを捨てて
Taking love away,
since I'm pathetic, I'll cast away my reach

40
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:45,508
大体　痛み回って　私は解くから
Pain mostly circulates,
since I will solve it

41
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:50,508
愛を探して　巡る本気　星を追って
Searching for love,
chasing the serious stars as they turn

42
00:06:51,508 --> 00:06:55,508
泣いた日々がまた　重んで消えようとしても
Even if the days I cried pile up
and try to disappear again

43
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,208
消えようとしても
Even if it tries to disappear

44
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,208
離さないから
Because I won't let go

45
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,208
消えようとしても
Even if it tries to disappear

46
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,708
離さないから
Because I won't let go

48
00:07:51,708 --> 00:08:02,508
君を繋ぐ空の星が一つ　音を立てても
Even if one star in the sky
that connects you makes a sound

49
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:14,308
どれも同じ雨に濡れた夢ばかり　乾くだけの鼓動
Every single one is a dream drenched in the same rain,
a heartbeat that only withers

50
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:24,808
相手をなぞる答えに疲れた
I'm tired of the answers
that trace my partner

51
00:08:25,808 --> 00:08:35,308
繰り返す言い訳に崩れた朝
A morning that crumbled
into repeating excuses

52
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:41,308
掴めないデイドリーム　手をくれたストーリーと
An unreachable daydream,
with the story that lent a hand

53
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:47,808
栄光が何処へ　叫び唱えても
No matter how much I shout and chant
where the glory went

54
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:52,808
荒れたZoneは前も潜れない
I can't even dive into the rough Zone anymore

55
00:08:53,308 --> 00:09:00,008
だからSilence　灯すThe melody
So, Silence, the melody that lights up

56
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:34,808
そっと歯車のように嵌まるピースが　疼こうとしても
Even if the pieces that fit like gears
quietly try to ache

57
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:46,308
絵もない偽りと同じ　黄昏に並ぶだけの証
The same as a pictureless lie,
evidence that only lines up in the twilight

58
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:57,308
箱の中に揃えた苛立ち
Irritation gathered inside a box

59
00:09:57,808 --> 00:10:05,508
順番待ちさらし　誤魔化しの鼓動
Exposed while waiting in line,
a heartbeat of deception

60
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:08,496
Don't be afraid, daybreak has come.

61
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:12,296
Daydream, 遠く去った あの日のヴィジョン
Daydream, the vision of that day gone far away

62
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:19,396
君の夢が 横で外れても
Even if your dream goes astray beside me

63
00:10:19,696 --> 00:10:24,396
僕は歌い 橋を架けよう
I will sing and build a bridge

64
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:31,496
だからSilence 鳴らすな 鼓動
So Silence, don't let the heartbeat sound

65
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:38,796
どこまでも 高架線沿ったリズム
A rhythm along the elevated tracks forever

66
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:44,696
過ぎた街並みは 終わりの合図と溶け
The passing townscape melts with the signal of the end

67
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:49,896
伝えない ディザミかけのイメージに
Into an inexpressible, half-disassembled image

68
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:55,696
目が覚めてゆく 孤独のショート
Waking up from a short moment of solitude

69
00:10:58,096 --> 00:11:04,496
砕けた Crying dream 飛び立った 逆相の間違い
A broken Crying dream, a mistake of running in the opposite direction taking flight

70
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:09,296
誘い 溺れ はしゃいでても
Even if I'm lured, drowning, and frolicking

71
00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:14,296
僕は歌い 舵を捨てよう
I will sing and throw away the helm

72
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:21,496
だからSilence 響くな 鼓動
So Silence, don't let the heartbeat echo

73
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:26,996
Don't be afraid, daybreak has come.

74
00:11:29,996 --> 00:11:32,496
Don't be afraid, daybreak has come.

75
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:37,896
Don't be afraid, daybreak has come.

76
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:43,296
Don't be afraid, daybreak has come.

Let it all out, Let it all out.

79
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:17,796
強がらなくていいんだね
You don't have to pretend to be strong

80
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:23,996
誰かが描いてた 壁の落書きの花が揺れる
Flowers in graffiti on a wall someone drew are swaying

81
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:35,496
自分らしさなんて 誰もわからないよ
No one knows what it means to be "yourself"

82
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:41,296
長い長い道の途中で 無くしたり 拾ったり
Losing things, picking things up on a long, long road

83
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:46,496
急に寂しくなって 泣いちゃう日もあるけど
There are days when I suddenly feel lonely and cry, but...

84
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:57,296
涙も痛みも 星に替えよう
Let's turn tears and pain into stars

85
00:12:57,596 --> 00:13:02,796
明日を照らす 灯をともそう
Let's light a flame that illuminates tomorrow

86
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:08,396
小さな迷いも 二人で創ろう
Let's create even small hesitations together

87
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:14,196
星屑を 強く光る 永久（とわ）を咲かそう
Let's make the stardust shine brightly and let eternity bloom

88
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:29,496
Let it all out, Let it all out.

89
00:13:30,196 --> 00:13:34,596
足りないことだらけよね
It's full of things that are lacking, isn't it?

90
00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:39,396
足りなくていいんだね
It's okay to be lacking

91
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:45,996
だから君と出会えたんだ
That's why I was able to meet you

92
00:13:46,996 --> 00:13:52,396
「確か」が何なのか それが知りたくて
I wanted to know what "certainty" was

93
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:58,296
小さなナイフを 靴の下に隠してた
I hid a small knife under my shoe

94
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:03,996
強がってついた 嘘のほうがずっと痛かった
The lies I told while acting strong hurt much more

95
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:13,396
本当は怖いよ だけど生きてゆく
I'm actually scared, but I'll keep living

96
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:19,196
笑顔の君を 風が撫でてゆく
The wind strokes you as you smile

97
00:14:19,496 --> 00:14:24,396
小さな手かざして 二人で創ろう
Holding up our small hands, let's create together

98
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:30,396
星屑を 強く光る 永久（とわ）を咲かそう
Let's make the stardust shine brightly and let eternity bloom

99
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:35,396
正しいことが間違ってたらどうすればいい？
What should I do if the right thing is wrong?

100
00:14:35,696 --> 00:14:40,796
悲しいことが正しかったら受け入れるだけ？
If sad things are right, do I just accept them?

101
00:14:41,396 --> 00:14:45,996
失くしたと思ってた でも君が知ってた
I thought I lost it, but you knew

102
00:14:46,496 --> 00:14:51,996
君がいて本当に良かった
I'm really glad you were here

103
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:13,512
Ah...

104
00:15:13,832 --> 00:15:18,362
意地も痛みも 星に変えよう
Let's turn our stubbornness and pain into stars.

105
00:15:18,362 --> 00:15:24,852
明日を照らす明かりを灯そう
Let's light the lamp that illuminates tomorrow.

106
00:15:25,462 --> 00:15:29,832
小さな手かざして 二人で創ろう
With our small hands held up, let's create together.

107
00:15:30,032 --> 00:15:35,862
星屑を 強く光る永遠を
Stardust, an eternity that shines brightly.

108
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:40,862
さよなら いつかは 来るかもしれない
A farewell might come one day.

109
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:46,862
季節は それでも 巡り巡ってゆく
Even so, the seasons will keep on turning.

110
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:51,762
小さく迷っても 歩いてく君と
Even with small hesitations, I'll walk with you.

111
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:58,012
歩いてく 空だけは変わらないでいてね
I'll keep walking, just please let the sky stay the same.

目を閉じては夕暮れ
Closing your eyes, it's twilight.

115
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:42,562
何を思っているのだろうか
I wonder what you're thinking about.

116
00:16:47,862 --> 00:16:51,262
瞼を開いていた
Your eyelids were open.

117
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:55,262
あなたの目に色付いた
Colors appeared in your eyes.

118
00:16:55,462 --> 00:17:00,012
少しだけ春の匂いがした
There was a faint scent of spring.

119

Shine and shine, flowers bloom.

120
00:17:13,562 --> 00:17:18,262
咲いて晴れのせ
Blooming, all because of the sun.

Even the rain, once it stops...

122
00:17:23,062 --> 00:17:28,062
あなたを飾る晴る

僕ら晴れ風
We are the sunny breeze.

00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:41,462
あの雲も払ってゆけ
Go and brush away those clouds.

126
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:47,262
遠くまで、遠くまで
To the far distance, far away.

127
00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:57,462
あなたは晴れ模様に
You, in a sunny mood.

128
00:17:57,662 --> 00:18:01,862
目を閉じては青色
Closing your eyes, it's blue.

129
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:07,462
何か悲しいのだろうか
I wonder if something is sad.

130
00:18:12,862 --> 00:18:16,262
瞼を開いている
Your eyelids are open.

131
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:20,262

Colors appeared in your eyes.

132

今少し、雨の匂いがした
Just now, there was a faint scent of rain.

133
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:38,462
泣きに泣け、空よ泣け
Cry and cry, sky cry out.

134
00:18:38,662 --> 00:18:42,862
泣いて雨のせ
Crying, all because of the rain.

135
00:18:43,062 --> 00:18:47,862

Even the pouring rain...

136

00:19:02,062 --> 00:19:06,262
あの海も払ってゆけ
Go and brush away that sea.

140
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:12,062
遠くまで、遠くまで
To the far distance, far away.

141
00:19:28,462 --> 00:19:32,562
通り雨、草を靡かせ
A passing shower, making the grass sway.

142
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:37,462
土、雲、あれも晴るのせい
The earth, the clouds, those too are because of the sun.

143
00:19:37,662 --> 00:19:42,462
風のよう、胸に晴るのせい
Like the wind, the sun in my heart is the cause.

144
00:19:42,662 --> 00:19:48,562
晴るを待つ
Waiting for the sun.

145
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:56,462
晴れに晴れ、空よ咲け
Shine and shine, sky bloom.

146
00:19:56,662 --> 00:20:00,862
咲いて晴れのせ
Blooming, all because of the sun.

147
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:05,262
降り止めば雨でさえ
Even the rain, once it stops...

148
00:20:05,462 --> 00:20:06,012
あなたを
...you.

149
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:08,028
僕らはずっと 晴るを待つ
We've been waiting for clear skies all along

150
00:20:09,828 --> 00:20:12,828
胸を打つ音奏でて
Playing the beats that strike our hearts

151
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:17,528
僕ら晴る風
We are the breeze of clear skies

152
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:22,828
音に聞く晴るの風
The breeze of clear skies we hear in the sound

153
00:20:24,028 --> 00:20:27,028
さあこの歌よ凪げ
Now, may this song bring a calm

154
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,528
晴れに晴れ 花よ咲け
Clearing and clearing, let the flowers bloom

155
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:36,528
咲いて晴るのせい
Bloom, because of the clear skies

156
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:42,028
あの雲も越えてゆけ
Go even beyond those clouds

157
00:20:43,028 --> 00:20:47,028
遠くまで 遠くまで
To somewhere far away, far away

memories
Lyrics: Maki Otsuki Music: Junta Mori

159
00:21:31,428 --> 00:21:34,828
小さな頃には 宝の地図が
When I was little, a treasure map

160
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:39,028
頭の中に 浮かんでいて
Would float around in my head

161
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:48,828
いつでも探した 奇跡の場所を
I was always searching for that place of miracles

162
00:21:49,728 --> 00:21:53,328
知らない誰かに 負けないように
So I wouldn't lose to anyone I didn't know

163
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,428
La la la...

164
00:22:02,428 --> 00:22:04,228
今では
But now

165
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:10,628
埃だらけの毎日
Every day is covered in dust

166
00:22:13,828 --> 00:22:17,828
いつの日か 全ての
One day, I'll just surrender

167
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:22,228
時に身をまかせるだけ
Myself to the flow of time

168
00:22:28,428 --> 00:22:32,328
もしも世界が変わるのなら
If the world were to change

169
00:22:35,828 --> 00:22:40,028
何も知らない頃の私に
Take me back to the time when I didn't know anything

170
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,828
連れていって 思い出が
Take me back so that my memories

171
00:22:46,828 --> 00:22:50,828
色あせないように
Never fade away

172
00:23:01,028 --> 00:23:05,028
小さな頃から 歌を歌って
I've been singing songs since I was little

173
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:09,528
夢見る心 温めてた
Warming my dreaming heart

174
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:19,028
みんなで真似した 秘密のメロディ
The secret melody we all used to imitate

175
00:23:20,228 --> 00:23:24,028
今度は上手に 聞こえるように
Hoping it'll sound better this time

176
00:23:30,028 --> 00:23:32,628
La la la...

177
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:34,828
今では
But now

178
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:40,428
ため息ついてばかりで
I'm doing nothing but sighing

179
00:23:44,028 --> 00:23:47,828
誰もまだ 本当の
And still no one is able

180
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:52,028
夢さえつかめないまま
To grasp their true dreams

181
00:23:58,028 --> 00:24:02,028
もしも時代が戻るのなら
If time were to turn back

182
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:10,028
涙を知った頃の私に
Take me back to the time when I first learned of tears

183
00:24:12,528 --> 00:24:15,528
連れていって せつなさが
Take me back so that this sadness

184
00:24:16,528 --> 00:24:20,828
追いつかないように
Can't catch up to me

185
00:24:23,828 --> 00:24:27,028
もしも世界が変わるのなら
If the world were to change

186
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:35,028
何も知らない頃の私に
Take me back to the time when I didn't know anything

187
00:24:37,828 --> 00:24:40,828
連れていって 思い出が
Take me back so that my memories

188
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:45,528
色あせないように
Never fade away

189
00:24:51,828 --> 00:24:54,828
連れていって せつなさが
Take me back so that this sadness

190
00:24:55,828 --> 00:25:00,028
追いつかないように
Can't catch up to me

191
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:22,585
ぼくらのレットイットビー

193
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:30,165
生まれ変われるのなら
If I could be reborn

194
00:27:31,515 --> 00:27:35,435
目印になるから待っていてよ
I'll become a signpost, so please wait for me

195
00:27:36,485 --> 00:27:41,385
小指と小指の長い糸
The long thread between our pinkies

196
00:27:42,585 --> 00:27:46,985
解けないように結んでおこう
Let's tie it so it won't come undone

197
00:27:48,385 --> 00:27:50,285
夏祭り
Summer festival

198
00:27:51,385 --> 00:27:53,385
天気雨降り
A sunshower falls

199
00:27:54,185 --> 00:27:56,085
空に
In the sky...

200
00:27:56,485 --> 00:28:00,185
地図がかかるころなの
...it's around the time a map hangs

201
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:07,385
凍った感情が
Frozen emotions

202
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:10,985
いつか君を消していく
Will one day erase you

203
00:28:11,185 --> 00:28:12,885
言えなくなると
When words go unsaid

204
00:28:13,185 --> 00:28:15,685
灯し守れる魂火
A soul fire we can keep lit and protect

205
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,485
でも独りじゃないと
But because you're not alone

206
00:28:19,385 --> 00:28:21,885
解け落ちていないから
Because it hasn't unraveled and fallen

207
00:28:23,385 --> 00:28:26,685
また僕たちは出会う時が来る
The time for us to meet again will come

208
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:30,085
きっと
Surely

209
00:28:37,335 --> 00:28:40,385
僕ら大人になったら
When we grow up

210
00:28:41,385 --> 00:28:44,585
正義のヒーローになるんだ
We'll become heroes of justice

211
00:28:48,235 --> 00:28:51,585
地球の平和を守るのさ
We'll protect the peace of the world

212
00:28:53,185 --> 00:28:55,885
探険しようぜ
Let's go on an adventure

213
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,985
お化け屋敷
In the haunted house

214
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:01,785
でも本当は
But in truth...

215
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:05,885
怖くて泣き虫
...I'm a scaredy-cat crybaby

216
00:29:06,985 --> 00:29:10,785
一緒にいたいだけ
I just want to be with you

217
00:29:15,835 --> 00:29:18,385
明日も晴れて
If tomorrow is clear too

218
00:29:18,985 --> 00:29:21,585
空を青く照らせば
And the sky is lit up blue

219
00:29:22,485 --> 00:29:24,485
僕らはここに
Let's build a...

220
00:29:24,885 --> 00:29:27,085
秘密基地を作ろう
...secret base here

221
00:29:27,885 --> 00:29:30,385
そして探険しよう
And then, let's explore

222
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:33,485
雨ならゲームをしよう
If it rains, let's play games

223
00:29:33,985 --> 00:29:36,085
そんな時間が
That kind of time...

224
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:40,085
ずっと続くはずだったんだ
...was supposed to last forever

225
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:42,585
そう
That's right

226
00:29:59,685 --> 00:30:03,185
悪者は僕だった
I was the bad guy

227
00:30:03,728 --> 00:30:07,228
行けたならば僕は
If I could have gone, I...

228
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:14,228
嘘じゃない 本当の嘘つきだった
...wouldn't have lied, but I was a real liar.

229
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:23,128
花束に包まれて 目を瞑る君は
Wrapped in a bouquet, as you close your eyes,

230
00:30:24,028 --> 00:30:32,228
安らかに 清らかに 眠っていたんだ
You were sleeping peacefully and purely.

231
00:30:54,928 --> 00:30:59,028
変わらぬ感情が いつか君を消していく
Unchanging feelings will one day erase you.

232
00:31:00,228 --> 00:31:05,028
失う前に 冷えてしまう前に
Before I lose you, before it gets cold.

233
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:10,328
何度願ったって 仏は来ていなかった
No matter how many times I prayed, Buddha never came.

234
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:19,228
きっと僕たちは 出会う時が来る きっと
Surely the time will come for us to meet. Surely.

235
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:37,228
Yippee!

236
00:32:39,528 --> 00:32:41,528
Hello! You want some marshmallows?

237
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,728
I heard marshmallows!

238
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:46,828
Marshmallows!

239
00:32:47,028 --> 00:32:48,028
マシュマロだって！
She said marshmallows!

マシュマロだって！
She said marshmallows!

244
00:32:52,028 --> 00:32:53,028
マシュマロ！
Marshmallow!

245
00:32:53,028 --> 00:32:55,028
マシュマロ！
Marshmallow!

246
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:02,428
食べていいの？
Can we eat them?

247
00:33:02,428 --> 00:33:03,428
Can we eat?

248
00:33:03,728 --> 00:33:04,728
Really?!

249
00:33:04,728 --> 00:33:05,728
やっほー！
Yay!

250
00:33:05,728 --> 00:33:07,228
My marshmallow!

251
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,428
Marshmallow party!

252
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:17,228
じゃあ一緒に、乾杯！
Then, together... Cheers!

253
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:24,728
乾杯！
Cheers!

254
00:33:26,328 --> 00:33:27,528
Marshmallow-chan!

255
00:33:27,528 --> 00:33:28,528
Let's go!

256
00:33:28,728 --> 00:33:30,028
キャンプファイヤー！
Campfire!

257
00:33:30,028 --> 00:33:31,228
Fire!

258
00:33:31,228 --> 00:33:32,728
Fire! Fire marshmallow!

259
00:33:31,728 --> 00:33:33,228
Are you gonna roast marshmallows?

260
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:34,728
I'm amazing at it.

261
00:33:35,528 --> 00:33:37,228
Fire marshmallow!

262
00:33:37,228 --> 00:33:38,228
素晴らしい！
Wonderful!

00:33:38,228 --> 00:33:39,728
Amazing!

264
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:40,728
Let's go!

265
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,228
いい感じじゃない？いい感じじゃない？
Doesn't it look good? Doesn't it look good?

266
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,028
美味しい！
Delicious!

267
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:53,728
What is this? What is this?

268
00:33:53,728 --> 00:33:56,228
What is this? This is perfection.

269
00:33:56,728 --> 00:33:58,228
わくわく！
Exciting!

270
00:34:01,228 --> 00:34:03,228
ごくごくじゃない？ Perfect!
Isn't it "gulp gulp"? Perfect!

00:34:04,728 --> 00:34:05,728
Shall we eat?

272
00:34:05,728 --> 00:34:08,728

How's your marshmallow?

275
00:34:15,028 --> 00:34:16,428
Very smoky.

276
00:34:16,928 --> 00:34:18,028
うまい！
Tasty!

277
00:34:18,728 --> 00:34:20,228
ちょうどいい。
Just right.

278
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:23,228

じゃあ一緒に、レッツ・シング・ア・ソング！
Then, together... Let's sing a song!

284
00:34:37,028 --> 00:34:41,728

287
00:35:18,421 --> 00:35:21,621
追いかけても 追いかけても
Even if I chase after it, even if I chase after it

288
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:26,621
届かない 雲のような
Like a cloud that's out of reach

289
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:30,621
言葉で 表せない
A feeling that can't be expressed

290
00:35:30,621 --> 00:35:34,121
感情 見つけたよ
In words, I found it

291
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:40,121
胸の中で ざわめいてる
Rustling inside my chest

292
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:44,621
波の 本当の意味を
The true meaning of the waves

293
00:35:44,621 --> 00:35:48,621
日差しに 遮られて
Obstructed by the sunlight

294
00:35:48,621 --> 00:35:52,621
私は まだ知らない
I still don't know

295
00:35:54,621 --> 00:35:58,621
あの頃 描いた
What I drew back then

296
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:02,621
絵日記みたい
Like a picture diary

297
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:09,121
すべてが 色づき始める
Everything starts to change color

298
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:10,621
ほら
Look

299
00:36:11,621 --> 00:36:15,621
真夏の空と 海の青さに
In the midsummer sky and the blue of the sea

300
00:36:15,621 --> 00:36:20,621
まぶしくて 目を閉じても
Even if I close my eyes because it's so bright

301
00:36:20,621 --> 00:36:25,121
私の 心の端っこを
The corner of my heart

これが 恋かな
Could this be love?

305
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:59,121
自転車を押し 歩く君の
As you walk pushing your bicycle

00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:03,621
隣で その横顔
Next to you, that profile

307
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:07,621
そっと 見つめていると
When I gaze at you softly

308
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:12,121
呼吸を 忘れてしまう
I forget to breathe

309
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:17,621
子供の頃 見た
Like the kaleidoscope

万華鏡のように
I saw when I was a child

311

自分自身のこと
About myself

323
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:44,121
真夏の空と 海の青さに
In the midsummer sky and the blue of the sea

324
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:49,121
まぶしくて 目を閉じても
Even if I close my eyes because it's so bright

325

優しく響く
Echoing softly

329
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:10,621
そして
And

330
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:15,621
恋が始まる
Love begins

331
00:39:52,621 --> 00:39:59,121
I MET A BEAR

332
00:40:00,725 --> 00:40:01,525
The other day

333
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:02,325
The other day

334
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,125
I met a bear

335
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:03,925
I met a bear

336
00:40:03,975 --> 00:40:04,725
Up in the woods

337
00:40:04,725 --> 00:40:05,525
Up in the woods

338
00:40:05,575 --> 00:40:06,325
Away up there

339
00:40:06,325 --> 00:40:07,125
Away up there

340
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:11,025
The other day I met a bear,

341
00:40:11,025 --> 00:40:14,825
up in the woods away up there.

342
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:15,725
He looked at me

343
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:16,525
He looked at me

344
00:40:16,575 --> 00:40:17,325
I looked at him

345
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:18,125
I looked at him

346
00:40:18,175 --> 00:40:18,925
He sized me up

347
00:40:18,925 --> 00:40:19,725
He sized me up

348
00:40:19,775 --> 00:40:20,525
I sized him up

349
00:40:20,525 --> 00:40:21,325
I sized him up

350
00:40:21,325 --> 00:40:25,225
He looked at me, I looked at him,

351
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:29,125
he sized me up, I sized him up.

352
00:40:29,225 --> 00:40:30,025
He said to me

353
00:40:30,025 --> 00:40:30,825
He said to me

354
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:31,625
Why don't you run

355
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:32,425
Why don't you run

356
00:40:32,475 --> 00:40:33,225
I see you don't

357
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:34,025
I see you don't

358
00:40:34,075 --> 00:40:34,825
Have any gun

359
00:40:34,825 --> 00:40:35,625
Have any gun

360
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:39,525
He said to me why don't you run,

361
00:40:39,525 --> 00:40:43,425
I see you don't have any gun.

362
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:44,325
And so I ran

363
00:40:44,325 --> 00:40:45,125
And so I ran

364
00:40:45,175 --> 00:40:45,925
Away from there

365
00:40:45,925 --> 00:40:46,725
Away from there

366
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:47,525
And right behind

367
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:48,325
And right behind

368
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:49,125
There was a bear

369
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:49,925
There was a bear

370
00:40:49,925 --> 00:40:53,825
And so I ran away from there,

371
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:57,725
and right behind there was a bear.

372
00:40:57,825 --> 00:40:58,625
Ahead of me

373
00:40:58,625 --> 00:40:59,425
Ahead of me

374
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:00,225
I saw a tree

375
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:01,025
I saw a tree

376
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:01,825
A great big tree

377
00:41:01,825 --> 00:41:02,625
A great big tree

378
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:03,425
Oh golly gee

379
00:41:03,425 --> 00:41:04,225
Oh golly gee

380
00:41:04,225 --> 00:41:08,125
Ahead of me I saw a tree,

381
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:12,025
a great big tree, oh golly gee.

382
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:22,125
The lowest branch

383
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:22,925
The lowest branch

384
00:41:22,975 --> 00:41:23,725
Was ten feet up

385
00:41:23,725 --> 00:41:24,525
Was ten feet up

386
00:41:24,575 --> 00:41:25,325
I had to jump

387
00:41:25,325 --> 00:41:26,125
I had to jump

388
00:41:26,175 --> 00:41:26,925
And trust my luck

389
00:41:26,925 --> 00:41:27,725
And trust my luck

390
00:41:27,725 --> 00:41:31,625
The lowest branch was ten feet up,

391
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:35,525
I had to jump and trust my luck.

392
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:36,425
And so I jumped

393
00:41:36,425 --> 00:41:37,225
And so I jumped

394
00:41:37,275 --> 00:41:38,025
Into the air

395
00:41:38,025 --> 00:41:38,825
Into the air

396
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:39,625
But I missed that branch

397
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:40,425
But I missed that branch

398
00:41:40,475 --> 00:41:41,225
Away up there

399
00:41:41,225 --> 00:41:42,025
Away up there

400
00:41:42,025 --> 00:41:45,925
And so I jumped into the air,

401
00:41:45,925 --> 00:41:49,825
but I missed that branch away up there.

402
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:50,725
Now don't you fret

403
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:51,525
Now don't you fret

404
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:52,325
And don't you frown

405
00:41:52,325 --> 00:41:53,125
And don't you frown

406
00:41:53,175 --> 00:41:53,925
I caught that branch

407
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:54,725
I caught that branch

408
00:41:54,775 --> 00:41:55,525
On the way back down

409
00:41:55,525 --> 00:41:56,325
On the way back down

410
00:41:56,325 --> 00:42:00,225
Now don't you fret and don't you frown,

411
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:04,125
I caught that branch on the way back down.

412
00:42:13,225 --> 00:42:14,025
That's all there is

413
00:42:14,025 --> 00:42:14,825
That's all there is

414
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:15,625
There ain't no more

415
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:16,425
There ain't no more

416
00:42:16,475 --> 00:42:17,225
Until I meet

417
00:42:17,225 --> 00:42:18,025
Until I meet

418
00:42:18,075 --> 00:42:18,825
That bear once more

419
00:42:18,825 --> 00:42:19,625
That bear once more

420
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:23,525
That's all there is there ain't no more,

421
00:42:23,525 --> 00:42:27,425
until I meet that bear once more.

422
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:28,325
The end, the end

423
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:29,125
The end, the end

424
00:42:29,175 --> 00:42:29,925

The end, the end

427
00:42:31,525 --> 00:42:32,325
The end, the end

428
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:33,125
The end, the end

429
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:33,925
The end, the end

430
00:42:33,925 --> 00:42:37,825
The end, the end, the end, the end,

431
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:41,725
the end, the end, the end, the end.

The end, the end, the end, the end,

433
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:49,225
the end, the end, the end, the end!

I think you know what time it is now.

466
00:47:02,955 --> 00:47:06,955
Time to pull out the number one businesswoman

Yes, yes, yes.

00:47:52,655 --> 00:47:56,155
That is right. It's a tapestry of me, Mumei,

482
00:47:56,155 --> 00:47:59,555
campin' for you.

483
00:47:59,755 --> 00:48:02,655
For your wall. Make way if your walls

484
00:48:02,655 --> 00:48:04,355
are covered in things.

485
00:48:04,355 --> 00:48:07,155
If your wall is empty, you are so welcome.

486
00:48:07,455 --> 00:48:10,955
It's a B2-sized tapestry.

487
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:15,655
Uh, I think... I really like the art. It's super, super pretty.

488
00:48:15,755 --> 00:48:19,555
And, I don't know, maybe it can inspire you to go outside...

489
00:48:19,555 --> 00:48:21,155
...and look at the stars.

490
00:48:21,255 --> 00:48:24,655
Or maybe it can make you grateful that you have

491
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:26,655
a roof over your head.

492
00:48:26,855 --> 00:48:29,655
There's a lot, lots of things you can do with this.

493
00:48:30,155 --> 00:48:32,655
Mhm. Next up is... こちら！
Mhm. Next up is... here!

MOOM Cap

495
00:48:32,905 --> 00:48:37,155
A hat! A cap! A MOOM Cap!

496
00:48:37,555 --> 00:48:40,355
Called this because it says "MOOM" on it.

497
00:48:40,455 --> 00:48:43,355
What else is there? There is a little owl face. Do you see that?

498
00:48:43,555 --> 00:48:46,455
Do you see that in the "MOOM"? It has my feathers.

499
00:48:46,555 --> 00:48:49,155
You can really tell it's Moom.

500
00:48:49,855 --> 00:48:53,955
Mhm. Yeah. Uh, I don't know, I feel like hats are pretty nice, pretty useful.

501
00:48:54,155 --> 00:48:57,155
You wear them on your head. You can wear them

502
00:48:57,155 --> 00:48:59,355
in whatever direction you so please.

503
00:48:59,455 --> 00:49:02,955
Uh, yeah, really up to you. You have a lot of freedom with this one.

504

It's A Compact Wallet

506
00:49:06,805 --> 00:49:09,355
It's a compact wal— I... I forgot I named it that.

507
00:49:09,555 --> 00:49:12,155
It is. It is a compact wallet.

508
00:49:14,655 --> 00:49:16,955
Uh, yeah. Uh... do we still use wallets today?

509
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,155
I guess we do. Yeah, yeah.

510
00:49:19,355 --> 00:49:23,155
Yeah, you can put uh, money, cards, coins

511
00:49:23,155 --> 00:49:26,155
if you still use those for some reason.

512
00:49:26,655 --> 00:49:30,155
Or... oh! Pro tip! Pro tip from me, Nanashi Mumei...

513
00:49:30,455 --> 00:49:33,655
...the number one businesswoman of Hololive English.

514
00:49:33,855 --> 00:49:36,155
Maybe even Holo— I should probably shouldn't say that.

515
00:49:36,455 --> 00:49:40,155
Uh, you can also use it for the money that you can save...

516
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:45,155
...from combining your purchase, bundling it with other merchandise...

517
00:49:45,655 --> 00:49:48,455
...which will reduce the shipping cost!

518
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:51,255
Pro tip from— I... I said this already.

519
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:55,155
Just... just a little advice. Just putting that out there.

520
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:58,655

531
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,180
...depends how— how big the gaps in your teeth are.

532
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,680

Yes, that's the word. A set, complete set like this.

I pulled an all-nighter, didn't I? The— the sun is rising in the east.

552
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:13,680
I think I got one more song left in me before I have to crash into that tent there.

553
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:19,680
How are you guys holding up? Good for one more song?

554
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,380
Yeah, you are!

555
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:27,980
