00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,360
おはい！
Ohai!

3
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,120
It's me, Nanashi Mumei...

4
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,350
...in 3D!

5
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,450
Oh my goodness!

6
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,900
I, I should probably stand up for this.

7
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,950
Tada!

8
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,780
Yes! おはい、おはい、おはい、おはい！
Yes! Ohai, ohai, ohai, ohai!

9
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,150
Good day!

10
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,250
Good morning!

11
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,550
Good evening!

12
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,150
Get out of bed!

13
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,200
We are moomin' in the 3D today!

14
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,250
Oh, I'm so excited!

15
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,450
But I'm also really nervous.

16
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,850
I am not used to being watched this way.

17
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,650
But it's okay!

18
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,200
I'm just really happy to be here...

19
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,580
...and that I can finally be 3D...

20
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,550
...after two years!

21
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,000
Um, yeah, but before we start...

22
00:05:00,033 --> 00:09:59,033
#MOOMin3D

23
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,233
Before we really get into things,

24
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:01,933
um,

25
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:03,633
may I bring your attention to...

26
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:04,633
...this?

27
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:05,833
The hashtag!

28
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,933
Yes, yes, yes, we have a hashtag for 3D.

29
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:08,833
It is...

30
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,533
...MOOM in 3D.

31
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:11,933
Yes, capital M-O-O-M,

32
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:15,533
lowercase i-n, three, capital D.

33
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:18,533
With a hashtag before that

34
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:20,133
because that's how those work.

35
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,533
Yes, if you, uh,

36
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:23,233
have any thoughts or

37
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,833
any screenshots you want to share, please,

38
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,133
please use that and maybe I can look later,

39
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:29,833
other people can look.

40
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,733
Uh, yeah, it'll be a bunch of fun.

41
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:33,433
Um, yes!

42
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,033
I'm really here in 3D.

43
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:36,233
Hello.

44
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:38,233
Uh, would you guys like a closer look?

45
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:39,933
Pe-pe-pe-perhaps? Perhaps...

46
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,933
...not that close, wait, wait, wait, wait,

47
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:43,233
not there, not there.

48
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,133
Uh, how about we start with...

49
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,233
...the toes?

50
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,333
Just kidding, I have shoes on.

51
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,433
They're cute shoes, aren't they?

52
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,733
Aren't they? They protect the toes.

53
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:55,133
Nice, nice, right?

54
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,933
And I also have... oh, yes,

55
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:59,033
yes, let's appreciate it, let's appreciate it.

56
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:02,133
What exactly? You know what, my...

57
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:03,533
...yes.

58
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:05,733
Uh, take your screenshots now because

59
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,533
we have to keep going, we have to keep going.

60
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,033
Look, look, look, look, look.

61
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:12,133
My accessories! I have my satchel.

62
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:14,933
I have my lantern. It is a miracle

63
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:18,033
I have not set myself on fire with this thing.

64
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,333
Um, then of course I have my dagger.

65
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,933
You didn't forget about my dagger, did you?

66
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:25,733
Uh, well, if you did, you might want to work on

67
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:28,433
improving your memory and your survival skills.

68
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:30,933
Uh, let's see. Keep moving up a bit.

69
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,233
Oh, yes, my bow. My bow, right?

70
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:35,833
You like my bow, right? And then yes,

71
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,133
my face.

72
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,633
Hello, hello.

73
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:42,133
Yes, you've now seen me in full 3D.

74
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:43,933
What the...?

75
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:45,933
You've seen too much. You've seen too much!

76
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:47,833
I'm just kidding.

77
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,833
But now I want to show you guys, look,

78
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,933
my dagger.

79
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:52,533
It's functional. I can use it.

80
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:54,433
I remember how to use it.

81
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:55,933
Stand back.

82
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:57,933
I have the power of Council and 3D on my side.

83
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:01,333
Wait, I'm not supposed to point it at you guys. Oopsie.

84
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,933
Uh, let me just put it back. What the...?

85
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:06,533
Oh, no! Was that too scary?

86
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:08,533
Uh-oh, we have some babies in the chat.

87
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:10,933
Oh no, the poor babies. I better calm them down.

88
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:13,433
Here, watch this, watch this!

89
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,833
Peek-a-boo!

90
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,233
Peek-a-boo!

91
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:21,333
Peek-a-boo!

92
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,233
Peek-a-boo!

93
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:27,233
Peek-a-boo!

94
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:29,333
Peek-a-boo!

95
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,733
See? Cute, right?

96
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:33,833
Cute, cute, cute, cute, cute.

97
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,833
Oh! Should I show you around my treehouse?

98
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,233
You guys have seen it in 2D a lot, but

99
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:40,433
this is your first time seeing it in 3D.

100
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:42,833
There's a lot to share. Come here, come here.

101
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,733
What we got? We got...

102
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:45,433
...caffeine.

103
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:46,833
Oh, don't show Bae. Bae, don't watch.

104
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,533
Um, yes, we have caffeine.

105
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:50,333
We have Kronii's hourglass up there,

106
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,833
you guys remember that.

107
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,833
Uh, what else do we have? Oh, we have...

108
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,833
...the first friend...

109
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,533
...where is he? There he is!

110
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:00,633
The first friend that we ever made.

111
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:03,033
He's in here, you remember him, don't you?

112
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:05,533
Then we have some of Fauna's things. I, uh,

113
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:08,533
I'm not sure what. I also have a heart or something,

114
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:10,033
I think.

115
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:12,133
Um, but yes, we also have my fire.

116
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:14,133
Nice and toasty, nice and warm, right?

117
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,833
And then we have my berry tree right above it.

118
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,433
Totally not a fire hazard. Totally safe.

119
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,233
Plus we have berries all here around.

120
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:23,733
Uh, oh! Over here,

121
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,833
we have my desk.

122
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,133
Usually I have my PC here, but for the sake of

123
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,633
this stream, I threw it away.

124
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,633
So, let's see, we have a map here.

125
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:34,533
We have Bae's dice.

126
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:37,433
We have IRyS's compass, or I guess a compass

127
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,433
I made with parts of IRyS or something.

128
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,833
Um, and oh! The pictures! Don't worry about those.

129
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:46,533
Those windows don't look into anywhere. Don't worry.

130
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:48,333
Oh, I also have some books here.

131
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,533
Yes, very important books about Light,

132
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,933
Height, Sky, Abyss,

133
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,333
Hypothesis... Oh, and Humans! That's pretty important.

134
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,433
As Guardian of Civilization, I should probably

135
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:03,733
have a book about those. They're out of order,

136
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,633
aren't they? Don't worry about it.

137
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,533
Um, let's go over here. Come here, come here.

138
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:11,433
I have more stuff. Oh, I have my bedroom,

139
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:13,633
but no one cares about that, right?

140
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,833
Don't worry about that. Where I sleep?

141
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:16,833
Who cares.

142
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,233
But over here we have the outside.

143
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:21,833
Look at that view! Oh my goodness,

144
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,433
I could never get sick of that.

145
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:27,233
Okay, let's go back inside now.

146
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,133
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

147
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:32,433
Actually, that's about it. That is

148
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:34,533
the treehouse. Smaller than you thought, huh?

149
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,833
But it's perfect for me. Nice and cozy.

150
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,533
Um, yeah. I never really have...

151
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:41,733
...friend! You little bag of sunshine!

152
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:44,533
How are you? You want to say hi?

153
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:47,033
Wait, why are you so angry?

154
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:49,133
What? You have something to say?

155
00:10:00,695 --> 00:10:01,395
Go ahead, say it.

156
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:02,195
Go ahead!

157
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:03,495
What is it?

158
00:10:06,695 --> 00:10:07,995
Yeah, that's what I thought.

159
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:09,195
That's what I thought.

160
00:10:09,345 --> 00:10:10,295
Know your place.

161
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:11,745
Know your place.

162
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:12,795
Get out of here!

163
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:14,345
Get out of here!

164
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:17,345
Sorry, I have to be stern with him.

165
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:19,495
He tried taking over the world again the other day.

166
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:23,045
Ah, he's such a... such a pain in the...

167
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:24,145
No, he's he's fine.

168
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:25,295
Ooh, what was this?

169
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:27,495
Oh, oh, Hootsie!

170
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:29,445
Oh, my precious little Hootsie.

171
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:31,545
Oh, look at you, so cute and so good.

172
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:37,345
What's going on? Are you trying to say something?

173
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:39,145
What is it?

174
00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:40,445
Come on.

175
00:10:40,795 --> 00:10:41,545
What is it?

176
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:43,045
Huh?

177
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:45,395
Did a hooman fall down the well?

178
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:46,895
No?

179
00:10:47,895 --> 00:10:49,195
All right, you can't talk either.

180
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:51,395
No one in here can talk except me. I...

181
00:10:51,595 --> 00:10:52,345
Right, right.

182
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,845
Um... well, how about we...

183
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,695
...play a game to figure out what it is you're trying to say?

184
00:10:58,245 --> 00:11:00,195
And how about we use some hints...

185
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:03,495
...with your little footsie friends!

186
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:06,895
Let's do that!

187
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:14,045
Hootsie's Footsies

188
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:21,095
What are you silly-soons out there?

189
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:22,545
Come on in!

190
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:34,695
Oh, hi!

191
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:43,445
Hmm... I think I could use some help though.

192
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,145
Does anyone in the audience volunteer?

193
00:11:46,945 --> 00:11:47,645
Hello?

194
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:51,545
Me! Me, me, me! Yeah, me, me, me!

195
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:53,045
You, funny-looking kid.

196
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,145
Me? Me?

197
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:54,895
Yeah, you.

198
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:55,745
Who are you?

199
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:58,595
I'm... I... I'm Gura Gura.

200
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:00,945
Gura as in Gura Cheese.

201
00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:02,945
Hello, Gura Cheese.

202
00:12:03,295 --> 00:12:05,145
You're just the person I need for this.

203
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:07,795
Can you help me find Hootsie's footsies?

204
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,395
Yes! Yes!

205
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:13,445
All right, Gura Cheese.

206
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:15,995
Uh, let me explain it to you.

207
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,545
Okay. Hootsie here has left prints around the treehouse.

208
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:25,145
And we have to find what he left prints on.

209
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:28,195
And that's how we will know what he's trying to tell us.

210
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:31,495
We'll have to guess at the end once we find everything.

211
00:12:32,495 --> 00:12:34,895
Deciphering Hootsie's secret.

212
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:35,845
M-hm.

213
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:36,595
Secret.

214
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:37,395
M-hm.

215
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:39,195
Do you have the brain for it?

216
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:40,495
I hope so.

217
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:41,545
I believe in you.

218
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,245
All right.

219
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:46,445
Let's start taking a look around.

220
00:12:46,895 --> 00:12:48,395
Um... Hootsie footsie...

221
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:49,795
...oh Hootsie footsie...

222
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,295
...oh Hootsie footsie.

223
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,545
Um... speaking of feet,

224
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:56,295
should we start from the ground up?

225
00:12:56,595 --> 00:12:57,495
Smart!

226
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,045
Hootsie's where the footsies go.

227
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:01,395
Hootsie footsie footsie.

228
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:02,795
Hootsie footsie footsie.

229
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:04,945
Hootsie's where the footsies go.

230
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:06,045
Hootsie footsie.

231
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:07,195
Hey, wait. Huh?

232
00:13:07,295 --> 00:13:07,845
What's that?

233
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:08,595
What's what?

234
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:09,995
On the... rope.

235
00:13:10,195 --> 00:13:11,145
That thing.

236
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:12,345
Oh, oh!

237
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:13,295
There's rope!

238
00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:14,345
There's red on the rope!

239
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:15,395
Oh, there is a rope!

240
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:16,195
What the...

241
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:17,595
Oh, you found one!

242
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,595
It's a footsie!

243
00:13:18,695 --> 00:13:19,495
It's a footsie! Nice!

244
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:20,495
Okay. Hootsie's footsie.

245
00:13:20,595 --> 00:13:23,045
That's a weird-looking knot, but...

246
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:24,045
Okay. Rope.

247
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:24,895
Rope? Knot?

248
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:25,845
Who knows.

249
00:13:28,195 --> 00:13:29,845
Okay, we have one clue.

250
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:32,095
Let's continue looking.

251
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:34,295
A rope is a clue?

252
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:36,545
I need your... I need your shark vision.

253
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:39,445
My shark vision? Or smell?

254
00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:40,445
Or knot?

255
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:41,245
Smell.

256
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:43,045
Smell, smell knot.

257
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:44,295
You're good at that?

258
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:44,995
Rope.

259
00:13:45,345 --> 00:13:46,395
Let's look up here.

260
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:47,395
Okay.

261
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,295
Ah, on my bookshelf.

262
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,395
Ooh.

263
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:51,895
I have a lot of stuff here.

264
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:54,045
He must have left a print on here somewhere.

265
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:57,145
You have a lot of bottles, empty glass jars.

266
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,195
I do. You want one?

267
00:13:58,395 --> 00:13:59,045
Yeah.

268
00:13:59,145 --> 00:14:00,195
Okay, you can have one.

269
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:01,895
And bread too, yum!

270
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:03,495
Oh yeah, my bread.

271
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:05,195
I've had it for a few years.

272
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:08,045
Oh, don't ask whose eggs those are.

273
00:14:08,545 --> 00:14:09,195
Eggs?

274
00:14:10,595 --> 00:14:11,495
Oh, Hootsie!

275
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:12,395
Huh?

276
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:13,295
On the bread!

277
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:14,345
Bread!

278
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:15,395
Hootsie!

279
00:14:16,895 --> 00:14:18,195
Um... cut, cut...

280
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:19,495
...scissors.

281
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:21,095
That's what they're called. Scissors.

282
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,095
Oh, oh, that's what...

283
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,295
...there's a pink, uh, footsie on the scis...

284
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:26,595
...you're right, you're right. The scissors, the scissors!

285
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:27,545
Let's see.

286
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:29,695
I think that's a footsie or it's blood. Wait.

287
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:30,995
Is it blood?

288
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:32,445
What do you think? Hmm?

289
00:14:32,695 --> 00:14:35,395
I hope it's a footsie. I don't know how to respond if it's blood.

290
00:14:35,695 --> 00:14:38,295
Ah, it looks like jam, so I'm pretty sure it's a footsie.

291
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:39,145
M-hm.

292
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,545
All right, so... scissors and rope.

293
00:14:41,695 --> 00:14:42,545
Rope.

294
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:43,395
We have rope.

295
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:44,595
We have, uh, scissors.

296
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:45,695
Scissors.

297
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:48,395
Probably one more clue, right? 'Cause rule of threes.

298
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:51,295
That's how you know it's good writing.

299
00:14:51,695 --> 00:14:52,495
Okay.

300
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:53,395
Um... Okay.

301
00:14:53,995 --> 00:14:56,895
Scissors, scissors and rope.

302
00:14:56,995 --> 00:14:59,645
I wonder if there's anything else on the bookshelf.

303
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:02,157
Scissors and rope tie a knot.

304
00:15:02,157 --> 00:15:04,657
And together they make...

305
00:15:04,757 --> 00:15:07,557
Su-ice, su-ice, su-ice-ice-ice...

306
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:09,257
A ship knot requires...

307
00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:12,557
Now that's the monkey's fist.

308
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:13,557
What?

309
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:18,557
I thought I saw something, but it's behind me now.

310
00:15:19,557 --> 00:15:21,057
Oh! What is that?

311
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:23,057
Oh! What is that?

312
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:25,057
Oh, I don't... Oh, what are those doing there?

313
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,557
Those should be in my pocket.

314
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:28,057
Oh, it's...

315
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:30,057
Oh, it's... it's handcuffs.

316
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:32,057
There's hand... handcuffs?

317
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,557
That's Hootsie's handcuffs.

318
00:15:34,557 --> 00:15:35,557
Wait, wait, wait.

319
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:36,557
Rope?

320
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:38,257
He remembered scissors...

321
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:39,257
Scissors.

322
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:41,057
...and handcuffs.

323
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:43,057
Handcuffs.

324
00:15:43,557 --> 00:15:45,557
What, Hootsie? Hootsie?

325
00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:50,057
Hootsie turned himself... handcuffs?

326
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:54,557
All right, let's... let's go back here.
Come here, come here.

327
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:58,557
Wait, let's think about it.
What could it be? What could it be?

328
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:03,057
Rope, knot, scissors, handcuffs.

329
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:07,057
Rope, knot, scissors, handcuffs.

330
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:11,057
Do you have any guesses as to what he
could be trying to tell us?

331
00:16:11,557 --> 00:16:13,557
Medieval torture?

332
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:16,857
Me... No.

333
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:21,057
Aw... No... one more guess maybe?
One more, one more.

334
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:24,557
Rope, scissors, handcuffs...

335
00:16:24,557 --> 00:16:26,557
Mhm, those are the things.

336
00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:30,057
Good girl.

337
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:33,057
Hootsie's going to tie us...

338
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:36,557
...to our PCs and stream... tie us, handcuff us...

339
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:41,557
...and threaten us with scissors if we don't stream.

340
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:45,557
Oh, I thought I had that one. Okay.

341
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:50,057
Mmm... I wonder. Maybe three?
Maybe it's not three.

342
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:53,057
Maybe there's more.

343
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:55,557
Oh no, there has to be.

344
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,557
There's not that much space here.

345
00:16:58,257 --> 00:17:02,057
Ah... another clue? Another clue?

346
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:06,057
See anything red? I see red... something quite...

347
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:07,557
Not the berries...

348
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:09,557
Behind you! Behind you!

349
00:17:10,057 --> 00:17:11,057
Hmm?

350
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:12,857
Oh! It's our friend! Friend!

351
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:17,557
Now, now, friend. No, this show isn't about
Friend. No, no, no, Friend...

352
00:17:17,557 --> 00:17:19,057
Go away, go away, go away.

353
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:21,057
Friend! Hello Friend!

354
00:17:21,057 --> 00:17:22,557
Oh, inside! Oh, Friend!

355
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:25,557
Oh... he does have a Hootsie! So there are four.

356
00:17:25,557 --> 00:17:27,557
I was going to say two. There are four clues.

357
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:30,057
Hmm...

358
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:32,057
Wow... Wow...

359
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:34,057
I think I know what it is.

360
00:17:34,057 --> 00:17:35,857
Do you know what it is, Gura?

361
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:38,557
I was going to say Hootsie's going
to get rid of Friend...

362
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,557
...once and for all, but maybe I'm wrong.

363
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:43,557
Is that it?

364
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:45,557
That's what I thought.

365
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:48,557
Beep beep!

366
00:17:49,057 --> 00:17:51,057
That's pretty dark, Gura.

367
00:17:51,057 --> 00:17:53,057
That is wrong with you.

368
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:58,557
Um... well... okay. How about... let me take a guess.
Let me take a guess.

369
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:02,557
Could it be that Hootsie wants to
make friendship bracelets?

370
00:18:04,057 --> 00:18:05,557
What?!

371
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:09,057
Of course! No, Hootsie is precious.

372
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:10,557
Friendship bracelets!

373
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:13,557
Hootsie, where are your beads?
Where are your beads, boy?

374
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:16,557
What kind of friendship bracelets
are you making?

375
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:19,057
No, use strings, you make strings.

376
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:22,557
Real ones! No, the ones with knots. Real ones!

377
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:24,557
What do you mean?

378
00:18:24,557 --> 00:18:30,557
The ones that use cute colored thread and not rope
used to tie up kidnapping victims?

379
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:32,057
Yeah! Wait, what?

380
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:34,557
You don't need beads for those. No, the ones...

381
00:18:34,557 --> 00:18:37,057
...you do the knots and it becomes a V.

382
00:18:37,057 --> 00:18:40,057
You know, and you use the special foam thingy...

383
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:44,057
...but it's like colorful soft thread to
make it pink and purple and...

384
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,557
I know exactly...

385
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,057
That's rope.

386
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:51,557
That's... that's very cute, Hootsie.
It's A for effort, Hootsie. A for effort.

387
00:18:51,557 --> 00:18:53,557
Good job.

388
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:58,557
I'm sorry, Hootsie. And good job...
that's a very kind gesture.

389
00:18:58,557 --> 00:19:00,057
Good job to you, Gawr Gura.

390
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,557
Haha, I did my best.

391
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,557
You did a very good job, didn't you,
little Gawr Gura?

392
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:08,557
What a... come here... come here...

393
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:12,557
Well, thank you, kind audience member.
Thank you, Mumei.

394
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:17,057
Thank you for having me.
I will see you in your dreams.

395
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:22,557
In my dreams? I'm going to go to sleep
right now. Okay, goodnight.

396
00:19:22,557 --> 00:19:24,557
Goodnight! Thank you, Gura!

397
00:19:24,557 --> 00:19:26,557
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

398
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:28,057
Bye-bye!

399
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:36,557
Man, I should really keep inventory of all the stuff
I have here. What else do I have?

400
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:40,057
Oh yeah! My gavel!

401
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:44,557
I totally forgot about this thing.

402
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:47,057
Here, do you want a don-don?

403
00:19:47,057 --> 00:19:49,057
Don-don!

404
00:20:06,735 --> 00:20:07,835
Oh hi!

405
00:20:07,835 --> 00:20:09,602
You're finally awake.

406
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,835
Welcome!

407
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,502
I brought you guys outside,

408
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:15,569
yes, dragged you into the sun.

409
00:20:17,502 --> 00:20:20,269
Um, yeah, I've brought you to these ancient ruins

410
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:22,469
in a distant land that I found.

411
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:25,635
Um, I think I'm the only one who's been coming here

412
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:27,235
ever since this civilization fell.

413
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:29,069
Not sure how it fell.

414
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:31,002
Before you ask, it wasn't me.

415
00:20:31,135 --> 00:20:32,469
I do know that.

416
00:20:32,469 --> 00:20:33,469
It wasn't me.

417
00:20:33,635 --> 00:20:35,402
All of this was not my doing,

418
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,435
it wasn't my fault.

419
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:39,535
Take a look around.

420
00:20:39,702 --> 00:20:41,635
Look how magnificent it is here.

421
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:43,369
Or, maybe I guess it was.

422
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:47,402
But it's still pretty cool in a different way.

423
00:20:47,902 --> 00:20:49,769
It looks like nature took over.

424
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:52,069
There's a bunch of growth, there's a bunch

425
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:55,402
of shrubs and moss and leaves.

426
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:57,669
But it's not fun as quite yet,

427
00:20:57,935 --> 00:20:59,102
not yet.

428
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:00,669
Still mine.

429
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:02,569
I do have some things to show you.

430
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:04,035
I found some things.

431
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:06,202
Do you want to see? Do you want to see?

432
00:21:06,202 --> 00:21:07,502
Do you want to see?

433
00:21:07,502 --> 00:21:10,102
Well you have to, I'm taking you with me. Let's go!

434
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,835
Come, come, come.

435
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:19,535
Okay, I have dug a little hole here

436
00:21:19,535 --> 00:21:21,102
kind of like my own little excavation site.

437
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:23,769
Um, there's some artifacts in here

438
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:25,869
that I wanted to show you guys.

439
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,235
And I thought maybe we could figure out

440
00:21:28,235 --> 00:21:30,402
what the heck kind of civilization this was

441
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:32,469
by looking at what was left behind.

442
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:34,302
Let's take a look-see here.

443
00:21:34,302 --> 00:21:35,802
I gotta kneel down.

444
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:40,869
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

445
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:42,569
Oh, first thing...

446
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,269
this.

447
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:47,435
What is this? What is... what's... what...

448
00:21:48,935 --> 00:21:50,069
There you go.

449
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:51,335
What's it look like?

450
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:52,602
Oh, it looks magical.

451
00:21:52,735 --> 00:21:56,469
It's got some Egyptian hieroglyphs?

452
00:21:58,335 --> 00:22:00,769
Uh, we're not in Egypt.

453
00:22:01,469 --> 00:22:04,169
Maybe somebody went on vacation

454
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:06,402
and took it back or something.

455
00:22:06,635 --> 00:22:07,835
Guess what it says.

456
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:10,035
I don't remember how to read this.

457
00:22:10,035 --> 00:22:11,435
Can any of you decode this?

458
00:22:12,502 --> 00:22:14,435
If you can figure out what it says,

459
00:22:14,435 --> 00:22:15,602
please share with the hashtag.

460
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,702
Or if you figure it out, share it in chat.

461
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:22,135
Probably isn't something too important.

462
00:22:22,502 --> 00:22:23,602
Hmm, interesting.

463
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:26,635
Alright, well, I guess we know that

464
00:22:26,635 --> 00:22:28,502
this civilization could travel a bit.

465
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:30,935
What else do we got? What else do we got?

466
00:22:35,402 --> 00:22:37,569
Ooh, do you guys know what this is?

467
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:40,102
Have you seen this before? It looks like a cup.

468
00:22:40,469 --> 00:22:41,935
It is a cup.

469
00:22:42,302 --> 00:22:43,669
But not just any old cup.

470
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:45,135
It's a Pythagoras cup.

471
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:47,869
Have you heard of it?

472
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:50,502
It's basically a practical joke

473
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,902
from like the 6th century BC.

474
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:55,335
Yeah, I will explain it to you, I'll show you.

475
00:22:55,735 --> 00:22:58,402
See inside the cup, there's a column here.

476
00:22:58,402 --> 00:23:00,335
And in the column there's a little pipe,

477
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:03,069
little hole that goes... (slurp) ...and it

478
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:04,669
empties out at the bottom.

479
00:23:05,702 --> 00:23:08,835
So if you're filling this with some type of fluid,

480
00:23:09,202 --> 00:23:11,035
if it goes past the column,

481
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:12,835
the liquid will start to flow,

482
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:14,735
and flow out of the cup and spill onto you.

483
00:23:14,735 --> 00:23:16,935
Spill onto whoever is holding the cup.

484
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:19,535
I think it was to discourage people

485
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:22,469
from being greedy and drinking too much.

486
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,535
Oh, I can show you,

487
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:26,402
I happen to have some berry juice. Hold on.

488
00:23:27,535 --> 00:23:29,069
See, berry juice.

489
00:23:29,502 --> 00:23:32,469
Okay, I'll show you. They fill it up...

490
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:35,935
Oh, it's full!

491
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:37,935
You see?

492
00:23:38,935 --> 00:23:40,469
And... oh!

493
00:23:41,335 --> 00:23:42,935
Oh no! It's...

494
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:45,135
Oh, watch, watch, watch, watch!

495
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:47,535
Oh, that's not too bad. That's okay.

496
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,435
Got a little red stain on your dress shirt.

497
00:23:50,435 --> 00:23:52,535
That'd be awkward to explain,

498
00:23:53,135 --> 00:23:55,402
explain how you got that.

499
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,169
Yeah, that's how it works.

500
00:23:59,502 --> 00:24:01,102
So why is this here?

501
00:24:01,102 --> 00:24:02,935
It has an owl too. What are the chances?

502
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:04,735
Why is this here?

503
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,935
Did somebody take a vacation to Greece

504
00:24:06,935 --> 00:24:08,935
and bring it back, maybe?

505
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:12,235
Are we learning anything? Have we...

506
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,435
Are we figuring anything out here?

507
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:15,635
What else do we have?

508
00:24:18,502 --> 00:24:20,469
Ooh, this...

509
00:24:21,535 --> 00:24:24,535
Whoa, it's heavy! (grunting)

510
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:27,502
Look! What is this?

511
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:29,469
It's a Viking sword!

512
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,502
It's a really old Viking sword.

513
00:24:31,702 --> 00:24:33,469
It's freaking huge! Wait...

514
00:24:33,502 --> 00:24:35,469
Is it bigger than me? Hold on.

515
00:24:37,402 --> 00:24:38,669
Is it? Oh...

516
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:40,435
Not quite. It's pretty big though.

517
00:24:41,535 --> 00:24:43,369
How do people carry this?

518
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:46,169
Whoever this belonged to must have been a lot bigger than me.

519
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:49,935
Whoa, my gosh, it's huge!

520
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:52,635
It's okay, I'm strong though, I can... (swings) ...phew!

521
00:24:55,435 --> 00:24:57,735
My goodness, it's so cool though. The Vikings...

522
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,281
Has anybody visited Denmark?

523
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:02,181
Wait.

524
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:04,581
Maybe... nobody visited Denmark,

525
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:07,081
maybe Denmark visited here.

526
00:25:08,581 --> 00:25:10,581
Did this ancient civilization fall

527
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:13,081
because the Vikings visited?

528
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:16,881
Maybe. Or maybe someone did visit Denmark.

529
00:25:17,581 --> 00:25:20,581
I think it's more interesting to think that...

530
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:23,081
Vikings came in and razed this city, civilization.

531
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:24,981
So we're going to go with that.

532
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:28,181
So we learned something, I guess.

533
00:25:28,181 --> 00:25:30,081
Is there anything else in here?

534
00:25:30,581 --> 00:25:32,581
Anything else? We learned how...

535
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:34,081
it's uh... if the civilization fell,

536
00:25:34,081 --> 00:25:36,581
but what... what civilization was this?

537
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:40,081
And what's this doing here? Huh?

538
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,581
Who the heck is this?

539
00:25:42,581 --> 00:25:45,081
Who the... heck?

540
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:47,581
Who is this?

541
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:51,581
Actually, you kind of look familiar.

542
00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:54,881
I know you. Oh, I remember you.

543
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:57,081
Oh, good times, good times. How you been?

544
00:25:57,881 --> 00:25:59,581
Probably not well. Um...

545
00:26:00,581 --> 00:26:03,581
Interesting. I guess it makes sense to find...

546
00:26:03,581 --> 00:26:06,081
human remains at an excavation site.

547
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:08,581
I guess that makes sense.

548
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:11,581
Um, I'm just gonna... put you back.

549
00:26:11,581 --> 00:26:13,081
Uh, nice to see you again.

550
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,581
I don't think we can figure out what civilization

551
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:19,081
this was based on all of that.

552
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:21,281
Why are these things here?

553
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:23,081
How did this happen?

554
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:25,581
You know what?

555
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:27,581
It might have been me.

556
00:26:27,581 --> 00:26:29,081
This might be my stuff.

557
00:26:29,581 --> 00:26:31,281
Oh yeah, yeah. This is my stuff.

558
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:33,581
Oh right, right, right, right.

559
00:26:33,581 --> 00:26:35,081
I... I left this stuff here.

560
00:26:35,581 --> 00:26:37,081
This is my secret stash.

561
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:38,581
Oh, it's good I found it again.

562
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:41,081
Had a bunch of interesting things to show you.

563
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:42,581
Oh, that explains it.

564
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:45,081
But I still don't want this stuff.

565
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:47,081
Do any of you want these things?

566
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:49,081
Maybe I can sell them.

567
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:50,581
I wonder how much they're worth.

568
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:52,081
Am I allowed to sell that skull?

569
00:26:52,581 --> 00:26:54,081
I'm sure it's fine.

570
00:26:54,081 --> 00:26:56,081
Look out for it on Moon-bay later.

571
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:59,081
Anyways. Anyways, I think that's enough...

572
00:26:59,181 --> 00:27:01,081
uh, can I get up? Wait a second.

573
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:03,581
Okay. That's enough education, I think

574
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,081
for one stream. Are your brains

575
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,081
craving something else?

576
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:09,581
That was boring, right? Are you craving

577
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:11,081
pretty colors and dancing

578
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:13,581
and singing and magic?

579
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:16,081
Will that satisfy your brain?

580
00:27:16,881 --> 00:27:19,581
Well, good for you! We are now going to enter

581
00:27:19,581 --> 00:27:22,581
the singing performance dancing part

582
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:24,081
of the 3D debut.

583
00:27:25,581 --> 00:27:28,081
I have prepared... uh, quite a few

584
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:30,081
performances for you guys.

585
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:34,081
Um, I should probably go get ready for those.

586
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:37,081
I will be back... to prepare,

587
00:27:37,081 --> 00:27:38,581
both physically and mentally.

588
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:40,081
This is going to be fine. Okay.

589
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:42,581
I'll be back. See you in a second.

590
00:27:42,581 --> 00:27:44,081
Bye bye bye!

592
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:17,581
She lost her brother months ago

593
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:26,581
His picture on the wall and it reminds me

594
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:33,081
When she brings me coffee, her smile

595
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:40,081
I wish I could be with her until my last day

596
00:28:41,081 --> 00:28:46,581
She said she gave all her love to me

597
00:28:47,081 --> 00:28:53,081
We dreamt a new life, some place to be at peace

598
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:59,081
But things changed suddenly

599
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:06,081
I lost my dreams in this disaster

600
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:13,581
I'm crying, missing my lover

601
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:19,581
I don't have the power, on my side forever

602
00:29:20,081 --> 00:29:26,581
Oh, where is my lover?

603
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:30,081
And I don't have the power,

604
00:29:30,081 --> 00:29:33,081
I'm standing alone, no way

605
00:29:36,581 --> 00:29:46,081
Calling out your name

606
00:30:00,493 --> 00:30:05,493
I said, I'll give all my love to you.

607
00:30:05,493 --> 00:30:13,293
Dreamed a new house, some place to be at peace.

608
00:30:13,293 --> 00:30:18,593
But things changed suddenly.

609
00:30:18,593 --> 00:30:26,393
I lost my dreams in this disaster.

610
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:32,493
We don't know what is wrong tonight.

611
00:30:32,493 --> 00:30:38,993
Everybody's got no place to hide.

612
00:30:38,993 --> 00:30:45,393
No one's left and there's no one to go on.

613
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:52,393
All I know is my life is gone.

614
00:31:05,193 --> 00:31:09,593
I'm crying, missing my lover.

615
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:18,793
I don't have the power on my side forever.

616
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:24,093
Oh, where is my lover?

617
00:31:24,093 --> 00:31:28,193
And I got no power.

618
00:31:28,193 --> 00:31:35,393
I'm standing alone, no way.

619
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:42,593
Calling out your name!

620
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:27,793
Tada! That was "Call your name". I hope you
enjoyed and didn't feel... uh, too much anguish.

621
00:32:27,793 --> 00:32:35,393
Uh, I just had a realization that all of the songs
I'm going to perform today are kind of depressing.

622
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:38,293
But I'm fine! Everything's fine!

623
00:32:38,293 --> 00:32:42,793
But now I will have guests join me
for some performances.

624
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:48,593
They will join me for this very emo section
of the debut... the 3D debut.

625
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:52,293
Uh, but who could it be? Who will be next?

626
00:32:52,293 --> 00:32:55,393
Stay tuned to find out!

627
00:32:55,393 --> 00:33:03,093
I mean, I should ready myself. Okay, I'm ready,
I'm ready. da da da da da... I'm ready.

628
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:13,593
僕がずっと前から思ってることを話そうか
Shall I tell you what I've been thinking
for a long time?

629
00:33:13,593 --> 00:33:17,693
友達に戻れたらこれ以上は望まないさ
If we could go back to being friends,
I wouldn't ask for more.

630
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:22,593
君がそれでいいなら僕だってそれで構わないさ
If you're fine with that,
I'm fine with it too.

631
00:33:22,593 --> 00:33:28,093
嘘つきの僕が吐いた反対言葉の愛のうた
A love song of opposite words
spoken by a liar like me.

633
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:51,193
今日はこっちの地方はどしゃぶりの晴天でした
Today in this area,
it was a downpour of clear skies.

634
00:33:51,193 --> 00:33:56,193
昨日もずっと暇で一日中忙しかった
Yesterday was also free all day,
I was busy the whole time.

635
00:33:56,193 --> 00:34:00,893
別に君のことなんて考えてなかったりしなかったり
I wasn't exactly not thinking about you,
or maybe I was.

636
00:34:00,893 --> 00:34:05,893
いやでもちょっと本当は考えてたかもなんて
No, but actually,
maybe I was thinking about you a bit.

637
00:34:05,893 --> 00:34:08,893
メリーゴーランドみたいに回る
Spinning like a merry-go-round.

638
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:13,693
僕の頭ん中もグルグルさ
Inside my head is spinning round and round too.

639
00:34:13,693 --> 00:34:18,493
この両手から零れそうなほど
So much that it seems to spill from these hands,

640
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:22,893
君に貰った愛はどこに捨てよう
where should I throw away
the love I received from you?

641
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:27,793
限りのある消耗品なんて僕は
Limited-life consumables, I...

642
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:32,493
要らないよ
...don't need them.

643
00:34:32,493 --> 00:34:37,093
僕がずっと前から思ってることを話そうか
Shall I tell you what I've been thinking
for a long time?

644
00:34:37,093 --> 00:34:41,893
姿は見えないのに言葉だけ見えちゃってるんだ
Even though I can't see you,
only your words are visible.

645
00:34:41,893 --> 00:34:46,593
僕が知らないことがあるだけで怖くなりそうだ
I feel like I'm getting scared just by
there being things I don't know.

646
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:51,393
ぶら下がった感情が綺麗なのか汚いのか
Whether these dangling emotions
are beautiful or dirty,

647
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:56,493
僕にはまだわからず捨てるあてもないんだ
I still don't know,
and I have no place to throw them away.

648
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,705
僕はずっと裏の裏の裏まで
I'll keep waiting until I can see...

649
00:35:04,705 --> 00:35:08,845
見えるまで待つからさ 待つくらいならいいじゃないか
...every hidden side of yours. It's okay to wait, isn't it?

650
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:13,105
切ない君と隣り合った
With you, so full of sorrow, beside me...

651
00:35:13,105 --> 00:35:16,505
僕の行き止まらない月日を
...how should I fill...

652
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:18,905
何で埋めよう
...these endless days of mine?

653
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:23,305
まだ素直に言葉にできない
I, who still can't put my feelings...

654
00:35:23,305 --> 00:35:26,505
僕を
...into words honestly...

655
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,925
天ノ弱虫さ
A contrarian weakling.

656
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:34,505
この両手から零れそうな程
Whom shall I give this love to...

657
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:37,705
君に渡す愛を誰に譲ろう?
...that's overflowing from my hands?

658
00:35:37,705 --> 00:35:41,305
そんな何処にも宛てがある
There's no way I have anyone else...

659
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,855
わけないだろ
...to give it to.

660
00:35:45,155 --> 00:35:48,405
まだ待つよ
Still... I'll wait.

661
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,405
まだ待つよ
Still... I'll wait.

662
00:35:51,505 --> 00:35:55,005
もういいかい?
Are you ready yet?

663
00:36:16,305 --> 00:36:19,105
Woo! Mumei, congratulations!

664
00:36:19,205 --> 00:36:21,105
Thank you, Towa-sama!

665
00:36:21,205 --> 00:36:25,105
That's right! I invited Towa-sama!

666
00:36:25,205 --> 00:36:28,905
I invited her because of the history we have together...

667
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:30,605
...all our memories.

668
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:33,305
We played FPS together...

669
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:35,005
...then we had English lessons together...

670
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:37,105
...and now we sing together!

671
00:36:38,305 --> 00:36:43,105
えー、はい。あの、FPSやったりとか、英語教室とか一緒にやったよ、みたいな。
Yes, like, we played FPS and had English lessons together.

672
00:36:43,205 --> 00:36:47,405
だから呼んだよ、みたいな言ってくれました。
She said that's why she invited me.

673
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:52,405
え、そしてね、配信ではそうやって遊んでたけど...
And, although we played like that on stream...

674
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:56,605
カラオケに行ったことあるんだよね、日本のカラオケ。
...we've been to karaoke together, Japanese karaoke.

675
00:36:57,105 --> 00:37:00,105
でも、その時はムメイがソーナーバス、恥ずかしいって言って...
But at that time, Mumei was so nervous and shy...

676
00:37:00,205 --> 00:37:04,305
...トワと一緒に歌ってくれなかったの！
...that she wouldn't sing with me!

677
00:37:05,205 --> 00:37:12,605
でも今日は一緒に歌ってくれました！Today together song with Towa! No shy today!
But today, she sang with me! Today! Together! Song! With Towa! No shy today!

678
00:37:13,305 --> 00:37:15,605
Yes! You know, Towa-sama...

679
00:37:16,205 --> 00:37:18,105
Do you remember English?

680
00:37:19,505 --> 00:37:22,105
Oh, a little. A little.

681
00:37:23,605 --> 00:37:25,605
え、ムメイは日本語覚えてる？
And Mumei, do you remember Japanese?

682
00:37:26,605 --> 00:37:28,605
あ、少し日本語覚えています。
Ah, I remember a little Japanese.

683
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:30,605
お、上手！
Oh, skillful!

684
00:37:31,305 --> 00:37:33,305
Hmm, that gives me an idea.

685
00:37:33,505 --> 00:37:38,305
How about we make each other say things in English and Japanese?

686
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:43,105
So I will say something in English and Towa-sama will repeat...

687
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:48,105
...and Towa-sama will say something in Japanese and I will repeat. Yes?

688
00:37:48,605 --> 00:37:50,105
Okay, Towa-sama...

689
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:54,705
...please explain in Japanese. 日本語お願いします。
...please explain in Japanese.

690
00:37:55,305 --> 00:37:58,305
はい！オッケーです。今ムメイがね、良いこと思いついたと。
Yes! Okay. Mumei just thought of something good.

691
00:37:58,505 --> 00:38:02,905
ムメイ、トワでお互いに言わせたい日本語、英語を言うのはどうかな？
How about Mumei and Towa tell each other Japanese or English words we want the other to say?

692

00:46:49,629 --> 00:46:52,129
Oh, so cute! So cute!

854
00:46:52,129 --> 00:46:54,129
Oh, one more! One more time! One more!

855
00:46:54,629 --> 00:46:57,129
Go up. Up. Up.

856
00:46:57,629 --> 00:47:00,129
Up, Hooty! Perfect! Okay.

857
00:47:01,129 --> 00:47:05,129
Okay, せーの！ チーズ！
Okay, ready! Cheese!

858
00:47:05,629 --> 00:47:08,129
Yes! Nice! Okay, Mumei, last shot.

859
00:47:08,629 --> 00:47:10,629
Last one! Okay, okay, okay.

860
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:14,629
Oh, he's in his nest. Okay, back in the nest. Perfect.

861
00:47:15,129 --> 00:47:18,629
On top of Mumei! I love you Hooty!

862
00:47:19,129 --> 00:47:23,129
Okay, ready? せーの！ チーズ！
Okay, ready? Ready! Cheese!

863
00:47:25,129 --> 00:47:27,629
Okay. Oh, Mumei. Bye!

864
00:47:28,129 --> 00:47:30,129
Oh, goodbye! Goodbye!

865
00:47:30,629 --> 00:47:34,129
ころね先輩、来てくれてありがとうございました。
Korone-senpai, thank you very much for coming.

866
00:47:34,129 --> 00:47:35,629
こちらこそありがとうね。バイバイ。
Thank you too. Bye bye.

867
00:47:35,629 --> 00:47:38,129
Bye bye. Oh, oh, she's taking Hooty with her.

868
00:47:38,129 --> 00:47:41,129
Ah, he'll be fine. It's okay.

869
00:47:53,429 --> 00:47:55,429
No title

870
00:47:55,429 --> 00:47:57,429
Lyrics/Composition: Reol

871
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,629
ずっとなりたかった僕になれたかな
Did I become the person I always wanted to be?

872
00:48:04,629 --> 00:48:07,629
到底抗えないところまできてみたい
I want to reach a point where I'm completely unstoppable

873
00:48:07,629 --> 00:48:09,629
自分の足で地を蹴飛ばして
Kicking the ground with my own feet

874
00:48:09,629 --> 00:48:12,629
もっと先へ駆け抜けていけるはずだから
Because I should be able to run even further

875
00:48:12,629 --> 00:48:14,129
On the way...

876
00:48:14,129 --> 00:48:16,629
ずっと鳴り止まなくて
It won't stop ringing

877
00:48:16,629 --> 00:48:19,129
ずっとばち当たりに這い回りたかった
I wanted to crawl around like a curse

878
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:22,129
慣れた痛み 焦る呼吸とbeat
Familiar pain, racing breath and beat

879
00:48:22,129 --> 00:48:24,129
気づかない振りして待つひとり
Pretending not to notice, waiting alone

880
00:48:24,129 --> 00:48:26,629
相反する内なるエゴ
Conflicting inner ego

881
00:48:26,629 --> 00:48:28,629
誰か間違いだと言い放つまで
Until someone says it's a mistake

882
00:48:28,629 --> 00:48:31,129
あんたが大嫌いなアイツはきっと
That person you hate so much is surely

883
00:48:31,129 --> 00:48:33,129
誰かそれだけが正解なんだって
The only correct answer for someone

884
00:48:33,129 --> 00:48:37,629
前線だって逆戦したって 全然納得できない理由も
Even on the front lines, or even if I fight back, reasons I can't accept at all

885
00:48:37,629 --> 00:48:40,129
宣戦もいつだってここだった
The declaration of war was always here

886
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:42,629
存在を今日最初から待った
I waited for my existence from the beginning today

887
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:47,129
夕焼空に崩れ壊れていく
Crumbling and breaking into the sunset sky

888
00:48:47,129 --> 00:48:50,129
ゆらりゆらり首を絞めるように
Swaying, swaying, as if strangling my neck

889
00:48:50,129 --> 00:48:52,629
日の目の僕が殺されていく
The "me" in the sunlight is being killed

890
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:56,629
夕焼空に離ればなれや
Parting ways in the sunset sky

891
00:48:56,629 --> 00:48:59,629
どなりに君に聞こえるのは
What you hear next to you

892
00:48:59,629 --> 00:49:02,629
僕の知らない声になって
Is becoming a voice I don't know

893
00:49:10,129 --> 00:49:14,129
幼い日の僕ならば 気づいたらそばにいた
If it was the me of my childhood, I found you by my side before I knew it

894
00:49:14,129 --> 00:49:17,129
まるで月夜のようだ
It's like a moonlit night

895
00:49:17,129 --> 00:49:21,129
都会 君だけと手を繋いで
In the city, holding hands with only you

896
00:49:21,129 --> 00:49:23,629
楽しいことも涙も
Fun things and tears too

897
00:49:23,629 --> 00:49:26,629
全部君に話して聞かせていた
I told you and let you hear them all

898
00:49:26,629 --> 00:49:29,129
僕を笑う人へ貶す声
The voices of people belittling me, laughing at me

899
00:49:29,129 --> 00:49:31,629
掻き消すように君は歌った
You sang as if to drown them out

900
00:49:31,629 --> 00:49:35,629
この声を君が信じて支えてこれたから
Because you believed in and supported this voice

901
00:49:35,629 --> 00:49:38,129
嘘だって言って去って
Saying it was a lie and leaving

902
00:49:38,129 --> 00:49:40,629
詰まらない敗北さえとかい
In the face of boring defeats or whatever

903
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:43,129
一瞬巡る窓ただ一瞬だけでも
A window passing for a moment, even for just a moment

904
00:49:43,129 --> 00:49:46,129
交わる言葉を繋ぐ色
Connecting colors that join words

905
00:49:46,129 --> 00:49:49,129
次は僕が君に歌うから
Next, I will sing for you

906
00:49:49,129 --> 00:49:53,629
夕焼空に崩れ壊れていく
Crumbling and breaking into the sunset sky

907
00:49:53,629 --> 00:49:57,129
ゆらりゆらり首を絞めるように
Swaying, swaying, as if strangling my neck

908
00:49:57,129 --> 00:49:59,629
日の目の僕が殺されていく
The "me" in the sunlight is being killed

909
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:00,129
夕焼空に...
In the sunset sky...

910
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:02,141
揺らめか、放れ合え
Swaying, drifting apart

911
00:50:02,441 --> 00:50:06,741
ゆらり君に聞こえぬは 僕ら知らない顔になって
Gently, what you can't hear turns into a face we don't know

912
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:11,541
ゆらゆら、髪 擦れこぼれ落ちる
Swaying, hair swaying and spilling over

913
00:50:12,141 --> 00:50:16,541
ゆらりゆらり、首を締められるように 日の目、僕ら解かされていく
Gently, gently, as if being strangled, sunlight, we're being dissolved

914
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:20,741
揺らめか、放れ合え
Swaying, drifting apart

915
00:50:21,141 --> 00:50:25,541
ゆらり君に聞こえぬは 僕ら知らない声になって
Gently, what you can't hear turns into a voice we don't know

916
00:50:26,841 --> 00:50:30,541
いつか君に打ち解けない そうな日はきっと来ないだろうな
The day we won't get along will surely never come

917
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:35,141
声も体も持たぬ君に 救われた何億人の一人
One of the hundreds of millions saved by you who have neither voice nor body

918
00:50:36,141 --> 00:50:40,141
赤、青、合わせ彩った 劣る世界が溢れた
Red, blue, mixed and colored, a lesser world overflowed

919
00:50:40,641 --> 00:50:44,641
巡り巡り、出会ったこの音を聞くすべてが
Round and round, everything that hears this sound we met

920
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:50,541
ゆらゆら、髪 揺られこぼれ落ちる
Swaying, hair swaying and spilling over

921
00:50:51,641 --> 00:50:55,741
ゆらりゆらり、首を締められるように 日の目、僕ら解かされていく
Gently, gently, as if being strangled, sunlight, we're being dissolved

922
00:50:56,641 --> 00:51:00,141
揺らめか、放れ合え
Swaying, drifting apart

923
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:04,741
ゆらり君に聞こえぬは 僕ら知らない顔になって
Gently, what you can't hear turns into a face we don't know

924
00:51:06,641 --> 00:51:10,641
ゆらゆら、髪 揺られこぼれ落ちる
Swaying, hair swaying and spilling over

925
00:51:11,141 --> 00:51:15,141
ゆらりゆらり、首を締められるように 日の目、僕ら解かされていく
Gently, gently, as if being strangled, sunlight, we're being dissolved

926
00:51:16,141 --> 00:51:19,541
揺らめか、放れ合え
Swaying, drifting apart

927
00:51:20,141 --> 00:51:24,141
ゆらり君に聞こえぬは 僕ら知らない顔になって
Gently, what you can't hear turns into a face we don't know

928
00:52:01,441 --> 00:52:03,541
Woo! Oh my god! Congratulations!

929
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:06,141
Happy birthday, Mumei!

930
00:52:06,141 --> 00:52:07,541
Thank you Polka-senpai! Yes!

931
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:10,141
I invited Polka-senpai because...

932
00:52:10,641 --> 00:52:14,641
...she was so nice to us when we first debuted to Council.

933
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:17,641
She's been so welcoming to EN.

934
00:52:17,641 --> 00:52:22,141
And... and she made me a berry house in Minecraft!

935
00:52:22,141 --> 00:52:25,141
So I... I... I wanted to invite her.

936
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,641
Mumei's berry house. Yeah, yeah.

937
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:27,641
Berry house. Okay.

938
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:30,141
Mm-hm. Remember.

939
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:32,141
浴衣が似合うね
You look good in a yukata

940
00:52:32,141 --> 00:52:34,141
うなじもいいね
Your neckline looks nice too

941
00:52:34,141 --> 00:52:36,641
さあ、ここでムメに分かんないことを言ったところで...
Well, having said something Mumei doesn't understand...

942
00:52:38,141 --> 00:52:39,641
No title.

943
00:52:40,141 --> 00:52:43,141
Mm, beautiful, perfect. No title wa...
Mm, beautiful, perfect. "No title" is...

944
00:52:43,141 --> 00:52:47,141
七詩ムメイだから、ムメイでNo Title!
Since you're Nanashi Mumei, "Mumei" means "No Title"!

945
00:52:47,141 --> 00:52:48,141
どう?
How's that?

946
00:52:48,141 --> 00:52:49,141
Ah, なるほど!
Ah, I see!

947
00:52:49,141 --> 00:52:50,141
なるほど!
I see!

948
00:52:50,141 --> 00:52:52,141
Ah, I didn't think of that.

949
00:52:52,141 --> 00:52:54,141
That's genius!

950
00:52:55,141 --> 00:52:56,641
That's genius!

951
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:57,641
偶然?
Coincidence?

952
00:52:58,641 --> 00:52:59,641
え、たまたま?
Eh, was it random?

953
00:52:59,641 --> 00:53:00,641
Polka-senpai genius!

954
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:02,641
頭がいい!
Smart!

955
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:04,641
You genius. Oh!

956
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:06,141
Mumei is genius.

957
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,641
I'm a genius without knowing.

958
00:53:10,141 --> 00:53:12,141
Geniuses!

959
00:53:12,141 --> 00:53:14,141
そうだ! これから、あの...
That's right! From now on, um...

960
00:53:17,141 --> 00:53:19,641
Hootsie, Hootsie, Hootsie 預かったのよ。
Hootsie, Hootsie, I took care of Hootsie.

961
00:53:22,141 --> 00:53:24,141
Hootsie, ちゃんと休憩した?
Hootsie, did you rest properly?

962
00:53:25,141 --> 00:53:26,141
したよ!
Yes he did!

963
00:53:26,141 --> 00:53:28,141
Yeah, I think he's ready to have some more fun.

964
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:29,641
帰るよ? じゃあね!
Going home? See ya!

965
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:31,641
仕事終わり?
Done with work?

966
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:33,641
Oh no no no no! Come back, come back!

967
00:53:33,641 --> 00:53:36,141
Come back here! No no, time for more fun.

968
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:38,141
まだ仕事か...
Still working, huh...

969
00:53:39,141 --> 00:53:41,641
これ、さっきやってたけど飛ぶ? Fly? Hootsie fly?
We were doing this earlier, but does he fly? Fly? Hootsie fly?

970
00:53:42,141 --> 00:53:44,141
Oh, I want to see him fly!

971
00:53:44,141 --> 00:53:45,141
Fly する?
Does he fly?

972
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:47,141
Yeah, we have to help him fly though.

973
00:53:51,641 --> 00:53:53,141
スポーツやりますか?
Do you want to play sports?

974
00:53:57,141 --> 00:54:00,141
Perfect. We're going to punt him so that he flies.

975
00:54:00,141 --> 00:54:02,141
We're going to kick him.

976
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:05,641
Hootsie! Yeah!

977
00:54:08,141 --> 00:54:09,641
大丈夫? 大丈夫?
Are you okay? Are you okay?

978
00:54:10,141 --> 00:54:12,641
全然感じない! 痛みを! 感じない!
I don't feel anything! The pain! I don't feel it!

979
00:54:13,141 --> 00:54:14,141
感じない!
I don't feel it!

980
00:54:14,141 --> 00:54:15,641
痛みを感じない!
I don't feel any pain!

981
00:54:23,141 --> 00:54:25,141
Hootsie! すごいすごいすごい!
Hootsie! Amazing, amazing, amazing!

982
00:54:25,641 --> 00:54:26,641
He likes it!

983
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:29,141
痛そうに鳴いてる... え、え、え、してる。
He's crying in pain... eh, eh, eh, he's doing that.

984
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:31,141
No, no! He's okay! He's okay.

985
00:54:31,141 --> 00:54:32,141
大丈夫?
Is he okay?

986
00:54:33,141 --> 00:54:34,641
Polka-senpai, please... kick him.

987
00:54:35,141 --> 00:54:36,641
へ? Kick him? Kick him?
Eh? Kick him? Kick him?

988
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:40,141
どうやってやるの?
How should I do it?

989
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:43,141
行けーっ! うわー!
Go! Whoa!

990
00:54:43,641 --> 00:54:46,141
Perfect! Hootsie, did you see that?

991
00:54:50,141 --> 00:54:52,141
Fly, owl, fly!

992
00:54:53,141 --> 00:54:55,141
Look at him, he's flying. Come here.

993
00:54:55,641 --> 00:54:57,141
恐ろしい子だ...
What a terrifying child...

994
00:54:57,141 --> 00:55:00,141
Very good. I think... I think that's enough of that.

995
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:01,953
うちは… 今日は、うーん…
I'm... for today, hmm...

996
00:55:02,253 --> 00:55:05,553
But first actually, how about a photo?
Do you want to take a photo?

997
00:55:06,253 --> 00:55:07,953
Hey girl, look! 写真？ 写真！
Hey girl, look! Photo? Photo!

998
00:55:08,153 --> 00:55:09,653
写真！
Photo!

999
00:55:09,653 --> 00:55:10,653
写真！ Picture!
Photo! Picture!

1000
00:55:10,653 --> 00:55:12,253
Let's take a photo!

1001
00:55:12,353 --> 00:55:14,453
Okay! Okay, one second.

1002
00:55:15,653 --> 00:55:17,953
本当は痛いんだよな お前
Truth is, it hurts, doesn't it?

1003
00:55:18,153 --> 00:55:20,153
我慢してるんだよな
You're holding it in, aren't you?

1004
00:55:20,253 --> 00:55:21,653
Alright, ready?

1005
00:55:21,953 --> 00:55:24,053
Ready... せーの！
Ready... Go!

1006
00:55:24,153 --> 00:55:27,353
Cheeeeeese!

1007
00:55:27,453 --> 00:55:29,153
Phew! One more? One more!

1008
00:55:29,253 --> 00:55:31,153
One more, one more!

1009
00:55:39,653 --> 00:55:41,653
せーの！
Ready, go!

1010
00:55:41,753 --> 00:55:43,153
Cheese!

1011
00:55:43,253 --> 00:55:45,953
Perfect! Perfect!

1012
00:55:47,153 --> 00:55:49,153
Ah, thank you Polka-senpai!

1013
00:55:49,253 --> 00:55:51,353
聞いてくれてありがとうございました
Thank you very much for listening!

1014
00:55:51,453 --> 00:55:54,153
Thank you, thank you! Bye-bye!

1015
00:55:54,653 --> 00:55:56,653
Polka, ね、帰ろっか？
Polka, hey, shall we go home?

1016
00:56:00,253 --> 00:56:02,153
大丈夫、大丈夫…
It's okay, it's okay...

1017
00:56:02,253 --> 00:56:04,653
Yeah, Mumei hug! Oh!

1018
00:56:04,753 --> 00:56:06,653
Bye-bye!

1019
00:56:11,153 --> 00:56:13,653
She'll be fine. She'll be fine, it's okay.

1020
00:56:14,153 --> 00:56:17,653
Um, you know, I have some
more announcements to give you guys.

1021
00:56:17,953 --> 00:56:21,153
Uh, let's go to the treehouse
and I'll tell you there.

1022
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:23,653
Ta-ta-ta... oh, not that way. Ta-ta-ta...

1023
00:56:34,653 --> 00:56:36,653
Tada! We're back in the treehouse.

1024
00:56:37,153 --> 00:56:42,153
I thought we could warm ourselves up a little bit
just before the last song.

1025
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:45,153
Sure would be nice to have a fire outside.

1026
00:56:45,253 --> 00:56:46,153
Contained.

1027
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,153
You know, contained in something.

1028
00:56:48,653 --> 00:56:54,153
And then it could produce a light source and it could
guide us to a hot spring or a volcano or something.

1029
00:56:54,653 --> 00:56:57,953
Hmm, what could we get that would be like that?

1030
00:56:59,653 --> 00:57:03,653
Oh duh! My lantern! Oh how silly of me.

1031
00:57:04,153 --> 00:57:06,653
It's so handy-dandy for such things.

1032
00:57:07,153 --> 00:57:09,153
You guys don't have one, do you?

1033
00:57:09,253 --> 00:57:10,653
Suckers.

1034
00:57:11,153 --> 00:57:15,153
Just kidding. You're in luck,
because now I can offer you...

1035
00:57:18,253 --> 00:57:21,153
A lantern of your own! Just like mine!

1036
00:57:21,253 --> 00:57:26,653
Wow! Incredible! That's right,
merchandise! It's merchandise time.

1037
00:57:21,253 --> 00:58:18,653
Mumei's Lantern

1038
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:29,653
Um, yes, you can get a lantern like mine.

1039
00:57:30,153 --> 00:57:32,153
Except this one's made of silicone.

1040
00:57:32,253 --> 00:57:33,653
And there's no fire.

1041
00:57:34,153 --> 00:57:36,653
And it doesn't produce heat,
so it's not hot to the touch.

1042
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:40,153
But it produces light! That's pretty
nice, right? That's pretty nice.

1043
00:57:40,653 --> 00:57:43,653
You can put it next to your bed,
you can put it on your desk...

1044
00:57:44,153 --> 00:57:48,653
Anywhere you need a little
extra light in your... in your life.

1045
00:57:49,153 --> 00:57:51,653
It can protect you from monsters in your closet.

1046
00:57:52,153 --> 00:57:57,653
Or it can show you whatever's watching you
in the dark... or you don't really need it for that, right?

1047
00:57:58,653 --> 00:58:01,153
But yeah, lantern! Just like mine!

1048
00:58:01,253 --> 00:58:04,653
If you want it, yes, 3D merchandise!

1049
00:58:05,153 --> 00:58:09,653
Who could have expected? Oh my god.
Yes, I'm the best at... at shilling. Okay.

1050
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:14,653
Anyways, yes, please feel free
to get one if you need it, if you want it.

1051
00:58:15,153 --> 00:58:18,653
Oh god. Okay. That's it for the merchandise.

1052
00:58:19,153 --> 00:58:22,153
But I got one more song for you guys.

1053
00:58:22,253 --> 00:58:25,653
Shall I go do it? Shall I go... go there to do it?
I'll do that.

1054
00:58:26,153 --> 00:58:28,653
Let's go! Follow me! Let's go, let's go!

1055
00:58:28,753 --> 00:58:32,153
Ta-ta-ta... oh so pretty! Oh nice!

1056
00:59:01,153 --> 00:59:06,153
Binary Star

1057
00:59:10,953 --> 00:59:13,653
In a turbulence star

1058
00:59:14,153 --> 00:59:17,353
We can see from afar

1059
00:59:17,653 --> 00:59:20,353
But a truth it divides

1060
00:59:20,653 --> 00:59:23,353
All the interest it dies

1061
00:59:23,653 --> 00:59:26,353
Hear the beating of wings

1062
00:59:26,653 --> 00:59:29,653
As the pendulum swings

1063
00:59:29,953 --> 00:59:35,153
And we can't believe it's ever gonna end

1064
00:59:35,653 --> 00:59:41,153
You know birds are the curve in the water

1065
00:59:41,653 --> 00:59:49,153
We would just want everyone to get along

1066
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:54,153
Or the candles in the darkness

1067
00:59:54,653 --> 00:59:57,353
Burning out the sorrow

1068
00:59:57,653 --> 01:00:00,153
There's no end to sadness

1069
01:00:00,165 --> 01:00:01,550
We didn't learn

1070
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:05,639
For the broken-hearted people

1071
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:08,988
Time is now surrounds us

1072
01:00:08,988 --> 01:00:10,988
So out of our mind

1073
01:00:10,988 --> 01:00:14,801
Leave the path behind

1074
01:00:14,801 --> 01:00:17,597
Our binary heart

1075
01:00:17,597 --> 01:00:20,834
To each other apart

1076
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:23,879
Growing from the same stem

1077
01:00:23,879 --> 01:00:27,068
They were us, we were them

1078
01:00:27,068 --> 01:00:30,177
On a course to collide

1079
01:00:30,177 --> 01:00:33,080
Is it straight not to hide

1080
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:36,799
Let the politics decide

1081
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,277
You're not a friend

1082
01:00:39,277 --> 01:00:44,540
And blood is thicker than water

1083
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:51,688
But you just want everyone to get along

1084
01:00:53,908 --> 01:00:57,677
For the candles in the darkness

1085
01:00:57,677 --> 01:01:00,788
Burning out the sorrow

1086
01:01:00,788 --> 01:01:03,909
There's no end to sadness

1087
01:01:03,909 --> 01:01:06,577
We didn't learn

1088
01:01:06,577 --> 01:01:09,899
For the broken-hearted people

1089
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:12,676
Time is now surrounds us

1090
01:01:12,676 --> 01:01:15,098
So out of our mind

1091
01:01:15,098 --> 01:01:18,687
Leave the path behind

1092
01:01:18,687 --> 01:01:23,509
Binary

1093
01:01:23,509 --> 01:01:26,376
A centrifugal force

1094
01:01:26,376 --> 01:01:29,198
Push us far away

1095
01:01:29,198 --> 01:01:31,509
That's our identity

1096
01:01:31,509 --> 01:01:36,420
Binary

1097
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,098
We can't escape the force

1098
01:01:39,098 --> 01:01:40,687
Push us

1099
01:01:40,687 --> 01:01:43,876
Gravity is our identity

1100
01:02:09,287 --> 01:02:12,999
For the candles in the darkness

1101
01:02:12,999 --> 01:02:16,476
Burning out the sorrow

1102
01:02:16,476 --> 01:02:19,687
There's no end to sadness

1103
01:02:19,687 --> 01:02:22,298
We didn't learn

1104
01:02:22,298 --> 01:02:25,787
For the broken-hearted people

1105
01:02:25,787 --> 01:02:28,598
Time is now surrounds us

1106
01:02:28,598 --> 01:02:30,809

01:02:30,809 --> 01:02:34,287
Leave the path behind

1108

There's no end to sadness

Push us

1123
01:03:21,476 --> 01:03:24,687
Gravity is our identity
