Lyrics: KIRA / Composer: KIRA

5
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,800
Lying down on the floor late night

6
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,600
and you don't know, don't know, don't know what to do

7
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,200
Hard to tell what's wrong, what's right,

8
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,000
if yes or no, don't know, don't know what to do

9
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,400
The storm hits hard and you're losing the way,

10
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,600
just take a chance and dance in the rain

11
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,300
Cause you've got the key, never throw it away,

12
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,000
don't forget, don't forget what I said

13
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,400
Get out of your head,

14
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,200
life is only what you make it,

15
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
you're gonna be okay

16
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,400
So go ahead and do it, do it,

17
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,700
if you want it let's get to it,

18
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,000
everybody's gonna know your name

19
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,500
Cause sparks like the flame through the dark of the night,

20
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,200
until today, don't stop, don't stop, just go your own way

21
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,300
So don't be afraid, trust your heart,

22
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,100
keep your head in the game, keep up, keep up, and never be afraid

23
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,600
Gotta make it hot like a volcano, set a match and burn it up,

24
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,300
kick your feet against the table to the beat of your own drum

25
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
Sparks like...

26
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,167
Sparks light the flame, so don't wait

27
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,994
start a fire today.

28
00:05:03,994 --> 00:05:06,169
Just go your own way.

29
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:08,802
Ain't looking back, take the fast lane now,

30
00:05:08,802 --> 00:05:11,411
the driver's seat's strapped and it's gas poured out.

31
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,418
Going so fast and it shouldn't be allowed,

32
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:15,578
that's how we like it.

33
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:17,505
You heard what I said.

34
00:05:17,505 --> 00:05:20,174
Get out of your head,

35
00:05:20,174 --> 00:05:22,214
life is only what you make it,

36
00:05:22,214 --> 00:05:24,271
you're gonna be okay.

37
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:27,083
So take a step and move it, move it,

38
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,512
unless you try you won't get through it,

39
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:32,255
everybody's gonna know your name.

40
00:05:32,255 --> 00:05:34,941
Cuz sparks light the flame,

41
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:37,525
turn the dark of the night into day.

42
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:40,958
Don't stop, don't stop, just go your own way.

43
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,498
Don't be afraid,

44
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:46,045
trust your heart, keep your head in the game.

45
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,033
Keep up, keep up, and never be afraid.

46
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:57,101
Let go of the past tonight,

47
00:05:57,101 --> 00:06:00,161
choose the future only you define.

48
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:02,844
Even when the flames burn too bright,

49
00:06:02,844 --> 00:06:05,533
you're alive, from the ashes you rise!

50
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,807
Cuz sparks...

51
00:06:23,807 --> 00:06:27,392
Don't stop, don't stop, just go your own way.

52
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:29,860
Don't be afraid,

53
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,474
trust your heart, keep your head in the game.

54
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:35,113
Keep up, keep up, and never be afraid.

55
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:37,926
Gotta make it hot like a volcano,

56
00:06:37,926 --> 00:06:40,433
strike a match and burn it!

57
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:46,497
Start a fire today.

58
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:49,947
Don't stop, don't stop, just go your own way,

59
00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:52,033
higher!

60
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:20,433
Kikeriki!

61
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:22,433
Hi everybody!

62
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:26,352
My voice, it works! It's working! Ah!

63
00:07:26,352 --> 00:07:29,264
Hi KFP! Oh wait, wait, wait.

64
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:32,357
You have so much to react to, you have me to react to,

65
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:35,033
but you have this place to react to, right?

66
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,401
Oh my god!

67
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:40,490
Yes, we started with a banger, we started with Sparks.

68
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,033
One of your favorites, I think, right?

69
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:44,730
Same for me!

70
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,100
Kikeriki! みなさん、おはようございます！
Kikeriki! Good morning, everyone!

71
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,188
Yay!

72
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:54,162
It's Takanashi Kiara from Hololive English 1st Generation Myth. Yeah!

73
00:07:54,162 --> 00:07:57,214
It's real! Oh my god! Yes, this is KFP!

74
00:07:57,214 --> 00:08:00,033
Whoa! So many details! We shall look around. Ooh!

75
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:25,601
Hi! Oh, what's your name?

76
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:27,799
Harry? Harry, oh, nice to meet you, Harry.

77
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,315
How you doing today? What are you eating?

78
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:34,234
Oh, he's eating the Yagoo Burger!

79
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:37,313
Which is also on the menu up there, yeah!

80
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:40,265
And also the chicken bucket. Oh my god!

81
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:42,584
How you eating so much alone?

82
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:46,936
I can't even relate. He's eating way too much.

83
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:51,881
Two pieces of fries, Yagoo Burger, a shake probably, Oreo shake...

84
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:54,575
and the chicken bucket! Damn!

85
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:58,247
Ooh, I'm also getting hungry, hungry!

86
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:01,385
Let's look around a bit more.

87
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:04,687
We have the menus up there.

88
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:08,604
Inspired by, of course, the real KFC menu,

89
00:09:08,604 --> 00:09:10,990
cuz this is the real deal.

90
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,258
There's hot dogs, hamburgers, Smart...

91
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:17,411
What the hell is a Smart Burger? I don't know.

92
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:20,966
Who decided on that one? I don't know anything about the Smart Burger.

93
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:23,036
Do I get smart if I eat that?

94
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:25,572
And we have the Phoenix Burger, of course.

95
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:28,941
Yagoo Burger apparently is black, I didn't know about that.

96
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:31,294
So much good-looking stuff!

97
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:34,858
And we have a kitchen in the back. Everything! Yay!

98
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:38,901
It's so cheap! I think it's cheap.

99
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:43,947
Let's say hi to Jimmy who just hatched again.

100
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:45,507
Jimmy!

101
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:47,421
People always worry about you, Jimmy.

102
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:51,714
How you doing? You're alive again! Yay!

103
00:09:51,714 --> 00:09:54,525
You know, I ate you recently, so I felt like

104
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:58,033
you deserved to be reborn. Jimmy!

105
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:02,545
Look at my sweet boy...

106
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:04,545
Yes, our too cute little boy.

107
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:05,545
Look at him! Look at him!

108
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:08,545
Look! Such a good boy. Oh!

109
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:11,845
He's in his uniform. He's ready to... uh...

110
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:15,545
...work right as he has been hatched immediately.

111
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:18,545
He wants to get to work. He's frightened?

112
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:20,545
He's not frightened.

113
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:22,545
怖くないよね？
You're not scared, are you?

114
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:24,445
You're not scared. Yes, yes.

115
00:10:24,445 --> 00:10:27,545
Actually he can, I think he can walk a little bit.

116
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:29,545
動けるんだっけ？
Can he move?

117
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,045
I think he can walk.

118
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:34,045
Let's go! Let's go, Jimmy. Let's go to work.

119
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:36,545
Let's go to work, Jimmy. He's so cute!

120
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:40,545
Okay. I pick you up because you're so baby in your heart.

121
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:43,045
Blink twice if you need help.

122
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:45,045
No, he cannot blink.

123
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,545
He's incapable of blinking. Hmm.

124
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:51,545
Franzie, don't say that. Well, actually...

125
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:53,845
...he's not the only one, right? There's more people working here.

126
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:55,245
もっといるよね？
There are more, right?

127
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:56,545
店員さん！
Employees!

128
00:10:56,545 --> 00:10:57,845
Where's all the others?

129
00:10:57,845 --> 00:11:00,545
Where are you guys? どこ...？
Where are you guys? Where...?

130
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:02,545
Oh my god! So many! So many!

131
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:04,545
You're ready for your shift?

132
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:09,545
Hi! Hi! Oh! Hi, hi! Oh!

133
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:13,545
So many KFP, maybe some new ones, some old ones.

134
00:11:13,545 --> 00:11:17,045
Wow!

135
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:19,545
わあ、いっぱい来てくれてる。
Wow, so many have come.

136
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,545
仕事が始まったからね。
Because work has started.

137
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:23,545
Yeah, you're ready. Me too!

138
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:25,045
Ha!

139
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:28,545
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, this is... imagine this is you guys.

140
00:11:28,545 --> 00:11:32,045
It might be Jimmy but just imagine it's you.

141
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:34,045
Osho, osho, osho.

142
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:37,045
So proud of you, so proud. Ready for your shift?

143
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:40,545
Well, actually, I think there is more.

144
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:43,045
Okay, bye-bye, go get to work, go get to work.

145
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:45,545
Hush, go get to work.

146
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:48,545
I'm gonna go get to work too.

147
00:11:48,545 --> 00:11:52,545
(Humming) Tututututu...

148
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,045
Hi!

149
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:57,045
And welcome to KFP!

150
00:11:57,045 --> 00:11:59,045
いらっしゃいませ！
Welcome!

151
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:02,545
Uh, smiles are for free, I guess.

152
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:05,545
スマイルは無料です。
Smiles are for free.

153
00:12:05,545 --> 00:12:08,545
Tehe, tehe. Hmm, so we have a register...

154
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:13,545
...so I can, you know, take your change... or not,

155
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:17,545
I take your money, I give you change.

156
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:20,545
Here, five cents, there you go. はい、どうぞ。
Here, five cents, there you go. Here you go.

157
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:23,545
Hmm, and then... (bell rings) Ding ding ding ding!

158
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:26,545
Don't do that on me, okay? Just don't do that.

159
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,545
Be quiet. Don't ding-ding-ding-ding me.

160
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:32,045
No Karens allowed either, no, no.

161
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:34,045
Only good customers and good employees.

162
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,045
Yeah, and then up here, I already showed you the menus,

163
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:40,045
in the back there's menus, the kitchen working hard.

164
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:43,045
Are you working hard or hardly working? What was that?

165
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:46,545
How do you say that? (Laughs)

166
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:49,545
I could also go back there, but not right now, not right now.

167
00:12:49,545 --> 00:12:53,045
I think we should play a game, okay? Alright, alright.

168
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:58,045
We're gonna play the game.

169
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:04,045
Love is just a game, I can't complain, I do the same. Oh!

170
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:07,545
Well, actually, no, no, no, not a game.

171
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:09,545
It's real business. It's the real stuff.

172
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:12,045
I am Tenchou after all. So, I think we need to prove it,

173
00:13:12,045 --> 00:13:15,045
'cause you guys sometimes doubt me, right? No doubting allowed.

174
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:25,045
I have only best ingredients prepared.

175
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:28,545
We have some chicken, the famous one! Ooh!

176
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:32,045
(Chomp noises)

177
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:35,045
Om-nom-nom-nom. Om-nom-nom-nom.

178
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:38,545
Oh, that's the good stuff. It's perfectly seasoned,

179
00:13:38,545 --> 00:13:41,545
perfectly crispy, as it should be. We have the bucket!

180
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:45,545
Ooh! The KFP bucket! Which... is it still an emote?

181
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:49,045
If it's still an emote, you guys gotta post it,

182
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:52,545
but... did I take it down?

183
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:56,545
It at least used to be a chat emote for a long time.

184
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,545
Hmm, I'm not sure. Is it gone? It's not?

185
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:03,045
Ah! I had to get rid of it. Oopsie, well, imagine.

186
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,545
And then we have some ingredients. We have the tomatoes,

187
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:13,045
some salad, pickles, and we have cheese with... um... onions.

188
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:17,545
And we have several patties. And now this is the difficult part

189
00:14:17,545 --> 00:14:21,045
because there's three pieces of bread. We have the top one,

190
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:24,045
the middle one, and the... the bottom one.

191
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:29,045
I've never had a burger before which has a middle part

192
00:14:29,045 --> 00:14:32,045
because I know I can't eat it alone. Oh, well, well, well.

193
00:14:36,045 --> 00:14:40,045
Before we play the game, can I drink some water?

194
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,545
水飲んでもいいかな？ちょっと待って。
Can I drink some water? Wait a moment.

195
00:14:50,045 --> 00:14:53,045
Okay, okay, okay. I think, thank you, thank you.

196
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:55,545
I'm back. Okay. I'm ready to play the game.

197
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:58,545
Hydration, yay! So... ah, not, of course not a game...

198
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:01,407
This is real, real work.

199
00:15:01,457 --> 00:15:04,007
It's called... uh, what's it called?

200
00:15:04,257 --> 00:15:06,057
配膳ゲームもやりましょう。
Let's do the serving game too.

201
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:10,057
Serving game - 配膳ゲーム -
Serving game - Food Service Game -

202
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,657
Serving game!

203
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:10,557
Yay!

204
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:14,257
Okay, what does that entail? I think you can guess...

205
00:15:14,257 --> 00:15:15,557
...by looking at the stuff.

206
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:19,457
I'm going to be looking at the screen to see...

207
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:21,857
...what I have to make for the customer.

208
00:15:22,057 --> 00:15:23,557
And then I'll make it, and we'll see if it's right.

209
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,557
But I have to remember it.

210
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:30,057
Will my memory hold up?

211
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:32,457
さて、どうでしょう？
Well, how will it go?

212
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:34,557
All right, figure it out.

213
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:36,557
Bring it on, baby! Bring it on!

214
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:38,257
Bring it on! Bring it on!

215
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:40,057
かかってこい！
Bring it on!

216
00:15:40,157 --> 00:15:41,457
スタート！
Start!

217
00:15:46,557 --> 00:15:49,057
Bottom, patty, middle... No!

218
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:53,057
What? What? Okay, I think I have to...

219
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:55,057
...freestyle some of this.

220
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,057
I think it was another patty, maybe.

221
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:02,057
And then some... something green.

222
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:03,557
But not all of this.

223
00:16:04,557 --> 00:16:05,557
I don't remember!

224
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:06,857
And then look at that.

225
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:10,557
I don't know.

226
00:16:11,257 --> 00:16:13,357
I'm not sure about this one.

227
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,557
合ってるかな？
Is it correct?

228
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:22,557
え？
What?

229
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:24,557
It was almost right. It was just...

230
00:16:24,557 --> 00:16:26,557
...this, this one.

231
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:31,557
こっちだった。
It was this one.

232
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,557
This would have been the right... yeah.

233
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:37,557
あー、やっちゃった！
Ah, I messed up!

234
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:40,057
But it's not fair! It's not fair!

235
00:16:41,057 --> 00:16:43,057
One more, one more, one more.

236
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:48,057
Let's put it back.

237
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:50,057
And then we'll do the next one.

238
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:53,557
All right, this time, this time... This was warmup. Okay.

239
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:56,557
Round two! Go!

240
00:17:01,257 --> 00:17:03,557
Can I already start? But I don't...

241
00:17:09,557 --> 00:17:11,557
Eh? Oh, I really don't remember.

242
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:14,057
I'm so nervous. You can't do this to me.

243
00:17:14,257 --> 00:17:16,557
I think there was like at least one chicken in there.

244
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:18,557
え？わかんない、わかんない。
What? I don't know, I don't know.

245
00:17:18,857 --> 00:17:21,057
I think I chose the wrong one.

246
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:24,057
Cause that was not the top one.

247
00:17:24,257 --> 00:17:26,557
I mean, who knows what they do to bamboozle me.

248
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:29,557
No way! No way, no way!

249
00:17:29,557 --> 00:17:31,557
なんか違うような...
Something feels wrong...

250
00:17:31,857 --> 00:17:33,257
I'm nervous!

251
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:35,057
Give me a break, please.

252
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:37,057
Well, I don't know, so let's just go with this.

253
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,557
違うだろう。
It's wrong, right?

254
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:44,557
I don't know! Okay.

255
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:56,057
Yeah, the real thing is... え？待って。
Yeah, the real thing is... What? Wait.

256
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:58,557
How was I even supposed to build that?

257
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:00,557
Like, it's impossible. 無理でしょ。
Like, it's impossible. It's impossible, right?

258
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:03,557
You're making me create things that are not even possible.

259
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:07,557
I'm so angry I have to go drink some tea.

260
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:11,057
ちょっと待って。
Wait a second.

261
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,557
And we have one more round, I think.

262
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:20,557
Okay, let me take this apart.

263
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:24,557
Angry tea. What the...

264
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:28,057
Okay, let's not swear in my big, big 3D stream.

265
00:18:33,557 --> 00:18:35,057
Let's try.

266
00:18:38,557 --> 00:18:41,057
It's probably just going to get more difficult from this on, right?

267
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:43,557
もっと難しくなるよね。
It'll get even more difficult, right?

268
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:49,057
Round three, please!

269
00:18:49,557 --> 00:18:51,057
スタート！
Start!

270
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:54,557
Bread, salad, bread, meat...

271
00:18:54,557 --> 00:18:58,557
...chicken, meat, bread. Okay.

272
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:02,057
Bread, if I say that out loud, I think I remember.

273
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:04,557
Bread, salad...

274
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:07,057
Which one?

275
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:15,057
Bread, salad... I'll just go with this one.

276
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:19,557
Because I think I would have said cheese if it was the other one, right?

277
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:22,557
Bread, salad, bread, meat...

278
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:27,557
...chicken, meat.

279
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:30,557
If I get this right, you guys invite me for a burger, right?

280
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:34,557
Ah, 順番が曖昧ですけど。
Ah, the order is a bit vague, but...

281
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:37,557
I think you're not, maybe not sure what order this is, but...

282
00:19:39,057 --> 00:19:41,557
I'll go with this! これにします。
I'll go with this! I'll go with this one.

283
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,057
これにします。
I'll go with this one.

284
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,057
お願いします！
Please!

285
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:47,557
No! No!

286
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:51,557
No, what was it?

287
00:19:55,557 --> 00:19:58,557
Ya ya ya ya ya! No, そもそも...
Ya ya ya ya ya! No, in the first place...

288
00:19:58,557 --> 00:20:00,057
そもそも...
To begin with...

289
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,369
Not even cheese in the picture,

290
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:03,169
how am I supposed to remember that?

291
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,969
Cheese is ないぞ! 画像!
There's no cheese! In the picture!

292
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:06,969
What? But besides that I was right.

293
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:08,569
それ以外は合ってた?
So besides that, I was correct?

294
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:09,969
さすが。
As expected.

295
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:19,169
This is weak!

296
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:20,569
No, that's really weak though.

297
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:21,569
嘘でしょ!
No way!

298
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:26,369
Well, I mean... in the end, this is your job.

299
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:29,869
This is your job. Not my job.

300
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:33,469
I am just here to observe, that's my job. Okay?

301
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:36,569
Well... so, I think it's better

302
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,169
if I just do mostly idol work

303
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:41,969
and dancing and singing, right?

304
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:44,369
Mainly...

305
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,469
踊る方向でいきます。
I'll go in the direction of dancing.

306
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:49,269
And you guys do the work, okay?

307
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:51,369
Well then, with that... next song!

308
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:55,769
Let's turn this place into a disco!

309
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:28,169
I'm tired of the same song

310
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:31,969
every day like it's on repeat

311
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:36,669
I need a risky break down

312
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:40,469
oh honey the night is calling

313
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:44,469
Don't need a steady simple melody

314
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:48,369
can you make it a bit unnatural

315
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:52,469
Take me away like it's just the two of us

316
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:55,969
I'm ready

317
00:21:56,369 --> 00:21:58,369
Do you feel the music baby?

318
00:21:58,469 --> 00:22:00,369
Meet me underneath the strobe light

319
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:02,869
Come alive

320
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:05,169
move my feet to something new

321
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:07,969
I don't need no drinks tonight

322
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:11,269
Give me that beat get me dancing

323
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:12,769
feel it rush through me

324
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:16,069
Let this music take over me

325
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:19,969
intoxicating DJ keep playing

326
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:40,069
Lately I'm dancing alone

327
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:44,169
so robotic so emotionless

328
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:48,169
But then I see you across the dance floor

329
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,969
so now honey follow me

330
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:55,969
I need a brilliant red hot melody

331
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:59,669
something to keep me up all night

332
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:03,869
Don't look away now it's just the two of us

333
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:05,669
I'm ready

334
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:08,269
Do you feel the music baby?

335
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:10,569

00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:15,569

338
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:18,269

この心の音を　合わせてよ Follow my heartbeat
Sync with the sound of this heart, follow my heartbeat

342
00:23:27,969 --> 00:23:31,269
バダバダバダバビバ　聴かせてあげる
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-bi-ba, I'll let you hear it

343
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,869
心のバタバタバティ　合わせて Follow my heartbeat
The flutter in my heart, sync it up, follow my heartbeat

344
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:38,869
Crazy for your rhythm

345
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:41,869
I'm in a trance with the way that you're moving

346
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:43,969
You got me shining glowing like a prism

347
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:45,969
That disco ball makes me wild

348
00:23:45,969 --> 00:23:48,369
Don't care who's watching us so baby

349
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:52,669
Meet me underneath the strobe light come alive

350
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:55,769
moving my feet to something so new

351
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:58,369
I don't need no drinks tonight

352
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:01,369
Give me that beat get me dancing

353
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:02,869
feel it rush through me

354
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:06,169
I don't need no drinks tonight

355
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:08,669
give me that beat get me dancing

356
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:11,169
Feel it rush through me

357
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:14,369
baby can we dance until the daylight

358
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:19,469
Crazy about this sound I'm making with you

359
00:26:14,711 --> 00:26:18,081
Yay! I wasn't muted! That was on purpose.

360
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:21,211
That was a transition, guys!

361
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:23,781
Like a commercial, yeah!

362
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:30,211
Did you enjoy the night at my own personal disco, hmm?

363
00:26:30,511 --> 00:26:35,411
Basically, it was like, as you guys were saying it in the chat, I think.

364
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,911
But basically you get food and you get a performance.

365
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:42,941
Is there something like this already existing?

366
00:26:43,011 --> 00:26:45,441
If not, then absolute genius.

367
00:26:45,681 --> 00:26:48,411
And even if, then still genius, right? Yeah.

368
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:54,681
Yeah, that was like a disco ball, and the floor was disco, everything was disco!

369
00:26:55,841 --> 00:26:57,681
Ten out of ten establishment!

370
00:26:57,681 --> 00:27:02,241
Thank you, thank you, please vote ten out of ten for KFP, and come back, okay?

371
00:27:02,811 --> 00:27:04,341
And actually, you know what, that's not a choice anyway.

372
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:08,181
Hi, Callie! "Studio Movie Grill"? What?

373
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:10,611
What does that mean?

374
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:15,611
Anyway... Callie! Callie!

375
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:23,311
Speaking of Callie, I think I'm gonna maybe need to talk to her personally, and actually all of the Myth members.

376
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:25,941
Shall we talk to them? Yay!

377
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:31,011
Moshi moshi! Purupurupurupuru...

378
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:33,281
Gachan!

379
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:34,281
Hi!

380
00:27:34,281 --> 00:27:35,411
Hey!

381
00:27:34,311 --> 00:27:35,311
Hello!

382
00:27:35,411 --> 00:27:38,641
O-denwa... Oh, I missed the chance!

383
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:39,981
Kiara!

384
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:41,911
I was gonna pull the voicemail prank.

385
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:46,141
Whu-? No! No voicemail! No!

386
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:46,081
You're really here right now, right?

387
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:47,411
Hi!

388
00:27:47,411 --> 00:27:48,941
I'm for real.

389
00:27:48,981 --> 00:27:49,881
For real!

390
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:50,881
For real!

391
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:53,141
Congratulations, Kiwawa!

392
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:54,711
Thank you!

393
00:27:54,711 --> 00:27:57,141
Really quickly, let's do introduction here.

394
00:27:57,181 --> 00:27:57,981
This one is?

395
00:27:57,981 --> 00:27:58,781
Amelia!

396
00:27:58,781 --> 00:27:59,681
And this one is?

397
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:00,981
Ina'nis!

398
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:01,281
Wah!

399
00:28:00,981 --> 00:28:01,881
And this one is?

400
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:03,281
Gura!

401
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,281
Gubugubugubugubu...

402
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,211
And this one is?

403
00:28:04,211 --> 00:28:05,541
Ina'nis!

404
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:05,681
Hum hum hum...

405
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:06,581
And this one is?

406
00:28:06,581 --> 00:28:07,511
Mori!

407
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:09,181
Exactly!

408
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:15,441
Kiwawa! Hi! I love you!

409
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:19,411
Out of these ones, this one, this Tako, already had her reveal.

410
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:22,381
The rest are to come!

411
00:28:20,181 --> 00:28:22,381
I did! I'm free!

412
00:28:24,511 --> 00:28:29,211
I'm really nervous right now, but you girls being here helps me a little bit.

413
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:32,041
Hehe! Have fun! It only happens once!

414
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,281
It does only happen once, yeah.

415
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:37,111
Finally! You are amazing so far, Kiara!

416
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:41,441
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

417
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:44,281
Well, um, there's actually a hashtag up there, right?

418
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:51,381
#Kiara3DParty! And with that, if you guys were wondering what should we tweet...

419
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:56,341
Well, how about some screenshots? And I'm gonna give you guys...

420
00:28:55,311 --> 00:28:56,641
I already posted some!

421
00:28:56,711 --> 00:28:59,881
Wait, you mean the hashtag is #Kiara3DParty?

422
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:02,241
Yes! You got it right!

423
00:29:02,411 --> 00:29:06,211
Yes, yes, that's it, that's it, that's exactly it!

424
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,941
I should type it into Twitter sixty times to make sure it's right.

425
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:10,811
That's it, that's exactly it, yeah, you got it right! You heard exactly.

426
00:29:11,211 --> 00:29:15,611
But in order to take some great screenshots, I think we need your help, my dear Myth members.

427
00:29:18,611 --> 00:29:22,581
So, are you ready to, you know, do some stuff with me?

428
00:29:22,611 --> 00:29:23,611
I've been waiting!

429
00:29:23,781 --> 00:29:24,781
Ready, Kiara!

430
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:27,541
Okay, let's start with Ame! Ametori!

431
00:29:28,241 --> 00:29:32,411
Kiara-Kiara... can I get a... Kiara-Kiara... can I get a...

432
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:38,281
Can I get the Smart Burger set and the large fries and...

433
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:41,641
No! No! Not now!

434
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:45,141
You gotta get it yourself! If you want some food, you gotta go yourself!

435
00:29:45,181 --> 00:29:48,411
Oh, I can go back there? I have permission?

436
00:29:48,511 --> 00:29:51,041
Hmm... yeah, if it's you, okay!

437
00:29:51,381 --> 00:29:56,611
Okay, my- my pose is the... the fetal position.

438
00:29:57,141 --> 00:29:58,411
Fetal?

439
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:03,293
Did I hear correctly? Fetal position?

440
00:30:03,293 --> 00:30:05,193
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

441
00:30:05,193 --> 00:30:07,893
You want me to become baboo baboo baboo...

442
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:08,593
...feet?

443
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:09,693
Baboo Kiara!

444
00:30:09,693 --> 00:30:11,793
Wait, is it fetal or feet-us?

445
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:14,093
I said it's like a baby, right?

446
00:30:14,093 --> 00:30:15,593
Is that what you meant?

447
00:30:15,593 --> 00:30:20,593
Baboo baboo baboo baboo baboo...

448
00:30:20,593 --> 00:30:23,093
That's just, that's just taking a nap.

449
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:24,793
Wait, that's not a fetal position.

450
00:30:24,793 --> 00:30:27,193
I guess it's more like... more closer?

451
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:28,493
That's close enough.

452
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,993
Like rocking back and forth, like having an existential crisis.

453
00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:33,293
Oh, it's also, you also get the snail.

454
00:30:33,293 --> 00:30:34,593
It's a snail!

455
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:35,393
Snail!

456
00:30:35,393 --> 00:30:36,993
We can redo it as snail!

457
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:37,893
Yeah, snail!

458
00:30:37,893 --> 00:30:39,193
Snail! I do!

459
00:30:39,193 --> 00:30:41,093
And snail!

460
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:46,093
Oh... oh... Oh, look at her!

461
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:48,093
Yeah! NG, NG!

462
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:49,193
I think that's it.

463
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:52,593
Oh, you know the Chikens want that. Just kidding.

464
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:55,793
I think Ame has too crazy ideas.

465
00:30:55,793 --> 00:30:59,093
Gura, can you give me something that's more safe for Twitter, please?

466
00:30:59,093 --> 00:31:00,693
Yo. Okay.

467
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:03,093
I would like you to...

468
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:07,893
give me a pose that would entice me to buy all of the chicken in your establishment.

469
00:31:07,893 --> 00:31:08,893
Entice you?

470
00:31:08,893 --> 00:31:12,093
Ooh, entice you to buy all of the chicken.

471
00:31:12,093 --> 00:31:14,293
Oh, okay. I guess it's not that kind of chicken.

472
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:19,493
Okay, okay, let's bring out the chicken! Tada!

473
00:31:19,493 --> 00:31:23,093
Ooh, yum yums! All right, all right.

474
00:31:23,093 --> 00:31:25,593
Entice you... Entice you...

475
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:29,093
Ooh, mmm... yum yum yum...

476
00:31:29,093 --> 00:31:31,593
Mmm, this looks so delicious.

477
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:33,293
Mmm, yum yum yum yum yum.

478
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:34,593
Come closer.

479
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:36,093
How is that?

480
00:31:36,093 --> 00:31:38,293
Doesn't it smell nice?

481
00:31:38,293 --> 00:31:42,093
Just for you, fresh chicken straight out of the kitchen.

482
00:31:42,093 --> 00:31:44,293
Mmm. Mwah.

483
00:31:44,293 --> 00:31:46,093
Maybe I should stand here.

484
00:31:46,093 --> 00:31:49,093
On the Phoenix! Yum yum yum yum yum.

485
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:50,193
Beautiful.

486
00:31:50,193 --> 00:31:51,593
How's that? Is that enticing?

487
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:53,193
You feel like buying some?

488
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:54,493
I'm drooling.

489
00:31:54,493 --> 00:31:55,793
I'm just, I've just thought about it.

490
00:31:55,793 --> 00:31:57,193
How about the bucket?

491
00:31:57,193 --> 00:31:58,293
I've come broke.

492
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:00,693
Okay, I'll throw in the bucket too. Throw in the bucket!

493
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:02,193
Bucket, bucket! Throw in the bucket!

494
00:32:02,193 --> 00:32:05,493
Shall we throw in the family pack? Let's throw it all in.

495
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:07,293
The family pack! Cute!

496
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:08,593
I'll take two.

497
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,793
Two? Ooh, but there's like... there's like 12 pieces in there.

498
00:32:12,793 --> 00:32:14,393
Can I get the combo?

499
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:18,093
The combo! Co-co-co-combo! Yes, number 9, please.

500
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:22,093
You can have everything for free today! It's on me!

501
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:24,493
The extra bucket! For free! For free!

502
00:32:24,493 --> 00:32:26,593
Free? What a deal!

503
00:32:26,593 --> 00:32:28,193
What a deal!

504
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:30,493
Oh, speaking of Ina.

505
00:32:30,493 --> 00:32:33,293
Ina, what do you want from me?

506
00:32:33,293 --> 00:32:38,093
Oh, hmm... what do I want? What do I want?

507
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:40,493
Is it possible to maybe...

508
00:32:40,493 --> 00:32:44,293
unleash the special thing on your belt to...

509
00:32:44,293 --> 00:32:47,393
you know, maybe perhaps take out your weapon?

510
00:32:47,393 --> 00:32:51,593
Okay! Let me just drink some water real quick.

511
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:53,093
We've got violence here.

512
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:54,193
Let's go violence.

513
00:32:54,193 --> 00:32:55,293
What's she doing?

514
00:32:55,293 --> 00:32:56,593
Ah, hitting the griddy.

515
00:32:56,593 --> 00:32:59,093
I'll go get my sword and my shield!

516
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:01,093
We got biscuits here. Stab me!

517
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:04,093
Tada! Sword and shield! Some biscuits!

518
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:06,093
Whoa! Powerful!

519
00:33:06,093 --> 00:33:08,193
Hyah! Hyah!

520
00:33:08,193 --> 00:33:10,293
Okay, watch out for the camera!

521
00:33:10,293 --> 00:33:11,793
Oh, cute! This is a familiar scene.

522
00:33:11,793 --> 00:33:13,593
We saw it already today.

523
00:33:13,593 --> 00:33:18,493
Hyah! Hyah! Cute!

524
00:33:18,493 --> 00:33:20,593
Oh no! All right, Kiara.

525
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:22,093
She's so feisty.

526
00:33:22,093 --> 00:33:26,593
Now I want you to take your sword and lick it.

527
00:33:26,593 --> 00:33:30,593
Huh? No, actually... okay.

528
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:34,093
Licking is okay too, but I'll one-up you.

529
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:37,093
How about, you know, the sword-eating thing?

530
00:33:37,093 --> 00:33:40,593
Surely I can do that! Do it, do it!

531
00:33:40,593 --> 00:33:45,193
A trick! Yeah, let's go! She totally ate it!

532
00:33:45,193 --> 00:33:48,093
Whoa! Let's go! For the clout!

533
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,293
For the clout! Ollie, is that you?

534
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,593
Oh my god! I thought I saw Ollie for a second.

535
00:33:51,593 --> 00:33:54,093
Must have been my imagination.

536
00:33:54,093 --> 00:33:58,293
Never mind. You know, I think that was already too...

537
00:33:58,293 --> 00:34:01,393
...like, you know, the camera that went down my throat yesterday.

538
00:34:01,393 --> 00:34:02,593
That's enough.

539
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:04,693
It's a bit sensitive right now, okay?

540
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:09,193
But for serious, for real, for real.

541
00:34:09,193 --> 00:34:12,793
I would like you to make the letters K, F, and P...

542
00:34:12,793 --> 00:34:18,493
...using a way with my stuff. Okay.

543
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:21,093
K-F-P? Yeah.

544
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:23,193
Okay. K...

545
00:34:23,193 --> 00:34:27,293
K! Ah, wrong side.

546
00:34:27,293 --> 00:34:30,993
K! F! and P!

547
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:34,093
Okay, I'll take it.

548
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:38,293
There it is! Okay, last but not least.

549
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:40,693
Calli, what do you got?

550
00:34:40,693 --> 00:34:46,093
Yeah, I want to order some chicken, some chicken legs.

551
00:34:46,093 --> 00:34:49,093
Um, I want to see those chicken legs...

552
00:34:49,093 --> 00:34:54,893
...trying to balance in the cutest idle pose that you can for the longest time.

553
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:57,093
Balance? So one leg up?

554
00:34:57,093 --> 00:34:58,593
One leg. Okay, on one chicken leg.

555
00:34:58,593 --> 00:35:00,093
Here we go!

556
00:35:00,905 --> 00:35:01,405
Ready, go!

557
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:03,505
Let's go. So, we gotta talk about something...

558
00:35:03,605 --> 00:35:04,605
Kiara, idol pose!

559
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:05,905
There we go!

560
00:35:05,905 --> 00:35:07,205
Can I do it while doing this?

561
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:07,905
Sure thing. Sure thing.

562
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,605
Have you ever been to Medieval Times before?

563
00:35:10,905 --> 00:35:12,205
Medieval Times?

564
00:35:12,205 --> 00:35:12,705
Yes!

565
00:35:12,705 --> 00:35:13,605
Why do you ask that?

566
00:35:13,705 --> 00:35:17,605
Yeah, that's what I was thinking when you said "dinner and a show" besides Studio Movie Grill. Yeah.

567
00:35:18,105 --> 00:35:20,605
Wait, you don't mean the medieval times...

568
00:35:20,605 --> 00:35:22,605
...like many thousand years ago?

569
00:35:22,805 --> 00:35:24,505
You mean like there's a place like that?

570
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:26,605
No, there's a place called Medieval...

571
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:28,105
Oh, of course you've been to the Medieval...

572
00:35:28,205 --> 00:35:30,105
No, we mean the medieval times, right? Yeah, yeah.

573
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:32,005
Hey, I can do this forever, Calli!

574
00:35:32,105 --> 00:35:33,505
Oh my god. Well, stick your...

575
00:35:33,505 --> 00:35:35,505
Okay, you need to put your other foot up higher.

576
00:35:35,605 --> 00:35:36,205
Higher?

577
00:35:36,305 --> 00:35:37,405
It's too close to the ground.

578
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:38,305
Higher!

579
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:39,205
Pull it up, pull it up.

580
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:40,005
Yes, pull it up.

581
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,005
It's higher! It's cuter!

582
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,605
I gotta do this with one foot...

583
00:35:43,105 --> 00:35:44,305
Higher, higher, higher!

584
00:35:44,405 --> 00:35:46,105
Higher, higher, higher!

585
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:49,105
Higher, higher, higher!

586
00:35:50,105 --> 00:35:53,105
Higher, higher, higher! You're on fire!

587
00:35:54,105 --> 00:35:56,605
Let's go! Yeah, let's go!

588
00:35:56,705 --> 00:35:58,605
Can she stay on one foot?

589
00:35:58,605 --> 00:36:00,105
Ladies and gentlemen, let's find out!

590
00:36:00,205 --> 00:36:01,305
I can!

591
00:36:02,405 --> 00:36:04,305
Oh yeah, really good balance.

592
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:06,105
さすがアイドル！
As expected of an idol!

593
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:07,205
Incredible.

594
00:36:07,305 --> 00:36:09,205
Alright, alright. She's too good at this.

595
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:11,605
Okay, you want to go ahead and do the chicken dance real quick?

596
00:36:11,705 --> 00:36:13,105
Chicken dance! Okay.

597
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:20,605
Ta-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da, ta-da!

598
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:22,605
No DMCA. No DMCA.

599
00:36:22,705 --> 00:36:24,605
Oh, is that maybe free? Who knows?

600
00:36:24,705 --> 00:36:25,605
I don't know, maybe.

601
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:28,105
We just... we just have to add in "HoloLive" in the middle.

602
00:36:28,205 --> 00:36:30,305
Ta-da-da-da HoloLive!

603
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:32,505
Ta-da-da-da HoloLive!

604
00:36:33,305 --> 00:36:34,605
Let's not risk it.

605
00:36:34,705 --> 00:36:35,705
It's pretty good though.

606
00:36:37,105 --> 00:36:39,605
I really don't know how that one works though.

607
00:36:39,705 --> 00:36:42,605
I don't know. You do something... it's not just this.

608
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:45,105
Yeah, you like turn, you like do the hokey pokey...

609
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:48,105
...and you shake it all about, or something like that.

610
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:52,605
I hope that was enough for the screenshot game.

611
00:36:52,705 --> 00:36:54,705
Hope you guys got some good ones. Did you?

612
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:56,605
I forgot.

613
00:36:56,705 --> 00:36:57,405
You forgot?

614
00:36:57,505 --> 00:37:01,105
I was too happy watching you, you know?
I took them with my eyes.

615
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:04,105
Don't worry, there will be more opportunities.

616
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,605
I'm sure chat took some. Or like a thousand. Two thousand.

617
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:11,305
You better put them on the internet #Kiara3DParty.

618
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:14,105
You mean #Kiara3DParty?

619
00:37:14,205 --> 00:37:16,605
Is that what you said? #Kiara3DParty?

620
00:37:16,705 --> 00:37:18,605
Yeah, that's exactly what I said.

621
00:37:18,705 --> 00:37:22,305
I'm typing it into Google to check it... once, fifty times.

622
00:37:24,105 --> 00:37:26,605
Is it correct? #Kiara3DParty?

623
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:28,105
That's it, that's it! Kiara 3D Party!

624
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:29,605
Sounds right to me.

625
00:37:30,205 --> 00:37:33,505
Thank you so much for coming, girls!

626
00:37:33,605 --> 00:37:37,105
No problem! Have fun!

627
00:37:46,105 --> 00:37:47,605
Alright.

628
00:37:47,705 --> 00:37:54,105
Okay, so wow... there is still more to come though.

629
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:57,605
Because these were my gen mates, right?

630
00:37:58,305 --> 00:38:02,605
But I feel like I need something that's not cardboard.

631
00:38:03,105 --> 00:38:07,905
How about we bring in some 3D guests!

632
00:38:09,105 --> 00:38:12,605
Alright, but for that we have to change location!

633
00:38:12,705 --> 00:38:14,605
Let's change! Whoo!

634
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:22,105
The Usual Room

635
00:39:47,105 --> 00:39:54,105
友達は友達なんだ！
Lyrics: つんく / Composer: つんく
Friends Are Just Friends!
Lyrics: Tsunku / Composer: Tsunku

636
00:39:56,105 --> 00:40:01,105
ねえ　友情って
古くなって　いいんだよ　My friend
Hey, it's okay
for friendship to grow old, my friend

637
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:04,617
そんなの続かないから Oh, my friend
That won't last, so oh my friend

638
00:40:05,217 --> 00:40:09,217
自慢の彼をみんなに一度会わせたら
Once you introduce your proud boyfriend to everyone

639
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:13,217
あとは彼に尽くしなよ
After that, just devote yourself to him

640
00:40:14,617 --> 00:40:18,617
お家事情はみんなとつるんで楽しい
Home life is fun hanging out with everyone

641
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,917
朝まで友情語り合ったりした
Talking about friendship until morning

642
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:28,117
でも一人二人と彼氏ができ始めたら
But when one or two start getting boyfriends

643
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:30,617
彼氏優先！
Boyfriends come first!

644
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:37,417
友達は友達なんだ
Friends are friends

645
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:41,617
気を使うくらい距離のある友なら意味ないよ
Friends you have to be careful around are meaningless

646
00:40:42,617 --> 00:40:46,617
またそのうち語り合おうぞ
Let's talk again sometime

647
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:50,917
そのうちにはワイワイとみんなで会えるだろう
Sometime soon, we'll all be able to meet and have fun

648
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,117
気なんか使わない
I won't be careful

649
00:40:56,417 --> 00:41:00,117
このままでいたいな
I want to stay like this

650
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:13,917
告られそうになりゃすぐに教えなよ Oh my friend
If you think someone's gonna confess, tell me right away Oh my friend

651
00:41:14,217 --> 00:41:18,217
愚痴くらい聞いてあげるよ Oh my friend
I'll at least listen to your complaints Oh my friend

652
00:41:18,617 --> 00:41:22,617
でも中途半端にしゃしゃり出ないよ
But I won't interfere half-heartedly

653
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:26,617
もっと複雑になるし
It'll just get more complicated

654
00:41:28,117 --> 00:41:32,117
もし終わった恋バナみんなでキチンと料理
If a romance ends, let's process it properly together

655
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:36,417
うまい笑い話に変えてあげるさ
And turn it into a good funny story

656
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:41,117
そのうちいつも以上にノリを掴みができるはずさ
Sometime soon, we should be able to get into the groove even more

657
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:50,617
友達は友達なんだ
Friends are friends

658
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:54,917
どんな時も元の位置に戻れる
We can return to our original positions anytime

659
00:41:55,217 --> 00:41:56,617
それが友
That's what friends are

660
00:41:57,117 --> 00:42:00,617
とは言え年一度くらい
Having said that, maybe about once a year

661
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:04,917
昼でもいいランチして情報交換したいな
Let's have lunch, even during the day, and exchange info

662
00:42:07,617 --> 00:42:10,617
ドタキャンもありで
Last-minute cancellations are okay too

663
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:14,617
このままでいたいな
I want to stay like this

664
00:42:35,417 --> 00:42:39,417

I want to stay like this

673
00:43:30,917 --> 00:43:32,517
よっしゃー！
All right!

674
00:43:32,617 --> 00:43:33,517
キアラ！
Kiara!

675
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:38,317
セレブレート！セレブレート！
Celebrate! Celebrate!

676
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:41,617
スバル様、落ち着け、落ち着け。
Subaru-sama, calm down, calm down.

677
00:43:41,717 --> 00:43:42,917
落ち着くんだ。
Calm down.

678
00:43:43,017 --> 00:43:43,717

Hey, but, how would you describe Kiara's body?

715
00:44:44,317 --> 00:44:47,617
うーん...
Hmm...

716
00:44:48,617 --> 00:44:50,117
例えると、
If I were to describe it,

717
00:44:50,217 --> 00:44:52,617
Kiara body is like fruit!

718
00:44:52,717 --> 00:44:53,917
Beautiful fruit!

違う、違う、違う。
Wait, wait, wait.

00:45:06,762 --> 00:45:08,262
え？ペア、ペアかな？ペア。
Huh? A pear, maybe? A pear.

00:45:18,295 --> 00:45:19,595
I want to do something.

735
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:20,629
Okay!

736
00:45:20,629 --> 00:45:22,629
あ、でも逆、逆、逆。
Ah, but reverse, reverse, reverse.

737
00:45:22,629 --> 00:45:24,595
So, you probably have seen it before.

738
00:45:24,595 --> 00:45:26,695
The famous Suba-dance!

739
00:45:26,695 --> 00:45:28,129

00:45:29,462 --> 00:45:30,329
Okay!

00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:32,529
So, "Hey Ya"っていう曲、今流せないけど。
So, the song "Hey Ya", we can't play it right now,

743
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:33,995
We can't play the song.

744
00:45:33,995 --> 00:45:35,062
But!

745
00:45:35,062 --> 00:45:37,162
I want to do it, and then you guys put it together, please.

746
00:45:37,162 --> 00:45:39,229
You could just put the song on there, alright? Okay.

747
00:45:39,229 --> 00:45:40,529
Okay, let's go! Suba-dance!

748
00:45:41,495 --> 00:45:42,629
はい、せーの！
Alright, here we go!

749
00:45:42,629 --> 00:45:47,495
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6!

750
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:50,129
チャン、チャン、チャン、チャン、チャン、チャン！

チャン、チャン、チャン、チャン、チャン、チャン！
Chan, chan, chan, chan, chan, chan!

753
00:45:57,795 --> 00:45:58,962
1, 2... 違う、逆だ！
1, 2... wait, it's backwards!

754
00:45:58,962 --> 00:46:00,795
逆だ！いつも逆だ！
It's backwards! It's always backwards!

755
00:46:00,795 --> 00:46:02,962
でも間に1回できたから、OKかな？
But we got it right once in the middle, so it's fine?

756
00:46:02,962 --> 00:46:04,095
Alright!

757
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,895
イェーイ！しゅばだ！
Yay! Suba-dance!

758
00:46:05,895 --> 00:46:08,695
いいね、いいね。いいでしょう。
Nice, nice. Looking good.

759
00:46:08,695 --> 00:46:13,429
あの曲、いっぱい聴いてほしい。スバル先輩にも一回歌ってほしい。
I want people to listen to that song a lot.
I want to sing it with Subaru-senpai once.

760
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:15,695
しゅばだ？しゅばダンスの歌？
Suba-dance? The Suba-dance song?

761
00:46:15,695 --> 00:46:16,595
Hey Ya?

762
00:46:16,595 --> 00:46:17,429
そう。
Yeah.

763
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:18,562
OK、あの…

00:46:19,595 --> 00:46:23,195
Next time, you must send my Discord.
Next time, you must send to my Discord.

766
00:46:23,195 --> 00:46:24,529
OK, OK! I will send.

767
00:46:24,529 --> 00:46:26,629
I will send after this, after.

768
00:46:26,629 --> 00:46:28,295
OK, but after this...

769
00:46:28,295 --> 00:46:30,495
After this...

770
00:46:30,495 --> 00:46:34,595
実は、この後もゲストがいる！
Actually, there's another guest after this too!

771
00:46:34,595 --> 00:46:36,562
おー、バッ！
Oh, but!

772
00:46:36,562 --> 00:46:37,795
キアラ！
Kiara!

773
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,395
うん。
Yeah.

774
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:39,995
I have a question.

775
00:46:39,995 --> 00:46:41,329
お、何何何？
Oh, what is it?

776
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:42,629
Why this song?

777
00:46:42,629 --> 00:46:45,462
Why do you choose this song?
Why did you choose this song?

778
00:46:45,462 --> 00:46:47,029
あ、そっか！
Oh, right!

779
00:46:47,029 --> 00:46:48,462
Yes, I forgot!

780
00:46:48,462 --> 00:46:50,262
忘れてた。ごめん、あーまち。
I forgot, sorry. Oh wait.

781
00:46:50,262 --> 00:46:52,629
もう、先輩頼れる！
Man, senpai is so reliable!

782
00:46:52,629 --> 00:46:54,762
Thank you, senpai.

783
00:46:54,762 --> 00:46:57,229
まあ、そのソング、この曲…
Well, that song, this song...

784
00:46:57,229 --> 00:46:58,629
そのソング？そのソング？
"Sono song"? "Sono song"?

785
00:46:58,629 --> 00:47:00,195
まあ、友達は友達なんだ。
Well, friends are friends.

786
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:01,429
そう！
Yeah!

787
00:47:01,429 --> 00:47:02,229
Why?

788
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:05,262
It's a song from my favorite idol group,

789
00:47:05,262 --> 00:47:07,562
Berryz工房。私、ベリヲタなんで。
Berryz Kobo. I'm a "Berry-ota" (Berryz fan).

790
00:47:07,562 --> 00:47:08,895
そう。
Yeah.

791
00:47:08,895 --> 00:47:11,962
で、一緒に歌ってくれてありがとう。
So, thank you for singing it with me.

792
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:13,395
ベリヲタ、ベリヲタ。
Berry-ota, Berry-ota.

793
00:47:13,395 --> 00:47:15,995
ベリヲタとして、めっちゃ嬉しかった！
As a Berry-ota, I'm so happy!

794
00:47:16,995 --> 00:47:21,195
You are... because you are otaku.

795
00:47:21,195 --> 00:47:23,195
Yes, yes, yes!

796
00:47:23,195 --> 00:47:24,829
そういうことなの？
Is that how it is?

797
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:27,362
ね、まあ、あと歌詞も、めちゃくちゃ合うなと思ったし。
Well, also the lyrics, I thought they really fit us.

798
00:47:27,362 --> 00:47:29,795
Yeah.

799
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:32,529
あと、曲のなんか元気さもスバル先輩には合うかなと思ったから、
And also, the energy of the song,
I thought it would suit Subaru-senpai well,

800
00:47:32,529 --> 00:47:35,062
この曲選んだんです。
that's why I chose this song.

801
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:37,529
Powerful song!

802
00:47:37,529 --> 00:47:38,362
Yeah!

803
00:47:38,362 --> 00:47:39,929
元気ソング！
Energy song!

804
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:41,495
おおー！サンキュー！
Ohh! Thank you!

805
00:47:41,495 --> 00:47:43,195
Thank you too!

806
00:47:43,195 --> 00:47:47,462
じゃあ、友達だから友達っぽく帰りますか？
Well, we're friends, so shall we go back like friends?

807
00:47:47,462 --> 00:47:48,529
ハハハ！
Hahaha!

808
00:47:48,529 --> 00:47:51,429
今まで友達じゃないみたい… We are friends!
It's like we weren't friends until now... We are friends!

809
00:47:51,429 --> 00:47:52,562
Okay!

810
00:47:52,562 --> 00:47:54,729
ホロバード！ホロバード！
Holo-bird! Holo-bird!

811
00:47:54,729 --> 00:47:56,662
ホロバード！
Holo-bird!

812
00:47:56,662 --> 00:47:57,729
Okay!

813
00:47:57,729 --> 00:47:59,862
じゃあ、別のとこに行くから。移動！
Well, we're going somewhere else now. Let's go!

814
00:47:59,862 --> 00:48:00,762
Let's go!

815
00:48:00,762 --> 00:48:04,129
Let's go!!!

816
00:49:11,362 --> 00:49:13,362
流れ星...
A shooting star...

817
00:49:13,362 --> 00:49:26,629
La la la...

818
00:49:29,062 --> 00:49:33,829
流れ星 願い事込めれば君に伝わるの
A shooting star, if I put a wish in it, will it reach you?

819
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:39,295
この街は孤独なほど景色に溶け込んでく
This city melts into the scenery as it becomes lonelier

820
00:49:39,662 --> 00:49:44,329
涙星 頬に流れてる 私の涙よ
Tear stars, they're flowing down my cheeks, these are my tears

821
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:49,595
悔しくて泣くんじゃない 生きてる証なんだよ
I'm not crying out of frustration, it's proof that I'm alive

822
00:49:50,129 --> 00:49:55,329
胸を癒すような このメロディ
This melody that seems to heal my heart

823
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:57,395
ひとり...
Alone...

824
00:49:57,395 --> 00:49:58,662
だけど...
But...

825
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,729
なぜか...
For some reason...

826
00:49:59,729 --> 00:50:00,129
ひとり...
Alone...

827
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:03,241
…じゃないような気分になれる
...I can feel like I'm not...

828
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:09,741
悲しきヘブン 心が乾くけど
Sad Heaven, though my heart is dry

829
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,741
たった一つ 夢があるだけで
Just having one dream

830
00:50:13,741 --> 00:50:15,641
私はそれで十分
is enough for me

831
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:20,441
セブンス・ヘブン いつかはたどりつく
Seventh Heaven, I'll reach it someday

832
00:50:21,641 --> 00:50:24,441
この果てなき 空を行けば
Travelling through this endless sky

833
00:50:24,741 --> 00:50:27,641
迷うこともあるだろう
I might get lost sometimes

834
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:45,841
流れ星 都会じゃ見えない
Shooting stars, unseen in the city

835
00:50:45,841 --> 00:50:47,941
現実の中で
within this reality

836
00:50:48,941 --> 00:50:51,441
今夜だけ 一人じゃない
Just for tonight, I feel like

837
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:53,441
そんな感じがしてる
I'm not alone

838
00:50:54,241 --> 00:50:56,641
ため息で 言葉にならない
There are moments when sighs

839
00:50:56,641 --> 00:50:58,641
瞬間もあるが
take the place of words

840
00:50:59,441 --> 00:51:02,241
寂しくて 震えていた
I feel nostalgic for those days when

841
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:04,341
あの頃が懐かしいな
I was lonely and trembling

842
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:08,441
そうさ 過去なんて どうでもいい
That's right, the past doesn't matter

843
00:51:10,141 --> 00:51:12,841
明日になれば きっと
When tomorrow comes, surely...

844
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:18,541
まぶしい光 この手に入る
...dazzling light will be in my hands

845
00:51:21,141 --> 00:51:24,541
悲しきヘブン 傷んだ翼でも
Sad Heaven, even with damaged wings

846
00:51:26,241 --> 00:51:28,241
それが叶うことを 信じなきゃ
It's meaningless if I don't believe

847
00:51:28,241 --> 00:51:29,941
意味がない
it will come true

848
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:35,041
セブンス・ヘブン 碧いこの星から
Seventh Heaven, from this blue planet

849
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:39,041
遠きゴール 目指すだけさ
Just aiming for a distant goal

850
00:51:39,241 --> 00:51:42,641
好きなことなら続く
I'll keep going if it's something I love

851
00:52:00,941 --> 00:52:04,441
悲しきヘブン 心が乾くけど
Sad Heaven, though my heart is dry

852
00:52:06,241 --> 00:52:08,441
たった一つ 夢があるだけで
Just having one dream

853
00:52:08,441 --> 00:52:10,141
私はそれで十分
is enough for me

854
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:14,741
セブンス・ヘブン いつかはたどりつく
Seventh Heaven, I'll reach it someday

855
00:52:16,241 --> 00:52:19,041
この果てなき 空を行けば
Travelling through this endless sky

856
00:52:19,241 --> 00:52:22,141
迷うこともあるだろう
I might get lost sometimes

857
00:52:37,841 --> 00:52:42,441
流れ星 願いを込めれば 君に伝わるの
If I wish upon a shooting star, will it reach you?

858
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:46,541
この街は 孤独だけど
This city is lonely, but it's the city

859
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:51,441
君と出会えた街だから
where I met you

860
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:07,641
（歓声と拍手）
(Cheering and applause)

861
00:53:08,941 --> 00:53:10,341
キキキ！
Ki-ki-ki!

862
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:14,141
こんねね！こんねね！
Kon-nene! Kon-nene!

863
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,641
二人目のゲスト、ねねち！
My second guest, Nene-chi!

864
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:20,641
桃鈴ねねでーす！
I'm Momosuzu Nene!

865
00:53:21,441 --> 00:53:22,641
踊ったな！
We danced!

866
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,141
できたね！
We did it!

867
00:53:24,441 --> 00:53:27,641
いいよ！かっこいい！
Nice! So cool!

868
00:53:27,741 --> 00:53:29,641
かっこいいでしょ！
We're cool, right?

869
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:32,441
英語自己紹介できる？
Can you introduce yourself in English?

870
00:53:32,841 --> 00:53:34,941
ホロライブ五期生、
Hololive Fifth Generation,

871
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:41,641
ねね、桃鈴ねね！イェーイ！
Nene, Momosuzu Nene! Yay!

872
00:53:42,641 --> 00:53:45,641
うちの自己紹介もいらないよね。
I don't need to introduce myself, right?

873
00:53:46,441 --> 00:53:50,141
So actually, you guys probably know,

874
00:53:50,241 --> 00:53:55,441
together, people call us a name, which is "Orenzu".

875
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:57,441
「おれんず」って呼ばれてるね、うちら。
We're called "Orenzu", right?

876
00:53:57,541 --> 00:53:59,141
呼ばれてる。
We are.

877
00:53:59,241 --> 00:54:00,641
呼ばれてるっていうか…
Well, "called" or...

878
00:54:00,741 --> 00:54:04,441
うちらが先に名乗り出したから。
because we started calling ourselves that first.

879
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:05,641
そう、名乗り出したから。
Yeah, because we named ourselves.

880
00:54:05,741 --> 00:54:08,641
So thank you for calling us "Orenzu".

881
00:54:08,741 --> 00:54:12,441
I knew that if I had to call a guest for my show,

882
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:18,541
ゲスト呼ぶんだったら、うちの中で絶対的にねねち呼ぶしかないと思ってた。
I thought it absolutely had to be Nene-chi.

883
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:20,641
I had to call you!

884
00:54:21,141 --> 00:54:22,641
嬉しい！
I'm so happy!

885
00:54:23,141 --> 00:54:28,241
So this is basically the first time that Orenzu is dancing together in 3D.

886
00:54:28,341 --> 00:54:29,641
初めてだね。
It's the first time.

887
00:54:29,741 --> 00:54:31,141
初めて。
First time.

888
00:54:31,241 --> 00:54:35,141
かわいいよ、キアラちゃん！かわいいよ！
You're so cute, Kiara-chan! So cute!

889
00:54:35,241 --> 00:54:38,641
ねねちの方がかわいい！
Nene-chi is cuter!

890
00:54:38,741 --> 00:54:40,141
あ、やだやだやだ！
Oh, stop it!

891
00:54:40,241 --> 00:54:44,141
ま、ということで、初めての「おれんず」ということで…
So, since it's the first Orenzu collab...

892
00:54:44,441 --> 00:54:48,141
やっぱりお互いどっちもアイドル大好きでしょ？
We both love idols, right?

893
00:54:48,441 --> 00:54:52,641
I love idols. You love idols. We are idols.

894
00:54:52,841 --> 00:54:59,141
So I want to create some kind of idol-poi greeting, 挨拶作りたい。
So I want to create some kind of idol-like greeting.

895
00:55:00,278 --> 00:55:01,478

00:55:08,728 --> 00:55:11,903
まぁオレンジデイズということで、どうする？
Well, since we're Orange Days, what should we do?

900
00:55:11,903 --> 00:55:15,678
うーん、なんかテーマみたいな。オレンジのテーマ。
Umm, like a theme. An orange theme.

おぉ、いいね！世界を...
Oh, nice! The world...

906
00:55:33,403 --> 00:55:36,678
オレンジ色に染め上げるとか、染めていくとかどう？

907
00:55:36,678 --> 00:55:40,603
おんじゃ、染めちゃうにしよう。染めちゃうで。オケ、オケ。
Then, let's go with "sometchau". "Sometchau" it is. Okay, okay.

ダンスの先生がね、早く覚えてと。ね、褒めてくれたんだ。すごい。
The dance teacher said we learned it quickly and... Right, she praised us. Amazing.

929
00:57:22,678 --> 00:57:27,603
すごい早いって言われたよね。ね。うちもねっちとのダンス練習は楽だろうなと思って楽しみにした。
She said we were really fast, didn't she? I thought dance practice with Necchi would be easy and was looking forward to it.

930
00:57:27,603 --> 00:57:35,678
え、本当？ね、うちもすごい楽しみにした。でもちょっと朝だったから...
Eh, really? Yeah, I was looking forward to it too. But it was a bit early in the morning, so...

Because it's fast. Bam. I wonder if I'm doing it right? Ah, no. It's fast, you see. Yeah, if you do it slowly you can do it really beautifully.

夜、夜の6時です。
In the evening, 6 PM.

962
01:00:27,365 --> 01:00:30,165
Well, and of course tomorrow...

963
01:00:30,165 --> 01:00:34,365
...is also the 3D debut of Calliope Mori.

964
01:00:34,365 --> 01:00:36,665
So go check her out, okay?

So, besides that...

967
01:00:40,965 --> 01:00:43,465
...I have one more song for you guys.

968
01:00:43,465 --> 01:00:46,465
But we— I think we should change location.

969
01:00:46,465 --> 01:00:48,165
Is that okay?

970
01:00:48,165 --> 01:00:49,665
Change! Change!

971
01:00:49,665 --> 01:00:53,165
Alright, there's one more stage I haven't shown you guys yet...

972
01:00:53,165 --> 01:00:56,665
...which is the big Hololive English stage!

973
01:00:56,665 --> 01:00:58,665
Let's go!

974
01:02:26,665 --> 01:02:28,665
Ah, ah... That video!

975
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:30,965
I did not give the permission to show that video!

976
01:02:30,965 --> 01:02:33,365
Why did you show that video?! Ahh!

977
01:02:33,365 --> 01:02:35,665
I wasn't slacking, I was practicing!

978
01:02:35,665 --> 01:02:40,465
Well, I am here on this beautiful EN stage right now...

979
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:43,165
...to perform one last song!

980
01:02:43,165 --> 01:02:47,565
But before that, I want to say thank you guys so much...

981
01:02:47,565 --> 01:02:50,165
...for waiting for such a long time.

982
01:02:50,165 --> 01:02:53,665
Two and a half years, I think, roughly...

983
01:02:53,665 --> 01:02:57,765
...until we got to this point, which is unusually long.

984
01:02:57,765 --> 01:03:00,465
But yeah, we all were patient...

985
01:03:00,465 --> 01:03:02,665
...and I think it was worth it.

986
01:03:02,665 --> 01:03:04,665
I hope so! Was it worth it?

987
01:03:04,665 --> 01:03:08,165
Well, I practiced really hard for this day.

988
01:03:08,165 --> 01:03:11,965
And I tried really hard to fix my throat for this day.

989
01:03:11,965 --> 01:03:14,465
So I hope you guys enjoyed it.

990
01:03:14,465 --> 01:03:17,465
It was a very special day for me.

991
01:03:17,465 --> 01:03:20,165
I was really nervous...

992
01:03:20,165 --> 01:03:24,165
...but I hope I could show you all the beautiful parts...

993
01:03:24,165 --> 01:03:27,665
...all the good things about Takanashi Kiara!

994
01:03:27,665 --> 01:03:30,565
Yeah, let's do more in the future, okay?

995
01:03:30,565 --> 01:03:31,665
Okay.

996
01:03:31,665 --> 01:03:33,665
So with that, the last song...

997
01:03:33,665 --> 01:03:34,765

I don't wanna stop it yet

1001
01:03:42,665 --> 01:03:44,365
Playin' Russian Roulette

There's somethin' special about you

Oh ya now, gotta get ya, oh ya now

1008

I just can't resist you

1012
01:04:06,465 --> 01:04:08,665
Your eyes are like a spell that I can't break through

1013
01:04:08,665 --> 01:04:10,665
You're captivating me

1014
01:04:11,365 --> 01:04:12,865
But I don't know baby

1015
01:04:12,865 --> 01:04:15,665
You're captivating me

1016
01:04:15,665 --> 01:04:17,665
And in the end you'll let me go

1017
01:04:17,665 --> 01:04:19,665
That's just what we do...

1018
01:04:19,665 --> 01:04:23,465
Love, hate, all the same / If you know, play the game

1019
01:04:23,465 --> 01:04:25,665
I'm all locked up-up inside

1020
01:04:25,665 --> 01:04:27,665
No I can't fight the feeling and I won't try

1021
01:04:28,665 --> 01:04:31,665
All the same / If you know, play the game

1022
01:04:31,665 --> 01:04:33,465
Baby you decide

01:04:33,465 --> 01:04:35,665

Spark me like a flame

1029

In the end love's just all a game

1032

Don't ever let yourself fall in, you got it?

1033
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:56,665
'Cause love's just like a toxin

1034
01:04:56,665 --> 01:04:58,665
The way pain is so common

1035
01:04:58,665 --> 01:05:00,165
No problem, I can't solve it!

1036
01:05:00,257 --> 01:05:01,977
Save me, I'm just a fool in love

1037
01:05:01,977 --> 01:05:04,077
Know that this more than a crush

1038
01:05:04,077 --> 01:05:05,877
So you can't save me

1039
01:05:05,877 --> 01:05:07,577
I'm in too deep

1040
01:05:07,577 --> 01:05:08,877
And I love the rush, yeah

1041
01:05:08,877 --> 01:05:10,677
I just can't resist you

1042
01:05:10,677 --> 01:05:12,677
Your eyes are like a spell

1043
01:05:12,677 --> 01:05:14,777
that I can't break through

1044
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:16,577
And that should scare me

1045
01:05:16,577 --> 01:05:18,677
But I don't know baby

1046
01:05:18,677 --> 01:05:20,677
You're captivating me

1047
01:05:20,677 --> 01:05:23,877
And in the end you'll let me down

1048
01:05:23,877 --> 01:05:25,877
Love, hate, all the same

1049
01:05:25,877 --> 01:05:27,877
If you know, play the game

1050
01:05:27,877 --> 01:05:29,977
Locked up deep inside

1051
01:05:29,977 --> 01:05:32,577
No I can't fight the feeling and I won't try

1052
01:05:32,577 --> 01:05:34,577
All the same

1053
01:05:34,577 --> 01:05:36,577
If you know, play the game

1054
01:05:36,577 --> 01:05:38,377

I'm by you night and day

1066
01:06:01,977 --> 01:06:03,877
How can somethin' so wrong

1067
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:05,777
Be making me feel so right

1068
01:06:05,777 --> 01:06:07,877
Breakin' me down, down
