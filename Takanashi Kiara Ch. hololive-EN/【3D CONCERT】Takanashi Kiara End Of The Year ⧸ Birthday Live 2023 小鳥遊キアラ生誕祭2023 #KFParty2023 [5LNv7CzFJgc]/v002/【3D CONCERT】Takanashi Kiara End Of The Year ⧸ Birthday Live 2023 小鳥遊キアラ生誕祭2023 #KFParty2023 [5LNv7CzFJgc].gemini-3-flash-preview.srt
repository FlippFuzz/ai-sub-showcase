Around the world, everyone says

7
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:45,320
That love is just like a dream

8
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,040
Feel like I'm melting from the heat

9
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,950
Love it, it feels so surreal

10
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,640
Oh yeah

11
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,480
Ooh, just like that, you know just how it goes

12
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,000
Don't ever stop

13
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:01,466
...already know.

14
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:03,066
You're just so sweet, my favorite.

15
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:04,616
Got me wanting more, so tasty, yeah.

16
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:05,866
I ain't got no worries.

17
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:06,866
I feel good, good, good.

18
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:08,216
The warm sun on me.

19
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,316
I wanna go and party.

20
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,666
Don't let this love end.

21
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:11,866
No, I won't pretend.

22
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:13,366
My best recipe for love is you plus me.

23
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:14,516
I wanna try it now.

24
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,116
Try it now!

25
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:15,666
Hey!

26
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:17,566
I'm going one, two, one, two, three.

27
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,766
It tastes so, so, so sweet.

28
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,116
When you go and kiss me.

29
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:21,416
I'm taking that perfect picture.

30
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:22,666
You stuck to me like a sticker.

31
00:05:22,816 --> 00:05:24,666
I'm going one, two, one, two, three.

32
00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:25,866
It tastes so, so, so sweet.

33
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:27,266
Go that way.

34
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,416
I-ye-ye-ye, I-ye-ye-ye.

35
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:29,666
Keep going, you know me.

36
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:30,816
I-ye-ye-ye, I-ye-ye-ye.

37
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:31,316
Hey!

38
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,666
I'm way too beat to be naively sweet.

39
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:33,866
So sweet, it's hypnotizing.

40
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,166
Got you dancing to my beat.

41
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:36,316
You can be my boo.

42
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,516
Can you see me, see me?

43
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:38,816
Babe, I need you gimme, gimme.

44
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,016
No more hesitation, don't think twice.

45
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:40,666
'Cause you're mine.

46
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:41,916
The warm sun on me.

47
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:43,116
I wanna go and party.

48
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:44,366
Don't let this love end.

49
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:45,716
No, I won't pretend.

50
00:05:45,816 --> 00:05:47,066
My best recipe for love is you plus me.

51
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,266
I wanna try it now.

52
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:48,816
Try it now!

53
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:49,316
Hey!

54
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,266
I'm going one, two, one, two, three.

55
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:52,516
It tastes so, so, so sweet.

56
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,816
When you go and kiss me.

57
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,116
I'm taking that perfect picture.

58
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:56,366
You stuck to me like a sticker.

59
00:05:56,516 --> 00:05:58,316
I'm going one, two, one, two, three.

60
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,616
It tastes so, so, so sweet.

61
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:00,916
Go that way.

62
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:02,066
I-ye-ye-ye, I-ye-ye-ye.

63
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,266
Keep going, you know me.

64
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,516
I-ye-ye-ye, I-ye-ye-ye.

65
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:05,016
Pineapple!

66
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:05,616
Hey!

67
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,666
Pineapple, pineapple, pin-ya.

68
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:08,966
Come on boys, let's go!

69
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:10,916
Pineapple, pineapple, pin-ya.

70
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:12,616
Come on baby, do it over, over.

71
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:13,816
Hold my hand and let's fly.

72
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,066
And let's take it to...

73
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:16,916
...the sky!

74
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:18,866
I'm going one, two, one, two, three.

75
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:20,166
It tastes so, so, so sweet.

76
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:21,466
When you go and kiss me.

77
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:22,766
I'm taking that perfect picture.

78
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:24,016
You stuck to me like a sticker.

79
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:25,966
I'm going one, two, one, two, three.

80
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:27,216
It tastes so, so, so sweet.

81
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:28,516
Go that way.

82
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:29,666
I-ye-ye-ye, I-ye-ye-ye.

83
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:30,866
Keep going, you know me.

84
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,116
I-ye-ye-ye, I-ye-ye-ye.

85
00:06:32,216 --> 00:06:32,616
Pineapple!

86
00:06:32,716 --> 00:06:33,166
Hey!

87
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,716
Waking up in shades of blue.

88
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:10,766
VOICE
Lyrics • Composition: KIRA

89
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:07,366
I don't know where I am or how I got to you.

90
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,416
Try to reach out but I can't move.

91
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:13,416
I'm like a broken instrument, so out of tune.

92
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:23,666
Why won't they listen to me anyway?

93
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:26,366
I wanna be and I'm not gonna say I'm sorry.

94
00:08:26,516 --> 00:08:28,916
Just so you let me stay, no.

95
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:34,316
Whatever you think of me, leave it alone.

96
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,916
I don't wanna live in the shade of her throne.

97
00:08:42,016 --> 00:08:44,466
I keep hearing pieces of a melody playing in my head.

98
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:47,116
Fragments of a past that won't let me forget.

99
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:49,716
Someone that I used to be hanging on the edge...

100
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:52,316
...of a blurry silhouette. I wonder...

101
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,916
...when you look at me who do you remember?

102
00:08:55,016 --> 00:08:57,566
Broken memories tied us together.

103
00:08:57,766 --> 00:09:01,616
Tell me honestly do you recognize my voice?

104
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:03,166
Voice.

105
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:07,166
Thin air, so hard to breathe.

106
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:09,816
The wall that I'm facing is just too cold and too lonely.

107
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,466
Wish that I still could feel, still could feel the things...

108
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:15,066
...that back then I used to feel.

109
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,466
Oh, and all I ever wanted was to be accepted by you.

110
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:22,166
Wish that you and I still laughed and that's only my wish.

111
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,266
Why won't you listen to me anyway?

112
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:31,916
I'm gonna be and I'm not gonna say I'm sorry.

113
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:34,466
Just to stay, stay.

114
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:40,016
Whatever you think of me, leave it alone.

115
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:42,566
I don't wanna live in the shade of her throne, oh.

116
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:50,066
I keep hearing pieces of a melody playing in my head.

117
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,666
Fragments of a past that won't let me forget.

118
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:55,366
Someone that I used to be hanging on the edge...

119
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,966
...of a blurry silhouette.

120
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,858
The blurry silhouette...

121
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:03,958
...I wonder...

122
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,758
...when you look at me, who do you remember?

123
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:08,858
Broken memories, time we spent together

124
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,558
Tell me honestly, do you recognize...

125
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:13,158
...my voice? Voice?

126
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:17,958
It looks so odd to me...

127
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,258
...the picture you paint of us

128
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:22,958
I don't need to remember

129
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,858
Let me be, take me just as I am as...

130
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,958
...everything disappears

131
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,458
I shout to heaven's seven!

132
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,458
Let me be, take me just as I am, yeah

133
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,058
Let me be, take me just as I am, yeah

134
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:57,958
I keep praying

135
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,258
Fragments of a melody playing in my head

136
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:04,358
Fragments of a past that they won't let me forget

137
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:06,558
I'm more than I used to be hanging on the edge...

138
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:09,558
...of the blurry silhouette I wonder...

139
00:11:09,558 --> 00:11:12,658
...when you look at me, who do you remember?

140
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:14,858
Broken memories, time we spent together

141
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:18,758
Tell me honestly, do you think that I could ever...

142
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:22,458
...find a voice to call my own?

143
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,458
Voice! Voice!

144
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,958
Voice! Voice!

That cute person is my share

Everyone else is so ordinary, no good

Where did you throw the lucky dice?

The legend still has holes in it

00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,658

Then it's unequal with a boyfriend

165

計算ずくでもあたふた
Even if it's calculated, I'm flustered

誰も承知でへっちゃら
Everyone knows and doesn't care

168
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:47,258
恋の行方はありがたいただけ
The destination of love is just gratefully accepted

Please give me like-like-like-like

172
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:11,458
スキスキスキスキは故障中
Like-like-like-like is out of order

173
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:16,658
スキスキスキスキはひとりじゃ
Like-like-like-like can't be done alone

174
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:21,858
スキスキスキスキだれもできません
Like-like-like-like, nobody can do it [alone]

00:16:05,969 --> 00:16:09,936
言葉にすれば消えちゃう関係なら　言葉を消せばいいやって思ってた
If it's a relationship that vanishes when put into words, I thought it'd be better to just erase the words

192
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:13,836
恐れてた　だけどあれ？なんか違うかも
I was afraid, but wait? Something might be different

193
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:17,919
千里の道も一歩から　石のように固いそんな意志で
A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, with a will as hard as a stone

194
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,836
塵も積もれば大和撫子？　「し」抜きで　いや「し」抜きで
Even dust when piled up becomes a Yamato Nadeshiko? Without the "shi"... no, without the "shi"!

195
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:25,936
ふわふわり　ふわふわる　あなたが名前を呼ぶ
Softly floating, lightly drifting, you call my name

196
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:29,919
それだけで宙へ浮かぶ
Just that makes me float into space

197
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,886
ふわふわる　ふわふわり　あなたが笑っている
Lightly drifting, softly floating, you are smiling

198
00:16:33,886 --> 00:16:37,903
それだけで笑顔になる
Just that makes me smile

199
00:16:37,903 --> 00:16:41,886
神様ありがとう　運命のいたずらでも
Thank you, God, even if it's a prank of fate

私のこと見ててね　ずっとずっと
Please keep watching me, forever and ever

207
00:17:25,986 --> 00:17:29,986
私の中のあなたほど　あなたの中の私の存在はまだまだ
As much as you are within me, my presence within you is still far from it

208
00:17:29,986 --> 00:17:33,886
大きくないこともわかってるけれど
I know it's not that big yet

209
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,903
今この同じ瞬間　共有してる時間
Right now, this same moment, the time we are sharing

210
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:41,886
塵も積もれば大和撫子？　略してちりつもやまとなでこ！
Even dust when piled up becomes a Yamato Nadeshiko? In short, Chiritsumo Yamato Nadeko!

211
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:45,936
くらくらり　くらくらる　あなたを見上げたら
Dizzy, spinning, when I look up at you

それだけで眩しすぎて

Spinning, dizzy, I am thinking of you

214
00:17:53,936 --> 00:17:57,936

アロナ！アキロゼんたーるです！
Alona! I'm Aki Rosenthal!

240
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:18,395
We danced Renai Circulation together.

241
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:21,395
But before that, we danced with Matsuri-senpai, right?

242
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:23,395
So let's get Matsuri-senpai!

243
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,695
元気に！お…ちょっと服が違うけどね。
Energetically! Oh... the outfit is a bit different though.

00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:53,895
I want to ask a question.

For me, it was being able to spend a fun time with the listeners this year too.

260
00:21:40,395 --> 00:21:43,395
Her favorite thing was just being with the viewers...

261
00:21:43,395 --> 00:21:46,395
...and hers was, you know, being a crepe maker, which was really good, yeah.

せっかく三人今いますから、ま、アキゼの家に行ってご飯食べたい。
Since the three of us are here, I want to go to Aki-ze's house and eat.

269
00:22:23,895 --> 00:22:27,395
それこそね、ほらダンスできるから、ダンスもね、一緒にやりたい。
Exactly, we can dance, so I want to dance together too.

270
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:36,095
ゲームもしたい。と英語も教えてほしい。
I want to play games too. And I want you to teach me English.

271
00:22:39,095 --> 00:22:43,695
二人に英語教えられる英語メンバーはいっぱいいますから…
There are many English members who can teach you two English...

272
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,395
私はドイツ語教えてあげる！
...so I'll teach you German!

273
00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:50,695
Guten Morgenってドイツ語？
Is 'Guten Morgen' German?

274
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:52,395
そうそうそう！おはようございます。
Yes, yes, yes! It means good morning.

275
00:22:53,895 --> 00:22:57,395
So maybe we'll, you know, we'll get some cooking collabs next year...

276
00:22:57,395 --> 00:23:00,895
...maybe some dancing, and maybe I'll teach them German, who knows.

287
00:23:59,095 --> 00:24:01,895
同じことなんてしたくない
I don't want to do the same things

288
00:24:02,395 --> 00:24:05,395
人と同じである意味信じない
I don't believe in the meaning of being the same as others

289
00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:09,895
だって皆違うのに
Because everyone is different

290
00:24:11,395 --> 00:24:16,395
何度でも生まれてやるんだ
I'll be reborn as many times as it takes

291
00:24:16,395 --> 00:24:21,695
何度でも格好つけないままでいいじゃん
It's fine to stay uncool as many times as it takes

292

未完成で死ぬまでカンカン
Unfinished and blazing until death

293
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:28,695
誰でも土砂降り雨でも
Anyone, even in a downpour

294
00:24:28,695 --> 00:24:31,895
吹雪の夜でも
Even on a blizzard night

295
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,395
倒れたって起き上がれる
Even if I fall, I can get back up

296
00:24:36,395 --> 00:24:39,095
踏まれて 踏まれて 踏まれて
Being stepped on, stepped on, stepped on

297
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:42,395
もっと強くなるんだ
I will become even stronger

298
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:45,095
Keep your head up

299
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:47,895

名前を持たない 道端の草みたいに
Like a weed on the roadside without a name

305
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:12,406
誰にも知られていない気分はどうだい
How does it feel to be known by no one?

306
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,540
言い訳してる暇はない
There's no time for making excuses

307
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,840
落ち込んでるそんな場合じゃない
This is no time to be feeling down

308
00:25:20,673 --> 00:25:23,140
そうさ時代は変わるよ
That's right, the times are changing

309
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,640
生きてるだけで
Just being alive

310
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,840
奇跡だって
Is a miracle

311
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,740
俺たち
We are...

312
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,640
ボロボロになったっていいじゃん
It's okay if we're worn to tatters

313
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,040
ゴールドなんて
Things like gold

314
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,340
まだまだ石ころ
Are still just pebbles

315
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,340
道でも 線路の脇でも
On the road, or by the railroad tracks

316
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,040
歩道の端でも
Or even at the edge of the sidewalk

317
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,740
根っ子生やしてやればいい
All we need to do is take root

318
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,440
蹴られて 蹴られて 蹴られて
Kicked, kicked, kicked

319
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,340
何か見つけ出すんだ
We'll find something

320
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,340
You can do it

321
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,140
諦めんじゃねえ
Don't you give up

322
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,340
夢見て 夢見て
Dreaming, dreaming

323
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,840
笑って 笑って
Laughing, laughing

324
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,540
悩んで 悩んで
Worrying, worrying

325
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,640
涙流してもいいんだ
It's okay to shed tears

326
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,640
夢中で 夢中で
Obsessed, obsessed

327
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,540
不安で 不安で
Anxious, anxious

328
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,540
叫んで 叫んで
Screaming, screaming

329
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,640
求め続けてやろうぜ
Let's keep on searching

330
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,640
カンカン照りでも
Even under a blazing sun

331
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,640
土砂降り雨でも
Or in a downpour of rain

332
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,340
吹雪の夜でも
Even on a blizzard night

333
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,340
倒れたって起き上がれる
Even if we fall, we can get back up

334
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,440
踏まれて 踏まれて 踏まれて
Stepped on, stepped on, stepped on

335
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,340
もっと強くなるんだ
We'll become even stronger

336
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,540
Keep your head up

337
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,840
甘えてんじゃねえ
Don't be so soft

338
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,840
ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！
Hey! Hey! Hey!

339
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,740
ぶちかませ
Let 'em have it

340
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,640
夢見てんじゃねえ
Don't just keep dreaming

341
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,640
あがいて行こうぜ
Let's keep struggling on

342
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,340
ピース
Peace

343
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,340
It’s the birds-eye-view, and the pressure is crazy

344
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,940
Fire N Ice

345
00:27:49,340 --> 00:28:01,340
Fire N Ice
Lyrics: Mori Calliope / TeddyLoid / Composition: TeddyLoid

346
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,340
You better step up, drop, roll, and knock off the sweat at the door

347
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,740
Flights like that kind of fire

348
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,140
The Phoenix rises higher

349
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,740
Frigid, frozen, no limits, the cold

350
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,140
Tremble low, tremble low

351
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,740
支配したいの 君の心を
I want to dominate your heart

352
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,740
行こう 望むまま
Let's go, just as you wish

353
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,640
Fired up, fired up now / Hot passion never back down

354
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,940
Freeze up, freeze up now / Not about to vent to you

355
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,740
Fire N Ice, step light now / High pressure, turn it up now

356
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,740
Fire N Ice, fire ice now / This world’s all smoke and mirrors

357
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,740
君の思惑
Your expectations

358
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,740
超えて超えて
Surpass them, surpass them

359
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,740
知りたい気持ちなんだ
It's a feeling of wanting to know

360
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,640
冷めた醒めた
Chilled, awakened

361
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,740
Blazing, unchanging, no safe thing about this heat

362
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,040
Witness me, hit the speed, transcribe script

363
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,540
Feeling’s got me freezing now

364
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,740
執着させてよ
Let me get attached

365
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,740
体中今 駆け巡らせば
If it surges through my whole body now

366
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,040
Control, overflow

367
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:16,840
掴まえたいの 君の心を
I want to catch your heart

368
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,040
でもね だって
But you see, because...

369
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,740
Fired up, fired up now / Hot passion never back down

370
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,040
Freeze up, freeze up now / Not about to vent to you

371
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,640
Fire N Ice, step light now / High pressure, turn it up now

372
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,740
Fire N Ice, fire ice now / This world’s all smoke and mirrors

373
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,740
煩いその口
That noisy mouth of yours

374
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,740
閉じて閉じて
Close it, close it

375
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,740
許せないの今は
I can't forgive it right now

376
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
止めて止めて
Stop it, stop it

377
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,340
Caught up in the eye of a storm of flames / It’s not complicated but a nuanced game

378
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,940
Pass you once again give you something I can’t shake / The chance to know somebody who takes moves to make

379
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,340
So what you waiting for you gotta burn it up / Because when it rains it pours you gotta earn the love

380
00:30:02,098 --> 00:30:03,598
Giving me next and never get enough

381
00:30:03,698 --> 00:30:05,198
Cause you and I are spies above, you got it?

382
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:07,198
Fire it up, fire it up now

383
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,198
High pressure never back down

384
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:10,898
Freeze it out, freeze it out now

385
00:30:11,298 --> 00:30:12,598
Not about to bend to you

386
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:14,898
Fire and ice death and life now

387
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:16,698
High pressure turn it up loud

388
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:18,598
Fire and ice fire and ice now

389
00:30:18,998 --> 00:30:20,698
This world's a smoke and mirror

390
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:24,198
君の思うがままに
Exactly as you wish

391
00:30:26,198 --> 00:30:28,198
超えて超えて
Crossing over, crossing over

392
00:30:30,198 --> 00:30:32,198
ちょっと息を止めて
Hold your breath for a moment

393
00:30:34,198 --> 00:30:36,198
寒さの中で
Within the cold

394
00:30:39,198 --> 00:30:40,698
Thank you everybody!

395
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:43,298
Whoa! Hype hype hype hype hype!

396
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:46,798
TakaMori! TakaMori!

397
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:50,798
Thank you so much everybody!

398
00:30:50,898 --> 00:30:52,798
How was it? How was it? Do you like it?

399
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:55,298
I hope so. We worked very hard on that.
That's our brand new song!

400
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:57,298
Our brand new song! But since we wanted
to talk more about it...

401
00:30:57,398 --> 00:31:00,298
...we're gonna get down closer to you guys
so you can hear us, right?

402
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:01,298
That's right. You guys can hear us properly?

403
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:03,298
Hello! We're gonna jump, right?

404
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:05,798
Yes, are you ready to jump? It's pretty far.

405
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:09,298
Wait, are you sure? Okay... let's go!

406
00:31:10,298 --> 00:31:14,298
Kiara, okay! AHH!

407
00:31:15,298 --> 00:31:17,298
Swag! Hey! Hey!

408
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:22,798
Easy, so easy. Easy. Such a high jump up there.

409
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,798
I can't believe we didn't die.
Must be because of me.

410
00:31:25,898 --> 00:31:28,298
That's crazy. Oh man, nice!

411
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:30,298
You guys hear us and see us better now?

412
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:32,798
Hello, hello! Hi! Loud and clear. TakaMori!

413
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:37,298
TakaMori! TakaMori! Welcome, welcome, welcome!

414
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:39,798
I hope you guys enjoyed the song.

415
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,298
I think it was hype. I think so too. It was hype.

416
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:44,298
It's a banger. It's a banger. It's a banger.

417
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:48,798
So now we can talk about the song,
and I think you know the most details about it.

418
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:49,798
So give me the deets!

419
00:31:49,898 --> 00:31:53,298
Well, this song has been in the works
for about two years.

420
00:31:53,798 --> 00:31:58,298
A long time. Hey, everyone's really
busy in Holo, right?

421
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:00,298
But you know what?
It was finally time to finish it.

422
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,798
Yeah, cause I said, "Calli, I'm doing
this birthday live thing..."

423
00:32:03,898 --> 00:32:07,798
"...do you maybe want to release it in time
for that?" And that kind of got us rolling.

424
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,298
Finally got the ball rolling, got it moving.
And um, it's called "Fire N Ice".

425
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,798
Which I couldn't... Are you fire? No. Am I fire?

426
00:32:17,298 --> 00:32:20,298
Is that a real question? She's messing
with me. She knows.

427
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:23,798
I'm the fire! And you're the ice! Oh god.

428
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:26,798
The song is about us, and that we're very different...

429
00:32:26,898 --> 00:32:30,298
...but when we get together, we make magic happen.
Bangers, etc.

430
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:33,798
Yeah, that was the basic idea.
And it's produced by TeddyLoid...

431
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:38,298
...who always makes bangers. TeddyLoid
always makes bangers. So thank you.

432
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:41,798
Arigatou gozaimasu. Lyrics by both
myself and TeddyLoid.

433
00:32:41,898 --> 00:32:44,798
So I hope you guys enjoy it. The music
video is on my channel.

434
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:48,298
It came out like a couple days ago,
so go check it out.

435
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:51,798
It's so cool. And the music video is really
neat. It's by Kanaru.

436
00:32:52,298 --> 00:32:55,798
Kanaru who also always only makes bangers.
So be sure you check it.

437
00:32:59,298 --> 00:33:01,298
Should we show them the jacket?

438
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:03,798
The jacket? Oh, yeah, the jacket. Check it out.

439
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:07,298
You guys, jacket? We're selling a jacket?
Oh my god, she's messing with me again.

440
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:11,298
Check it out, ta-da! There it is.

441
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,298
We're a meme right now. Hold on, ja-jaan!
Oh, it's super nice.

442
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:22,298
Who drew the jacket? It was by Gumshue.
Thank you so much, Gumshue.

443
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,298
Wow, wow, kamsahamnida. Oh, okay.
We're running out of time, but I also want to say...
Wow, wow, thank you. Oh, okay.
We're running out of time, but I also want to say...

444
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:31,798
...we came from, you know, small TakaMori
doing like little cover like "Wowa World"...

445
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:35,798
...and now we have original song. Thank you,
Calli, for organizing it. Yeah, no problem.

446
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,298
Dankeschön. And yeah, look at us being cute.
Wow, we look nice together. Pose!

447
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:53,298
恥ずかしい。 It's so embarrassing.
This is embarrassing. It's so embarrassing.

448
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:58,798
Wait, thank you for supporting TakaMori.
I guess we look cute, maybe? Very cute.

449
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:03,798
Dankeschön. All right, Calli, thanks for having me.
Thank you for coming and dancing with me.

450
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:06,298
It was so fun! Thank you! I'm getting
kicked out again.

451
00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:09,298
Yes, sorry. I figured as much. Bye bye!

452
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:13,298
See you soon. Oh well, good luck! Enjoy
everybody! Bye bye!

453
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:15,298
Peace!

454
00:34:16,298 --> 00:34:18,798
And with that, I still have a lot more songs for you guys.

455
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:20,798
まだまだいっぱいありますよ！
There's still plenty more!

536
00:39:35,683 --> 00:39:38,183
Passing by familiar roads

537
00:39:38,183 --> 00:39:42,083
I couldn't find the reason why

538
00:39:35,683 --> 00:39:42,083
The Great Wanderer

539
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:48,183
Who I am you couldn't know

540
00:39:48,183 --> 00:39:53,183
Stuck in the ruins of my delusion

541
00:39:54,483 --> 00:39:58,083
In between the two realities

542
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:00,883
My own desire keeps me higher

543
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,333
...to you

544
00:40:03,608 --> 00:40:04,891
Ooh...

545
00:40:05,266 --> 00:40:07,683
Moving faster than the light can

546
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,291
I'm in the absence

547
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:13,166
Alone looking back

548
00:40:13,608 --> 00:40:15,325
Did I lose my way?

549
00:40:15,525 --> 00:40:18,233
I can't see the day

550
00:40:18,408 --> 00:40:20,766
When I can reach you again

551
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:22,691
And then I let go

552
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:25,408
I can hear your voice

553
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:28,316
Leading me through the void

554
00:40:28,483 --> 00:40:29,941
Fade away

555
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:32,066
Through the gray

556
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,983
Eternally I'm walking by

557
00:40:35,091 --> 00:40:37,583
The lands of push before my eyes alone

558
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:40,033
The silence deafening

559
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:42,575
Still reaching out to you

560
00:40:42,783 --> 00:40:45,058
Connections lost, the vice of light

561
00:40:45,158 --> 00:40:47,691
It turns to dust, so I'll survive one day

562
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:50,091
Eventually the light

563
00:40:50,225 --> 00:40:52,650
It will lead me back to you see me

564
00:41:14,566 --> 00:41:17,316
Faith is gone, the well is drying

565
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,691
No more believing

566
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:22,400
Just deceiving

567
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:23,958
Ooh...

568
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:26,883
Feel the daylight on the edge of pulse

569
00:41:26,975 --> 00:41:29,308
I can't feel the beat

570
00:41:29,483 --> 00:41:32,066
Fall back into sleep

571
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,666
Did I lose my way?

572
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:37,566
I can't see the day

573
00:41:37,658 --> 00:41:40,383
When I can reach you again

574
00:41:40,516 --> 00:41:42,316
And then I let go

575
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:45,108
I can hear your voice

576
00:41:45,275 --> 00:41:47,883
Leading me through the void

577
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:49,658
Fade away

578
00:41:50,016 --> 00:41:52,058
Through the gray

579
00:41:52,225 --> 00:41:54,733
Eternally I'm walking by

580
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:57,108
The lands of push before my eyes alone

581
00:41:57,258 --> 00:41:59,725
The silence deafening

582
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,383
Still reaching out to you

583
00:42:02,608 --> 00:42:04,958
Connections lost, the vice of light

584
00:42:05,058 --> 00:42:07,566
It turns to dust, so I'll survive one day

585
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:09,958
Eventually the light

586
00:42:10,091 --> 00:42:12,291
It will lead me back to you see me

587
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,266
That was TGW, "The Great Wanderer"!

588
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,341
You were all waiting for that one, weren't you? Me too, me too!

589
00:43:08,441 --> 00:43:13,233
Ah, I feel like the vibe was definitely there. Did you feel it? Ah...

590
00:43:16,108 --> 00:43:20,766
"The Great Wanderer" on my album, Point of View right now! So if you want to hear more of that...

591
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:23,616
If that was the first time you heard it, then what are you doing?

592
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:25,683
Go listen to my album, please!

593
00:43:26,491 --> 00:43:30,758
Yeah, I really like the choreo, so I hope I can dance to it again sometime soon.

594
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:34,666
And actually, I don't know if you know it yet...

595
00:43:34,975 --> 00:43:38,208
But right after this—because this is, you know, as you can see, already ending soon...

596
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,608
もうすぐ終わるんですけど...
It's ending soon, but...

597
00:43:40,683 --> 00:43:42,616
実はこのあとメン限あります！
Actually, there's a members-only part after this!

598
00:43:42,691 --> 00:43:45,975
There is a members-only part following right after this!

599
00:43:46,608 --> 00:43:49,566
So please check it out. It's the first time I get to do something like that.

600
00:43:49,658 --> 00:43:51,916
So it's really exciting for me.

601
00:43:52,008 --> 00:43:54,791
My members, I hope you will enjoy what I have prepared for you.

602
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:57,108
Just a little bit, you know, just a little bit extra.

603
00:43:58,241 --> 00:44:01,591
Yeah, and besides that, of course, I just mentioned I want to, you know, talk about my album...

604
00:44:01,758 --> 00:44:05,975
Because originally I wanted to do this live during the time when the album was released...

605
00:44:06,075 --> 00:44:08,408
But didn't quite work out. So let me say it now, guys!

606
00:44:10,308 --> 00:44:16,775
私のアルバムから、いくつもね、今日、新曲を披露させていただきましたけども、
I performed several new songs from my album today, but...

607
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:19,250
聴いてますか？
Are you listening to them?

608
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:22,358
Point of View on Spotify, on Amazon Music, on Apple Music...

609
00:44:22,466 --> 00:44:27,316
Everywhere! Please listen to Point of View!

610
00:44:29,941 --> 00:44:32,275

Thank you guys so much for waiting for this.

612
00:44:36,283 --> 00:44:39,975
I'm so happy that today is finally the day that I can show off some of my new songs...

613
00:44:40,075 --> 00:44:44,275
...some of my old songs and have some great guests over.

614
00:44:44,858 --> 00:44:47,091
Yeah, did you enjoy everything?

615
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,791
What was your favorite performance? What was your favorite guest? Hm? Hm? Hm?

616
00:44:49,891 --> 00:44:51,858
Me too! Oh, what a coincidence!

617
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:56,975
Mm, yes. Uh, well, besides this...

618
00:44:57,075 --> 00:44:59,975
This stream is End Of The Year Concert...

619
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:01,775
...so I want to say...

620
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,020
Hello everybody.

621
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,720

thank you for supporting Hololive English and Hololive as a whole.

624
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,420
And me as a musician, of course,

625
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,020
this year was all about that.

626
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:18,020
Me creating my album and, yeah, more musical activities.

627
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,720
So let's see where the new year, the new year 2024 will lead us to.

628
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,420
Hopefully more music.

629
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,720
And you guys are gonna join me, right?

630
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,020

631
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:31,020

Thank you, everyone.

And the last song, next song is the last song. It's also from my album.

635
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,320
次の曲がラストの曲なんですけど、
The next song is the last song,

636
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,720
