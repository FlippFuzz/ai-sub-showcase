Perfume Remix by
The Gravy Navy

3
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,800
Ow!

4
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,100
Huh!

5
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,100
Come chase me.

6
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
HIT ME UP
Lyrics: KiRA / monii | Music: KiRA / monii / Johnny R.

7
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
Every day I spring-cleaning but

8
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,500
almost love's turned complicated

9
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,000
On the way up my heart got torn up

10
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,500
shredded all but deadened

11
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,800
Now they say I, I'm just a masochist or sick of it

12
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,700
Boy take a hint, you ain't gon' ever get this

13
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,500
Pedal to the metal shooting straight to the stars

14
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,400
Got a craving like a danger on the edge
she liked that, liked that, liked that

15
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,800
Up another level, sensation you just can't deny

16
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,700
Come get a taste, but can't say I won't bite

17
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,800
Supersonic I'm heading up I'm gonna (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

18
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,300
In my eyes Nirvana (Oh, I'm taking)

19
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,800
Pushing for the high, my lover, I gotta (Run-run-run-run)

20
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,800
But it's fun to see you try

21
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,400
So hit me up, off the map

22
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
I'ma take it all, my energy

23
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,200
Speeding up, fast ready, target lock

24
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,400
So hit me up, hit the dash

25
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm a grader, and you wanna be

26
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,000
So hit me up, I'll never stop

27
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,700
In a new territory, I'm on the edge of glory

28
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,300
Boy just watch out, give me that rush

29
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,400
Got no regrets in my mind, boy don't lose the time

30
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,300
So hit me up, I'll turn the volume up, you got a crush

31
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,500
Such a cliché, you're a bad boy charm

32
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,000
better fall right back in your arms

33
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,900
Wasn't enough, you needed more

34
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,300
now you're begging to let you score

35
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,700
Sure you'll take it all in stride, oh I'm busy tonight

36
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,900
Goodbye, goodbye, gotta leave you dry

37
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,700
Always tryna play it cool, 20/20 vision on me

38
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,300
Just outside my field of view
yes she liked that, liked that, liked that

39
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Engine booming, that's my cue, catch me if you can

40
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,600
You better keep up the chase, boy you falling behind

41
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,800
Supersonic I'm heading up I'm gonna (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

42
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,200
In my eyes Nirvana (Oh, I'm taking)

43
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,700
Pushing for the high, my lover, I gotta (Run-run-run-run)

44
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,000
But it's fun to see you try

45
00:05:00,008 --> 00:06:12,449
HIT ME UP

46
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,008
Fun to see you try

47
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:07,408
Center of the map, I'ma take it all my energy

48
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:10,508
Speeding up fast, ready, tag along

49
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:14,008
Head to dash, I'm a-grade and you wanna be this

50
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:17,508
So hit me up, ah, and never stop

51
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:22,508
In a new territory, I'm on the edge of glory,

52
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:25,008
boy, just watch how I move, gimme that rush

53
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:27,508
Got no regrets on my mind,

54
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:30,008
but it's on you this time to hit me up,

55
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:32,008
on the loud volume up, you've got a crush

56
00:05:32,008 --> 00:05:35,008
Ah, just barely wasn't enough, you should've

57
00:05:35,008 --> 00:05:38,508
Ah, given me all that you got, you could've

58
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:42,008
Coming full circle, I hit a nerve, oh

59
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,508
Top spot's getting hot, watch me run it

60
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:49,008
So hit me up, rev it up and make that vroom vroom

61
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:52,508
When I hit you with that zoom zoom zoom zoom

62
00:05:52,508 --> 00:05:56,008
If you know what's good for you, ooh ooh ooh

63
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:59,008
Fuel me now, I'm back in charge right now after dark

64
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:16,408
Yay! Kikiriki!

65
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:21,408
Welcome to my birthday in 2025!

66
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:23,008
Woohoo!

67
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,008
お誕生日です、私の
It's my birthday.

68
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:28,008
なんと、なんと、何歳になってるんでしょう、この不死鳥。
And, and, how old is this phoenix now?

69
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:31,008
It is my birthday. It is a very special occasion.

70
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:34,508
It is not just my birthday,

71
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:38,008
it is also the Super Special Summer!

72
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:42,508
We will make it a Super Special Summer today. Yes, yes!

73
00:06:42,508 --> 00:06:47,008
And if you guys want, I have a hashtag up here, so please make use of it.

74
00:06:47,008 --> 00:06:50,008
It is #KiaraBDay2025!

75
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:53,508
So post it all over social media.

76
00:06:53,508 --> 00:06:56,508
Screenshots, or gifs, or jifs, whatever you want.

77
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:59,008
Share it to the world, spread the Wah-Wah-Love!

78
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:02,008
Thank you already in advance.

79
00:07:02,008 --> 00:07:05,508
We started with the first song with KIRA's "HIT ME UP".

80
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,508
KIRA, another banger from my good friend KIRA.

81
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:11,508
Thank you for providing the world with bangers.

82
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:15,008
I'm taking them for myself. Hehe. They're mine now.

83
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:19,008
Yeah, that was fun. And did you like the little spicy dance? Hehe.

84
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:22,008
Let's take a little look at the stage. ステージも見ましょうか。
Let's take a little look at the stage. Let's look at the stage too.

85
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:26,508
Well, besides the Super Special Summer logo, we have some presents.

86
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:30,008
I wonder what's inside. And some balloons.

87
00:07:30,008 --> 00:07:33,508
Maybe I'm gonna pop them when I'm done here. Hehe.

88
00:07:33,508 --> 00:07:36,508
Yes! And then besides that, today, you know why it's so special?

89
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:40,008
Well, because we're gonna have super special merch at the end.

90
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:44,008
We're gonna have super special outside guests!

91
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:48,508
Ah! I never had an outside guest before. Exciting!

92
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:52,008
And, and, and... super special song reveal? Hmm.

93
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:55,008
Yeah, yeah, probably. You know me.

94
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:58,008
So please watch until the very end.

95
00:07:58,008 --> 00:08:00,508
最後まで見てください。
Please watch until the end.

96
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:03,508
特別なサプライズいっぱいありますから。よろしくお願いします。
There are many special surprises. Please look forward to it.

97
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:07,008
Please listen to the next song, "UNDEAD".

98
00:08:09,297 --> 00:10:00,008
UNDEAD (English Version)

99
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:12,508
I'm unhappy! If you're feeling over lot of woes

100
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:15,508
Then you better listen very close

101
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:19,008
Keep on trying, never give up, don't forget that's your life

102
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:22,508
The prospect of then running from the boring future yet to come

103
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:25,008
So counseling you, oh my, oh my, I'm unhappy piece of cake, yeah

104
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:26,508
UNDEAD (English Version)
Lyrics - Music: Ayase
Translation: Konnie Aoki

105
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:27,508
I'm unhappy!

106
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,008
Be happy! UNDEAD! UNDEAD!

107
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:40,008
Hey hey hey hey, somehow feeling like there's a fight within and it's been going on so long

108
00:08:40,008 --> 00:08:43,508
And I'm feeling that I don't even want to show that version of me, of me, of me

109
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:47,008
And those figures of the old transparent ghosts over my route

110
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:50,008
The childish and painful memories have the deepest roots

111
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:53,508
Nowhere to be seen, way better than irony

112
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:57,008
They all see the me of the past when looking at me now

113
00:08:57,008 --> 00:09:00,008
Labels I can't erase, in essence a common place

114
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:04,008
It's almost like something possessing me, it is wrapping 'round

115
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:07,508
And when loose, it's bound to self I used to be before

116
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:10,008
UNDEAD! Still alive!

117
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:14,008
Break the chain of your own catastrophe as I will still always embrace you in changes on and on

118
00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:17,508
Don't settle for unhappiness, don't keep those eyes in stress

119
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:21,008
Now is the time to seize the joy and be happy with power

120
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:24,508
Oh, this whole world is one of, one of fantasy

121
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:28,008
Who knows what is coming up next, a monster or a snake?

122
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:31,508
This is the story starting after that encounter finally

123
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:35,008
With people or monstrous spirits, that's happy piece of cake, yeah

124
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:41,008
Past and future, can't change the past. Past and future, run for the future

125
00:09:41,008 --> 00:09:45,008
Cutting in, somehow feeling like there's nothing to be looking forward to

126
00:09:45,008 --> 00:09:48,508
A hope of time cannot be defined, that's how I'm feeling inside

127
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:52,008
There's nothing left if you live long enough, nothing is new

128
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:56,008
No sign of anything wonderful waiting down the line

129
00:09:56,508 --> 00:10:00,008
Too much knowledge results in feeling like everything is but an unavoidable fate

130
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,316
Running revolution, fearless what I really want now

131
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:03,516
Like a dance to fresh ends

132
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:05,416
This is the way to guidance through

133
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,416
Reshaping compliance too, it's like I'm going under a lift

134
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,316
I consume everything

135
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:11,416
This one or that one or whichever

136
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:15,516
And now it all just stays the same

137
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:18,416
I'm still alive, time is a shade of your own path

138
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,316
In any era you pass by

139
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:23,216
Your future are fixed at this very moment

140
00:10:23,216 --> 00:10:25,416
Fulfill the life you're set up for

141
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,216
And you believe keep moving on

142
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:29,416
Go for that happy ending

143
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,416
I'm still alive, I'm telling this to you now

144
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,516
So never give up on pursuing your happiness, keep it close to you now

145
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:37,316
Seeing only the suffering

146
00:10:37,316 --> 00:10:40,416
Always enduring everything

147
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,216
It's almost as if you're dead or alive, which is it after all?

148
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:45,316
If you're doing your very best now

149
00:10:45,316 --> 00:10:47,316
Then you gotta listen very close

150
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:50,316
Keep on trying never give up, be aware that you're alive

151
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,416
Drowning deep in unhappiness, or feeling that you're happiness

152
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,316
It's only, only, it's all on you

153
00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:57,416
Universe all-embracing

154
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,316
All creation peace be with you yeah

155
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:01,316
Past

156
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:02,416
And future

157
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,416
Can't change the past

158
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,416
Past

159
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,416
And future

160
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,316

00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:33,540
Uh...

469
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,840
My heart starts skipping a bit

470
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,040
今 踊りだシーンショー
Now, let's start the dance scene show

471
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,440
様変わりして Show time
A complete change, it's show time

472
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,040
全然悪くない Imagination
Not bad at all, imagination

473
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,640
視界の霧は晴れ渡って
The mist in my sight has cleared up

474
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,040
悲しみに別れを告げる
Bidding farewell to sadness

475
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,540
すいま まい まつり 掘り出して
Sleepiness and dance festival, dig it out

476

Lalaink wa balailo

478
00:30:03,248 --> 00:30:06,048
どれだけ上手く見せようとしても
No matter how well I try to act

479
00:30:06,548 --> 00:30:09,548
君がいなければ何の意味もない
It means nothing without you

480
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:13,248
かすり傷すらつかない幻想
An illusion without even a scratch

481
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:16,248
針の落ちないレコードさ
Like a record whose needle won't drop

482
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:21,048
たった今 留め処ない追い風背にして
Right now, with an endless tailwind at my back

483
00:30:21,848 --> 00:30:23,548
Come as flow

484
00:30:24,048 --> 00:30:29,548
吹き荒れる向かい風にも心 なびかせて
Letting my heart flutter even in the raging headwind

488
00:30:40,648 --> 00:30:44,048

紛い物 騙し効かない世界
In a world where fakes and deception don't work

The world ahead that no one knows yet

495
00:31:19,448 --> 00:31:22,548
呆感してるだけじゃ味気ない
Just being in a daze is tasteless

496
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,848
リアルタイムで 通じ合って
Connecting in real time

497
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:28,048
ふり幅 限界モーション
The width of the swing, limit motion

498

504
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:47,448
伴っても

やったー！
We did it!

551
00:35:28,956 --> 00:35:33,056
But how was it to dance with, like, a non-ReGLOSS member?

552
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:37,056
It's actually first time to dance together,

553
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:41,556
who is not ReGLOSS member, so I was a little bit nervous, but...

554
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:47,056
Finally, we can do it! Yay! Heart-warming!

555
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:50,056
I think, you know, I chose the white version

556
00:35:50,056 --> 00:35:53,056
of this outfit because I thought we'd look so good together.

557
00:35:53,056 --> 00:35:55,356
Suits on you! Yay!

558
00:35:55,756 --> 00:36:00,056
So, because we look so good together, let's take a cute picture, okay?

559
00:36:00,156 --> 00:36:02,556
Okay! Okay! Yay!

Wait, I- I will go like here.

00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:09,056
No, closer, closer, closer, closer! Okay!

So, we just danced "Feeling Gradation" with these two cute girls from ReGLOSS, but...

571
00:36:35,356 --> 00:36:39,056
I have even more guests coming! And even more songs coming!

572
00:36:39,056 --> 00:36:43,056
And for that, I will go to the center stage.

この地図の指し示す方へ
Toward the direction shown on this map,

631
00:40:45,364 --> 00:40:48,864
君の足跡たどりながら
While tracing your footsteps.

632
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:52,364
憧れを力に変えて
Turning my admiration into strength,

633
00:40:52,364 --> 00:40:54,864
Rock my world, baby.

634
00:40:55,264 --> 00:40:57,864
あれからどれくらい
How much since then...

635
00:40:57,864 --> 00:41:00,864
君に追いつけたんだろう
...have I managed to catch up to you?

636
00:41:01,364 --> 00:41:04,264
いつでも前を行く
Always going ahead of me,

637
00:41:04,264 --> 00:41:07,764
その背中を見つめ続けてきた
I've kept staring at your back.

638

遠い道のり
The long journey...

639
00:41:11,664 --> 00:41:14,564
超えていくたびに
...every time I overcome it,

640
00:41:14,564 --> 00:41:18,064
本当の強さの意味を知るから
Because I learn the meaning of true strength.

641
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,564
全てを投げ出したとしてもまだ
Even if I threw everything away,

642

君との距離感詰めきれなくて

信じて
I'll believe.

660
00:42:17,364 --> 00:42:20,164
たとえ何度も
Even if many times...

661
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:23,064
壁を感じても
...I feel the walls,

662
00:42:23,064 --> 00:42:26,564
茨の道を乗り越えてみせる
I'll show you I can overcome the thorny path.

Hello everybody!

771
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:24,872
My name is Mint Fantome.

772
00:49:24,872 --> 00:49:26,272
I am a ghost maid VTuber.

773
00:49:26,272 --> 00:49:29,072
I'm not a part of Hololive, but I am a big fan of

774
00:49:29,072 --> 00:49:30,872
Miss Takanashi Kiara!

775
00:49:30,872 --> 00:49:33,472
Yeah! It is our first ever 3D appearance

776
00:49:33,472 --> 00:49:34,972
together!

777
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,572
Together!

778
00:49:38,272 --> 00:49:41,172
And we sang a beautiful song that I think

779
00:49:41,172 --> 00:49:43,972
means a lot to both of us!

780
00:49:43,972 --> 00:49:45,372
To both of us! Mmm!

781
00:49:45,372 --> 00:49:47,372
What's it called? It was...

782
00:49:47,372 --> 00:49:49,872
Lady Mermaid!

783
00:49:50,072 --> 00:49:53,372
From... some two beautiful ladies from Hello Project,

784
00:49:53,372 --> 00:49:56,172
Suzuki Airi and Sugaya Risako,

785
00:49:56,172 --> 00:49:58,272
who by now you guys should really

786
00:49:58,272 --> 00:50:00,072
remember those names!

787
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,913
...at the Easter live that I had, okay?

788
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,213
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's 'Hell Project' all over again.

789
00:50:05,213 --> 00:50:07,546
We had a lot of fun with that, right?

790
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:08,413
We did!

791
00:50:08,413 --> 00:50:09,613
Practicing together...

792
00:50:09,613 --> 00:50:10,613
Oh my gosh!

793
00:50:10,613 --> 00:50:11,913
...shaking the booty!

794
00:50:11,913 --> 00:50:14,313
When we were doing practice, every time we would like do the...

795
00:50:14,313 --> 00:50:15,980
...this part, we would stare at each other...

796
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,246
...looking at me! Shaking the booty! Woooo!

797
00:50:18,246 --> 00:50:19,513
So fun! Yeah!

798
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,346
I'm so happy that we're together...

799
00:50:22,346 --> 00:50:23,313
Me too!

800
00:50:23,313 --> 00:50:24,480
...and you're here!

801
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,313
I know!

802
00:50:25,646 --> 00:50:28,880
It's like... it's like... honestly, it really does feel like this is a different timeline...

803
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,780
...where somehow you ended up here!

804
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,280
Oh! Yeah!

805
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,213
Maybe!

806
00:50:34,713 --> 00:50:37,746
It's kind of fun to like... today I'm roleplaying!

807
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:39,346
Yeah, yeah! A little bit!

808
00:50:39,946 --> 00:50:43,080
Ooh, I wonder which generation you're from if you're roleplaying!

809
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:43,846
Oh!

810
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,813
And then I also got to see the big wall of the signatures and everything!

811
00:50:46,813 --> 00:50:47,780
Oh, the signatures!

812
00:50:48,013 --> 00:50:51,680
Yeah, it's been really exciting being here at the Hololive Studio!

813
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,813
So thank you everybody!

814
00:50:52,813 --> 00:50:53,680
Thank you, Kiara-sama!

815
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,413
Thank you for having me!

816
00:50:55,413 --> 00:50:58,413
Yeah, it's my first time having an external guest, so that's exciting!

817
00:50:58,413 --> 00:50:59,280
Really?

818
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,113
Yeah!

819
00:51:00,413 --> 00:51:01,280
Wow!

820
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:05,013
Yeah, I've been like kind of trying to get something going for a while, but it finally worked out!

821
00:51:05,013 --> 00:51:06,980
But now finally you're ready!

822
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,346
Like, I was gonna like honestly invite you earlier, but you know, it took you a while to...

823
00:51:10,346 --> 00:51:11,446
...become this!

824
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:13,446
I feel... I feel too honored for this!

825
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:15,213
I feel like I'm too small for this position!

826
00:51:15,213 --> 00:51:19,546
I feel... (whining sounds)

827
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,646
Okay, okay. So anyway...

828
00:51:24,113 --> 00:51:26,646
This was a special time, but so...

829
00:51:27,613 --> 00:51:30,013
...fact is, fact of the matter is, you are a maid!

830
00:51:30,013 --> 00:51:30,880
Yes!

831
00:51:31,513 --> 00:51:35,413
And you have to like kind of pay for this exposure I've given you!

832
00:51:35,413 --> 00:51:36,780
Oh! Uh...

833
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,446
So I would like you to clean the stage, please, 'cause there's dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt!

834
00:51:41,846 --> 00:51:43,680
Oh! Oh! Get rid of it!

835
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,813
Where did this come from?

836
00:51:45,113 --> 00:51:46,680
You're a maid, right? Clean it up!

837
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,780
Uh, I have no materials! I'll just use my hands!

838
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:54,080
(grunting sounds of cleaning)

839
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,313
Why is it not going away?

840
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,813
(more grunting/struggling sounds)

841
00:51:58,813 --> 00:51:59,913
You're so bad at this!

842
00:51:59,913 --> 00:52:01,713
I'm sorry, お嬢様! Goddammit!
I'm sorry, mistress! Goddammit!

843
00:52:01,713 --> 00:52:03,646
Let me kiss your feet!

844
00:52:03,646 --> 00:52:05,180
You better!

845
00:52:05,313 --> 00:52:07,480
All the KFP are crying right now!

846
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,246
Get to work!

847
00:52:09,246 --> 00:52:11,513
(kissing sounds)

848
00:52:11,846 --> 00:52:13,680
It's not going away!

849
00:52:13,846 --> 00:52:16,880
Mamma mia! Oh my god! Can you not do anything right?

850
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:21,446
I'm sorry, お嬢様! Please forgive me! Don't kick me out!
I'm sorry, mistress! Please forgive me! Don't kick me out!

851
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,780
No! I will not forgive you! I will show you how it's done!

852
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,813
Okay!

853
00:52:24,813 --> 00:52:26,013
Yeah!

854
00:52:26,013 --> 00:52:27,046
Okay!

855
00:52:27,213 --> 00:52:29,913
(screams and starts chasing Cecilia with a frying pan)

856
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:32,480
You know what? I am going to get you!

857
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:44,080
(Kiara chasing Cecilia, both screaming)

858
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,580
Turn it up to the top, let's get it started go non-stop

859
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,480
Bust through the door, we don't knock (it's time to go non-stop)

860
00:53:19,546 --> 00:53:22,580
Like we never cared about what they say, tear up the place like it's our own

861
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,813
Wilder than a cyclone and leave it on a high note

862
00:53:27,546 --> 00:53:31,013
And it's just like magic, lighting up the sky, yeah

863
00:53:31,013 --> 00:53:34,480
When we're together we don't have to try

864
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,846
If you wanna join then this is your invite

865
00:53:37,846 --> 00:53:41,580
Show what you got, come on don't be shy

866
00:53:42,313 --> 00:53:45,513
We, we are breaking through borders

867
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:48,946
Free, like the clouds are beneath us

868
00:53:48,946 --> 00:53:52,446
Oh we, we're like diamonds in starlight

869
00:53:52,446 --> 00:53:56,580
We shine in the dark night 'cause we are the highlight

870
00:53:56,946 --> 00:54:00,746
We, we're just living this moment

871
00:54:00,746 --> 00:54:04,313
Free, on this path that we've chosen

872
00:54:04,313 --> 00:54:08,380
Oh we, we're like diamonds in starlight

873
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:12,246
We shine in the dark night 'cause we are the highlight

874
00:54:12,446 --> 00:54:15,213
Hands up above our heads, it's time to make it pop (la la la)

875
00:54:15,213 --> 00:54:19,146
Keep this belief until we lose control, it's in your blood

876
00:54:19,546 --> 00:54:22,480
You know there ain't no pomp or body getting down like we do

877
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:26,313
There ain't no pomp or body like a party with me, go

878
00:54:27,046 --> 00:54:30,480
And it's just like magic, lighting up the sky, yeah

879
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,080
When we're together we don't have to try

880
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,480
If you wanna join then this is your invite

881
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,413
Show what you got, come on don't be shy

882
00:54:41,413 --> 00:54:44,946
We, we are breaking through borders

883
00:54:44,946 --> 00:54:48,480
Free, like the clouds are beneath us

884
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,980
Oh we, we're like diamonds in starlight

885
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:56,013
We shine in the dark night 'cause we are the highlight

886
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,080
We, we're just living this moment

887
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,588
Free, on this path that we've chosen and we...

888
00:55:04,588 --> 00:55:06,588
We're like diamonds in starlight,

889
00:55:07,088 --> 00:55:08,588
we shine in the dark night

890
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:11,088
'cause we are the highlight.

891
00:55:22,088 --> 00:55:24,088
Don't lose your dream, make it reality, baby

892
00:55:24,588 --> 00:55:27,588
don't lose your dream, make it...

893
00:55:28,088 --> 00:55:29,588
Now everybody let me hear you say!

894
00:55:30,088 --> 00:55:32,088
Don't lose your dream, go and make it for real, baby

895
00:55:33,088 --> 00:55:34,588
don't lose your dream.

896
00:55:37,088 --> 00:55:38,588
Free,

897
00:55:39,088 --> 00:55:40,588
we are breaking through borders,

898
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,088
free,

899
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:44,588
like nobody can stop us, oh we

900
00:55:45,088 --> 00:55:47,588
are diamonds in starlight,

901
00:55:51,088 --> 00:55:52,088
'cause you know that we are...

902
00:55:52,588 --> 00:55:54,588
We are, we are breaking through borders,

903
00:55:55,088 --> 00:55:56,088
free,

904
00:55:57,088 --> 00:55:58,588
like the stars are beneath us, oh we

905
00:55:59,088 --> 00:56:01,088
are, we're like diamonds in starlight,

906
00:56:02,088 --> 00:56:03,588
we shine in the dark night

907
00:56:04,088 --> 00:56:06,088
'cause we are the highlight.

908
00:56:07,088 --> 00:56:08,088
Free,

909
00:56:08,588 --> 00:56:10,088
we're just living this moment,

910
00:56:10,588 --> 00:56:11,588
free,

911
00:56:12,088 --> 00:56:14,088
on this path that we've chosen and we,

912
00:56:15,088 --> 00:56:16,588
we're like diamonds in starlight,

913
00:56:17,088 --> 00:56:18,588
we shine in the dark night

914
00:56:19,588 --> 00:56:21,088
'cause we are the highlight.

915
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:24,588
Highlight, highlight, highlight, highlight.

916
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,588
Highlight, highlight, highlight, yay!

917
00:57:23,688 --> 00:57:26,588
That was another banger from Kiara and I did it
with all my beloved ID girls.

918
00:57:26,688 --> 00:57:28,588
I love you, I love you ID girls, I love you so much!

919
00:57:34,088 --> 00:57:36,588
Yes, so after this wonderful banger, as you may have
noticed, if you look at the time,

920
00:57:36,688 --> 00:57:39,588
it might be time to end soon and therefore I will
introduce some merchandise to you guys.

921
00:57:39,688 --> 00:57:41,588
It's birthday merchandise time!

922
00:57:47,588 --> 00:57:51,588
ではでは誕生日記念のグッズ出るので紹介したいと思います。
Well then, birthday commemoration goods are coming
out, so I'd like to introduce them.

923
00:57:52,588 --> 00:57:54,088
どうぞ見ていきましょう。
Please, let's take a look.

924
00:57:54,588 --> 00:57:55,588
Let's check it out!

925
00:57:56,088 --> 00:57:57,588
That is the overview.

926
00:57:58,588 --> 00:58:01,088
And now let me show you all of them in detail.

927
00:58:01,188 --> 00:58:03,588
First of all, the tapestry! Ta-da!

928
00:58:08,088 --> 00:58:10,588
As you can tell, I am in a wedding dress!

929
00:58:10,688 --> 00:58:13,088
なんと、なんと私、なんか可愛い服着てますね。
Wha- wha-, I'm wearing some cute clothes,
aren't I?

930
00:58:14,588 --> 00:58:16,588
ああ、恥ずかしい。
Ah, how embarrassing.

931
00:58:17,088 --> 00:58:19,588
Yeah, um, it's about time right? I don't know.

932
00:58:20,588 --> 00:58:25,088
It's a beautiful tapestry, I haven't done a tapestry
in a while so I thought you guys deserved one.

933
00:58:25,588 --> 00:58:29,588
And next, with the same beautiful face and a
different expression perhaps, it will be a little badge.

934
00:58:30,088 --> 00:58:32,588
So if you are a badge collector, now's the time!

935
00:58:33,088 --> 00:58:37,088
If you have an itabag or something to fill up, now's
the time to get yourself a wawa badge, a wawawaifu badge!

936
00:58:37,588 --> 00:58:40,088
Oh, and by the way, the illustration is by DOTORI.

937
00:58:41,088 --> 00:58:43,088
Thank you so much, it's so beautiful, I look so cute.

938
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:48,088
バッジ集めてる人もぜひ今回、どうぞいっぱい買ってください。
Those who collect badges too, please do buy
many this time.

939
00:58:48,588 --> 00:58:51,588
ありがとうございます。
Thank you very much.

940
00:58:55,088 --> 00:58:57,588
And next up is the lamp! Yeah!

941
00:58:58,088 --> 00:59:01,088
The title is: "You Light Up My Life Lamp".

942
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:05,588
You! Because it's a chicken, it's a KFP chicken!

943
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:12,088
はい、私の人生を照らしてくれるのがあなたなので、その姿をしたランプでございます。
Yes, because you are the one who lights up
my life, it's a lamp in that form.

944
00:59:13,088 --> 00:59:16,588
And next we have the "Anger Management Frog Ball"!
Froggy wawa!

945
00:59:17,088 --> 00:59:19,588
Perfect right? You want to squeeze it and squish
her head, don't you? Me too!

946
00:59:20,088 --> 00:59:23,088
おこ、おこ、おこマネジメント、え、カエルボールでございます。
Oko-, oko-, oko- management, uh, frog ball.

947
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:27,588
フロギーわわの顔付いてるボールです。とてもキュートですけど、
It's a ball with Froggy Wawa's face on it.
It's very cute, but...

948
00:59:28,088 --> 00:59:31,088
何かね、押したいんだよね、うん。
you know, you want to press it, yeah.

949
00:59:33,588 --> 00:59:36,588
And next we have a situational voice! Yes!

950
00:59:37,088 --> 00:59:39,588
It is matching with the tapestry actually.

951
00:59:40,088 --> 00:59:44,088
So this, it fits you know, like this whole
honeymoon wedding situation.

952
00:59:45,088 --> 00:59:49,588
I normally don't really go that hard on the romance in my
voice packs so it's a very big... just this time, just this once.

953
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:00,996
ちょっとだけ...
Just a little...

954
01:00:01,096 --> 01:00:02,596
えー、ちょっと恥ずかしい、
Um, it's a bit embarrassing,

955
01:00:02,696 --> 01:00:04,596
ロマンチックなシチュエーションです。
it's a romantic situation.

956
01:00:04,696 --> 01:00:06,596
