00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:40,016
Let me take you through the stage a little bit.

159
00:12:40,016 --> 00:12:44,016
This is our new stage. It looks so luxurious and beautiful.

160
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:48,016
Wow, so shiny, I know.

161
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:53,016
Well, we also have a very, or I have a very special surprise

162
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:56,016
for you guys at the end of this live.

163
00:12:56,016 --> 00:12:59,016
The last song... hmm, what could it be?

164
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:04,016
It will still stay a surprise, but please still stay until the very end.

165
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:09,016
And we have many guests too, that you may already have seen or heard about.

166
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:11,516
So look forward to them!

167
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:14,016
Yeah! The next song will be a cover song from KIRA,

168
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:17,016
my song even though, you know, similar vibe to my original songs.

169
00:13:17,016 --> 00:13:19,516
So please enjoy, NICE TYPE!

170
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:26,516
NICE TYPE
Lyrics: Asteroid Music Team (monii, KIRA)
Music: Asteroid Music Team (KIRA, monii, Johnny R)

171
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,416
It's getting dark, better watch your back

172
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:32,116
Better pay attention now

173
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:34,816
A demon on the loose, I'm c-c-cowering for you now

174
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,616
Watching and teasing, make it so easy

175
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,516
To set you at ease, listen

176
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:43,016
But baby, why don't you give in?

177
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:45,916
Feeling, you want it, I need it, go get it

178
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:48,716
Dreaming, believe it, take control

179
00:13:48,816 --> 00:13:52,316
You're just so easy, I'm stuck, I'm greedy

180
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,716
Satisfy the hunger, got you lo-lo-locked down

181
00:13:55,816 --> 00:13:59,916
Still begging for more, sinister allure

182
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:04,116
Look what you got yourself into after all

183
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:07,416
Watch it escalate, no more rotate

184
00:14:07,516 --> 00:14:10,016
Voyeur, boy, try if you want

185
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,516
I'll let you come inside my mind

186
00:14:12,616 --> 00:14:15,216
Hold it down and let's go all night

187
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:17,216
Oh you look so nervous, what's wrong?

188
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:18,716
Don't be polite

189
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,216
Got you on your knees

190
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:21,816
I never claimed to be the nice type

191
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:29,316
I'm touching now, innocent to you

192
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,416
You're looking for the helper, ain't no use

193
00:14:32,516 --> 00:14:34,316
Boy, you should have known

194
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,616
Once I'm done, I'm moving on

195
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:39,716
One look into my eyes and you're gonna fall

196
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:44,116
You're mine forever but I ain't yours, no

197
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,716
It only takes a minute to get you all addicted

198
00:14:47,816 --> 00:14:51,216
Can never get enough, no no no

199
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:55,216
Still begging for more, sinister allure

200
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:58,916
Look what you got yourself into after all

201
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:00,016
Watch it escalate, no more...

202
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:04,924
Try if you want, I'll let you come inside my mind

203
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:08,524
Call it down, and let's go all night

204
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:12,324
Oh you look so nervous, what's wrong? Don't be polite

205
00:15:12,724 --> 00:15:16,424
Got you on your knees, I never claimed to be the nice type

206
00:15:18,224 --> 00:15:20,324
I'm not the nice type, nah

207
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:23,524
Got you like that, oh

208
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,524
I'm not the nice type, nah

209
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:30,524
Never claimed to be the nice type

210
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:48,824
I miss you

211
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:53,524
Didn't want to admit it if I do

212
00:15:54,224 --> 00:15:56,824
Always been close but far away

213
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,524
You go but then you stay

214
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:02,524
It's always been you

215
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:05,524
I guess we are different after all

216
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:09,824
But it's shocking how far apart we grew

217
00:16:10,524 --> 00:16:13,124
So I cut all the ties to play it safe

218
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:16,224
But you like playing games

219
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:19,024
It's always been you

220
00:16:19,424 --> 00:16:22,024
And somehow you're still here

221
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,824
This feeling could kill me

222
00:16:26,324 --> 00:16:29,024
Somehow you're still here

223
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:34,524
And this might take me out, take me down, take me apart

224
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:38,224
Oh I got it bad, got attached,

225
00:16:38,324 --> 00:16:42,524
my imagination brings me right back to you

226
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:46,824
Always wanted all, when I fall, I fall hard

227
00:16:47,324 --> 00:16:52,824
Oh baby tell me why, tell me why, tell me why does a heart break

228
00:16:53,324 --> 00:16:57,524
A heart break, a heart...

229
00:16:58,224 --> 00:17:01,824
Tell me why does a heart break, a heart break

230
00:17:02,324 --> 00:17:06,324
Oh baby tell me why, tell me why

231
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:11,824
It's kind of painful, to tell the truth

232
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:16,224
I should cry it out, but I don't usually do

233
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:20,524
Some things don't change though, I'd make them if I could

234
00:17:21,024 --> 00:17:24,824
Cause I don't feel human, I wonder if you would

235
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:28,424
And it's not even fair, that you're happy with her

236
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:32,624
And you're so unaware, maybe that's why it hurts

237
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:39,524
The world stops and the clock keeps ticking, oh no...

238
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:44,224
Oh I got it bad, got attached,

239
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:48,524
my imagination brings me right back to you

240
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:52,824
Always wanted all, when I fall, I fall hard

241
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:58,824
Oh baby tell me why, tell me why, tell me why does a heart break

242
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:02,524
Why won't you let me go

243
00:18:02,924 --> 00:18:05,524
I really want to be alone

244
00:18:06,124 --> 00:18:09,524
Right now, delete my number from your phone

245
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:12,524
I want to be alone

246
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:16,824
But somehow you're still here

247
00:18:17,324 --> 00:18:23,524
Oh yeah, somehow you're still here, ah-ah-ah

248
00:18:24,124 --> 00:18:28,524
And this might take me out, take me down, take me apart

249
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:32,424
Oh I got it bad, got attached,

250
00:18:32,524 --> 00:18:36,824
my imagination brings me right back to you

251
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:41,124
Always wanted all, when I fall, I fall hard

252
00:18:41,524 --> 00:18:46,524
Oh baby tell me why, tell me why, tell me why does a heart break

253
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:50,424
Oh I got it bad, got attached,

254
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:54,424
my imagination brings me right back to you

255
00:18:54,824 --> 00:18:58,624
Always wanted all, when I fall, I fall hard

256
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:03,824
Oh baby tell me why, tell me why, tell me why does a heart break

257
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:08,424
A heart break, a heart...

258
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:12,524
Tell me why does a heart break, a heart break

259
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:16,524
Oh baby tell me why, tell me why

260
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:25,524
Hoo-hoo-hoo...

261
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:30,524
Oh baby tell me why, tell me why

262
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:40,524
Yay!

263
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:42,524
We can't wait to talk!

264
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:44,024
I know, right?

265
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,824
Yay!

266
00:19:46,024 --> 00:19:48,224
IRyS! IRyS! IRyS!

267
00:19:48,324 --> 00:19:49,824
Thank you so much for inviting me!

268
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:51,424
Of course! It's such a rare duo!

269
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,324
I know, right? We had to do it!

270
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:54,524
I think this is the first time...

271
00:19:54,524 --> 00:19:55,324
Yeah!

272
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:57,124
That we sang and danced together, like just the two of us!

273
00:19:57,124 --> 00:19:58,224
Did you like it?

274
00:19:58,224 --> 00:19:59,524
Did you guys like it?

275
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:00,024
Thank you!

276
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,032
Introduce yourself then.

277
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:05,332
Hi-RyS, it's IRyS from Hololive English Promise.

278
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:06,032
Yeah.

279
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:09,132
I and I am just so, so happy.

280
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:10,132
Me too!

281
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:13,132
I think I've been in Hololive for like over three years...

282
00:20:13,232 --> 00:20:15,532
...and I just can't believe this is our first time.

283
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:16,432
Yeah!

284
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:17,932
Sorry to keep you waiting.

285
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:20,332
Yeah, no, I know. It's very special, so...

286
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:23,232
Yeah, and it was a really special song, too, right?

287
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:24,732
Yeah, "Why Does the Heartbreak", right?

288
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,532
Yeah, why does the heartbreak, IRyS?

289
00:20:26,632 --> 00:20:27,432
Tell me.

290
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:30,932
I mean, technically I've never been heartbroken ever in my life.

291
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:32,132
Oh really?

292
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,232
What about me?

293
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,932
Well, I mean, I might have broken her heart...

294
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:38,232
...but I've never been broken.

295
00:20:38,332 --> 00:20:39,132
Oh really?

296
00:20:39,232 --> 00:20:42,532
Well, I mean, honestly, when we were doing this dance move...

297
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:44,232
...this one...

298
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:46,532
...I was like... (sniffs)

299
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:47,332
Oh?

300
00:20:47,432 --> 00:20:49,132
I smelled Bae on you!

301
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:50,132
Liar!

302
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:51,132
No!

303
00:20:51,232 --> 00:20:52,532
What are you...? Liar!

304
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:53,632
No, no!

305
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:55,332
I was alone last night. What you talkin' about?

306
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:57,132
She's lying, she's lying!

307
00:20:57,232 --> 00:20:58,332
She's a fat liar!

308
00:20:58,432 --> 00:21:00,032
Maybe it was the night before?

309
00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:01,332
Or before?

310
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:04,132
No, no, no! If you see... I wash my hair every day!

311
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:05,432
Ah...

312
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:08,532
It's more like your whole body exudes...

313
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:09,532
Okay...

314
00:21:09,632 --> 00:21:10,532
Well...

315
00:21:11,132 --> 00:21:13,232
Well, let me let me take a sniff at your hair.

316
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:14,332
You know.

317
00:21:14,432 --> 00:21:16,532
(Sniffing sound)

318
00:21:16,632 --> 00:21:17,532
Hmm, smells nice.

319
00:21:17,632 --> 00:21:21,032
It smells a little bit like a nice-smelling crow.

320
00:21:21,132 --> 00:21:22,532
Oh, crow?

321
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:24,032
Maybe like Kronii? No, no, no, Kronii's not a crow.

322
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:26,532
No, I'm thinking of someone like the Nerizzler.

323
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:27,432
Nerizzler!

324
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:29,532
Nerizzler! Well, I mean, okay, honestly, that could be.

325
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:31,032
Because...

326
00:21:31,132 --> 00:21:33,932
...me and Nerissa, I thought we had, you know, something.

327
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:35,432
Because she...

328
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:38,232
I felt like she chose me.

329
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:39,132
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

330
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:40,532
You do have something.

331
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,532
Thank you.

332
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:45,032
But I got a little bit confused because a while ago at the New Year concert...

333
00:21:45,132 --> 00:21:46,332
...she was kissed.

334
00:21:46,432 --> 00:21:49,032
Okay, she didn't kiss her, she was kissed by Shiori.

335
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:50,032
Uh-huh.

336
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:52,532
So now I'm really confused because I know she loves Shiori...

337
00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:55,432
...and I'm like, where do I stand with her? I'm so confused.

338
00:21:55,532 --> 00:21:57,032
I mean...

339
00:21:57,132 --> 00:22:00,932
...no, you guys just take your relationship...

340
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:04,132
...especially when it comes to kissing and stuff, more personal, not in public.

341
00:22:04,232 --> 00:22:05,132
I'm assuming, right?

342
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:06,132
I don't really know about that.

343
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:07,532
Did you guys like... did you guys like take a shower together?

344
00:22:07,632 --> 00:22:09,132
No, no!

345
00:22:09,232 --> 00:22:10,132
Huh?

346
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:12,432
Well, okay, we were in swimsuits.

347
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,032
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

348
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,032
Anyway, I think I'll clear it up with her...

349
00:22:16,132 --> 00:22:18,532
...because the song after this... Hmm, I think I sense her presence.

350
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:19,432
Oh?

351
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:22,032
Yeah, maybe you should talk to her a bit if you're worried.

352
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,032
You know, she's the Nerizzler though, so you know...

353
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:26,232
...I'm sure she's gone on a like couple dates.

354
00:22:26,332 --> 00:22:27,432
Ah!

355
00:22:27,532 --> 00:22:29,332
No, no, not a couple dates. It's just a group of friends.

356
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,332
What you talking about?

357
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,932
It's just a group of friends.

358
00:22:32,032 --> 00:22:33,232
Well then...

359
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:35,332
...are you guys ready for the next song?

360
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:37,532
I am so excited to see that!

361
00:22:37,632 --> 00:22:38,232
Thank you!

362
00:22:38,332 --> 00:22:40,232
Alright, you watch on the sidelines.

363
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:41,332
Yes.

364
00:22:41,432 --> 00:22:43,032
See you guys!

365
00:22:43,132 --> 00:22:44,232

372
00:23:07,632 --> 00:23:11,532
I don't want the handbags, the money, or the diamond rings

373
00:23:11,632 --> 00:23:14,532

00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:30,048
Hey!

489
00:30:30,248 --> 00:30:34,348
Wooo! Yatta! Dekimashita! "Beat Eater"!
Wooo! We did it! We performed "Beat Eater"!

490
00:30:34,548 --> 00:30:36,048
Yeah!

491
00:30:37,048 --> 00:30:39,048
Iroha-chan, welcome!

492
00:30:39,248 --> 00:30:41,248
Introduction, please!

493
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,048
Hello! My name is Iroha Kazama.

494
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:48,048
Japanese Hololive 6th generation HoloX.

495
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:50,048
よろしくお願いします！
Nice to meet you!

496
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:54,048
Welcome! Yatta! Iroha-chan!
Welcome! We did it! Iroha-chan!

497
00:30:54,048 --> 00:30:56,548
We sang Beat Eater together.

498
00:30:56,548 --> 00:31:00,048
I'm so happy because I really, really love this song.

499
00:31:00,248 --> 00:31:05,348
And when I chose it, I thought I need someone who can dance really well,

500
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:07,548
which is Iroha-chan.

501
00:31:08,548 --> 00:31:14,048
But then after I already chose you, I realized when I was looking up "Beat Eater" on YouTube...

502
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:18,048
I found your cover! I was like, eh? She sang this already?!

503
00:31:18,248 --> 00:31:20,048
もうカバーしてる！
You've already covered it!

504
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:22,848
Yes, そうです！　だから今回誘ってもらえて...
Yes, that's right! So being invited this time...

505
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:27,248
...とってもとっても嬉しくて。"Beat Eater" so very, very pop and cool song.
...I'm very, very happy. "Beat Eater" is such a pop and cool song.

506
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:30,248
I love it! So thank you today!

507
00:31:30,548 --> 00:31:31,548
Yes, thank you!

508
00:31:31,548 --> 00:31:35,048
ありがとう！ Live guest, thank you ありがとうございます！
Thank you! Live guest, thank you, thank you very much!

509
00:31:35,248 --> 00:31:39,048
Well, it was a very like dance-focused song, so I wonder what dance move was difficult for you?

510
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:44,848
やっぱり、サビ。
As expected, the chorus.

511
00:31:44,848 --> 00:31:45,348
サビ？
The chorus?

512
00:31:45,548 --> 00:31:48,048
Tu-tu-tu-tu-tu... そこ！
Tu-tu-tu-tu-tu... There!

513
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:49,248
Beat Eater...

514
00:31:49,548 --> 00:31:52,348
So waving, so very, very difficult.

515
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:56,348
Actually I also just like today I finally understood.

516
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:59,548
今日やっと把握できたと思う。
I think I finally got the hang of it today.

517
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:03,548
で、rehearsal together, lesson... mm?
And we rehearsed together, had lessons... mm?

518
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,848
Hm? This way? Hm?

519
00:32:06,048 --> 00:32:08,048
Yeah, ってことでやりましたもんね。
Yeah, so we did it together.

520
00:32:08,548 --> 00:32:11,848
For me, there's like, you know when I overthink?

521
00:32:12,048 --> 00:32:16,248
Overthinking, then I like forget how to do the simplest things...

522
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:18,548
...even though I know that I know it.

523
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:22,248
So there was this one move... you like step forward...

524
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:26,548
...and when you step, you like kick the other leg back, right?

525
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:29,848
And then you put it to the front and we add the hand, right?

526
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:35,248
So it's like this, but I overthink and I like stumble over my legs...

527
00:32:35,548 --> 00:32:42,048
Step, kick, wave, more, more resource...

528
00:32:42,248 --> 00:32:45,848
So I had to do it a hundred times so that I stop overthinking.

529
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:48,848
Oh my god! But Kiara-senpai practicing so hard!

530
00:32:49,048 --> 00:32:51,348
Iroha-chan too!

531
00:32:51,548 --> 00:32:54,048
So together, practice together very fun! Yes!
So together, practicing together was very fun! Yes!

532
00:32:54,548 --> 00:32:57,048
ありがとうございました！　楽しかった！
Thank you very much! It was fun!

533
00:32:57,248 --> 00:32:59,248
本当に楽しかった！　ありがとうございました！
It was really fun! Thank you very much!

534
00:32:59,548 --> 00:33:00,848
Let's do it again sometime.

535
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:05,248
Yes! So singing and dancing, so together, yes!

536
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:08,248
Also Iroha-chan, very nice English!

537
00:33:08,548 --> 00:33:11,248
No, no, zako zako English! No nice English!
No, no, pathetic English! Not nice English!

538
00:33:11,548 --> 00:33:13,248
マジ助かる、助かる。
It really helps, it helps.

539
00:33:13,548 --> 00:33:16,848
More English practice hard, 頑張ります！
I'll practice English harder and do my best!

540
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:19,848
Okay! So with that we move on to the next song...

541
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:22,248
...and the next guest! Who could it be?

542
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:28,048
Bye-bye guys! See you next song! Bye-bye next guest! Yeah!

543
00:33:43,448 --> 00:33:45,348
い〜やい〜やい〜や
Ya ya ya ya

544
00:33:43,548 --> 00:33:50,048
い〜やい〜やい〜や
(Whatever, whatever, whatever)
Lyrics, Music: Neru & z'5
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Lyrics, Music: Neru & z'5

545
00:33:45,448 --> 00:33:47,348
い〜やい〜やい〜や
Whatever, whatever, whatever

546
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:50,748
くたばってる頭脳　ぽしゃった
My brain is exhausted and failed

547
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:53,348
この怠惰が憎いな
I hate this laziness

548
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:57,348
またこうしてベッドで　また寝腐っている
Lying in bed and rotting away again like this

549
00:33:57,448 --> 00:33:59,748
ここ最近　調子悪いな
I've been out of sorts lately

550
00:33:59,848 --> 00:34:02,148
いや　本気はまたまた
No, I'm still not serious

551
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,148
そう言ったのはこれで何度目のセリフだろう
I wonder how many times I've said that phrase by now

552
00:34:05,448 --> 00:34:08,348
無造作な部屋　一人の両目
A messy room, one pair of eyes

553
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:12,148
隠れ際　机の下で
Hiding under the table

554
00:34:12,448 --> 00:34:15,348
午前二時もせぬ　身なりは三流
Not even 2 AM, my appearance is low-class

555
00:34:15,448 --> 00:34:19,148
お涙はどうぞ頂戴
Please give me some tears

556
00:34:22,448 --> 00:34:25,748
僕らどうせ聖者じゃないさ
We're not saints anyway

557
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:33,148
だから終止でいいや
So a full stop is fine

558
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:39,148
ノー・サンキューさ　い〜やい〜やい〜や

クリンゼ　一生ナンセンスだっていいや

ノー・サンキューさ　い〜やい〜やい〜や
No thank you, whatever, whatever, whatever

561
00:34:46,248 --> 00:34:50,148
最低で結構　堂々食っていいや
Lowest is fine, it's okay to be unashamedly proud

562
00:34:50,448 --> 00:34:52,348
よ、センチメンタル相まって
Mixed with sentimentality

563
00:34:52,448 --> 00:34:54,348
一年中のボケ数も
And year-round foolishness

564
00:34:54,448 --> 00:34:57,348
140文字のポエムに放っている
Unleashing it in a 140-character poem

565
00:34:57,448 --> 00:35:00,048
これ外にパッと決まったなら
If this was suddenly decided outside...

566
00:35:00,496 --> 00:35:02,316
いーないーな　もっと当然
It's fine, it's fine, it's only natural

567
00:35:02,316 --> 00:35:05,596
逃げ足だけが　特得の芸
My only skill is running away

568
00:35:05,596 --> 00:35:07,436
エッサホイサ　待つの身
Heave-ho, heave-ho, I'm just waiting

569
00:35:07,436 --> 00:35:09,236
口だけで　ちゃちゃ
Just talk, talk, talk

570
00:35:09,236 --> 00:35:12,676
獲物には　速攻　ダイブ　そう
Diving headfirst for the prey, yeah

571
00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:20,716
嘘も　方便　だって　言うさ
They say lies are sometimes necessary

572
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:27,296
だから　同情　なんて　いや
So I don't want any sympathy

573
00:35:27,756 --> 00:35:30,916
ノー天気スタイル　いーや　いーや　いーや
Carefree style, whatever, whatever, whatever

574
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:34,676
ご臨終　一生　ポンコツ　だって　いーや
I'm a failure for life, and I don't care

00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:37,876
ノー天気スタイル　いーや　いーや　いーや
Carefree style, whatever, whatever, whatever

576
00:35:37,876 --> 00:35:41,596
最低で　結構　ハッピー　だって　いーや
I'm at rock bottom, but I'm happy, so whatever

577
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:44,876
ハラ減ったら　ヤル気が失せた
When I'm hungry, I lose all motivation

578
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,596
また　スマホ　いじった
And start messing with my phone again

579
00:35:46,596 --> 00:35:50,116
ただ　こうして　ベッドで　死んだフリを　してる
Just lying in bed like this, pretending to be dead

580
00:35:50,116 --> 00:35:51,916
言葉たら　絵空　口だ
Empty words and pipedreams

581
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,716
なら　どうして　そうしない？
Then why don't you do it?

582
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:57,196
そりゃ　ボッチで　デブっちの　ヘタレ　だから　だろう
Because I'm a lonely, chubby coward, that's why

583
00:35:58,316 --> 00:36:00,116
また　妄想の　エッチが　バズった
Another dirty delusion went viral

584
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,916
まあ正直　テラった
To be honest, it was amazing

585
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:05,396
ただ　こうして　ベッドで　僕は　腐っている
Just rotting away in bed like this

586
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,276
ここ最近　調子は悪いが
I haven't been doing well lately

587
00:36:07,276 --> 00:36:09,036
いや本気は　まだまだ
But I haven't even gotten serious yet

588
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:12,516
もー　どうにでも　なってくれ　お釈迦様
Oh, just let whatever happen, Lord Buddha

589
00:36:12,516 --> 00:36:15,716
ノー天気スタイル　いーや　いーや　いーや
Carefree style, whatever, whatever, whatever

590
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:19,516
ご臨終　一生　プライド　だって　いーや
Dead for life, I don't care about pride

591
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:22,636
ノー天気スタイル　いーや　いーや　いーや
Carefree style, whatever, whatever, whatever

592
00:36:22,636 --> 00:36:26,396
最低で　結構　ノーナシ　だって　いーや
I'm the worst, and I'm incompetent, so whatever

593
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:30,276
ノー天気スタイル！
Carefree style!

594
00:36:31,116 --> 00:36:34,356
明日も　頑張って　と　いーな
I hope I can do my best tomorrow too

595
00:36:34,356 --> 00:36:37,436
ノー天気スタイル！
Carefree style!

596
00:36:38,316 --> 00:36:42,116
だから　今日　まくら　だって　いーや
So for today, even a pillow is fine

597
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:05,256
(Coughing) Good morning!

598
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:06,906
We're on stage!

599
00:37:06,906 --> 00:37:08,556
Five more minutes...

600
00:37:08,556 --> 00:37:10,556
Why did we fall asleep?

601
00:37:10,556 --> 00:37:12,806
Oh, such a chill song, though.

602
00:37:16,856 --> 00:37:18,556
How are you? Hello!

603
00:37:18,556 --> 00:37:22,056
Maybe you should introduce yourself?

604
00:37:22,056 --> 00:37:23,056
Myself? Oh, hi!

605
00:37:23,056 --> 00:37:27,556
I'm Ninomae Ina'nis from Hololive English Myth. Hello!

606
00:37:27,556 --> 00:37:31,056
Yeah, okay, I know it's comfortable on the floor. You love the floor.

607
00:37:31,056 --> 00:37:32,556
Five more minutes.

608
00:37:32,556 --> 00:37:36,056
Special floor, right? Floor rating?

609
00:37:36,056 --> 00:37:38,056
The floor... A solid 8.37.

610
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,556
Oh, that's pretty good!

611
00:37:40,556 --> 00:37:43,056
But we gotta leave the floor now.

612
00:37:43,056 --> 00:37:44,056
Yeah.

613
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:48,056
Guys, it's been so long since we released this as a song cover!

614
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:51,556
And now we finally, upon popular demand...

615
00:37:51,556 --> 00:37:52,556
Performed it!

616
00:37:52,556 --> 00:37:55,556
Yeah! How long has it been? Like, three years?

617
00:37:55,556 --> 00:37:58,056
Three years. Unbelievable.

618
00:37:58,056 --> 00:38:02,556
Yeah. Have you guys listened to it before? Or are you a newcomer and you never heard it before?

619
00:38:02,556 --> 00:38:05,456
In that case, what should they do, Ina?

620
00:38:05,456 --> 00:38:06,556
Listen to it.

621
00:38:06,556 --> 00:38:08,556
Listen to it! Yeah, it's like pretty far down.

622
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:12,756
So you gotta go to the videos and to "Most Popular", because it's really popular!

623
00:38:12,756 --> 00:38:15,556
Yeah! Thank you Takotori!

624
00:38:15,556 --> 00:38:17,556
Yeah, Takotori!

625
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:19,556
Thank you for giving us love.

626
00:38:19,556 --> 00:38:21,556
And thanks for inviting me!

627
00:38:21,556 --> 00:38:25,056
Oh, of course Ina! It's so fun with you!

628
00:38:25,056 --> 00:38:27,556
Oh yeah, we had that, you know, this special dance...

629
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:30,556
Yeah, speaking of fun, we have this... guys, dance with us!

630
00:38:30,556 --> 00:38:35,056
(Humming)

631
00:38:35,056 --> 00:38:36,756
We're like robots.

632
00:38:36,756 --> 00:38:38,256
No-tenki style.

633
00:38:38,256 --> 00:38:41,056
Yeah, robots, kind of.

634
00:38:41,056 --> 00:38:43,756
But it's like, ah, whatever, whatever, whatever.

635
00:38:43,756 --> 00:38:45,056
Yeah, that's fine.

636
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:49,056
So, actually, this stage is like pretty like epic and godlike, isn't it?

637
00:38:49,056 --> 00:38:51,556
Oh, I feel like a goddess!

638
00:38:51,556 --> 00:38:56,056
So far the songs haven't quite fit the theme...

639
00:38:56,056 --> 00:39:00,056
...but now in the second part of this, there's gonna be more guests, more songs...

640
00:39:00,056 --> 00:39:04,056
...and they're all gonna fit the vibe more. They're gonna be godlike and epic! Yes!

641
00:39:04,056 --> 00:39:06,556
Godlike. Epic. Yes.

642
00:39:06,556 --> 00:39:08,056
So I'm kind of nervous!

643
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:12,556
Eh, you can't wait? Well, can you give me some kind of motivation call, please, Ina?

644
00:39:12,556 --> 00:39:15,056
Iya, iya, iya...

645
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:18,056
(Laughs) Oh, come on! Not "whatever, whatever"!

646
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,556
Okay, okay. Well, just this time, okay?

647
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:21,056
Okay, okay.

648
00:39:21,056 --> 00:39:25,556
You're gonna join me on the "Oh!", everyone will join me on the "Oh!", okay?

649
00:39:25,556 --> 00:39:28,056
On the "Oh!"? Okay, sounds good.

650
00:39:28,056 --> 00:39:29,556
Here we go.

651
00:39:29,556 --> 00:39:31,556
Takanashi Kiara! Fight!

652
00:39:31,556 --> 00:39:32,256
Oh!

653
00:39:32,256 --> 00:39:33,256
Fight!

654
00:39:33,256 --> 00:39:34,256
Oh!

655
00:39:34,256 --> 00:39:36,556
Fight! Oh!

656
00:39:36,556 --> 00:39:39,056
Never heard that before. Okay, okay!

657
00:39:39,056 --> 00:39:41,556
Thank you! Bye-bye!

658
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:42,556
Bye-bye!

659

STYX HELIX
Lyrics, Music: MYTH & ROID

661
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,464
Oh, please don't let me die

662
00:40:13,564 --> 00:40:15,564
waiting for your touch

663
00:40:19,464 --> 00:40:21,464
No, don't give up on life,

664
00:40:21,564 --> 00:40:23,464
this endless dead end

665
00:40:30,264 --> 00:40:33,464
言葉を吐き出す 命零れ落ちてゆくほどに
Words are spat out, as life spills over

666
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,564
盗まれた 芽生えた想いまでも
Even the stolen, sprouting feelings

667
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:44,264
こんなにあっけなく
So easily

668
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:51,264
消えてしまうの
They disappear

669
00:40:53,664 --> 00:40:54,664
I wish I was there

670
00:40:54,764 --> 00:40:56,564
Oh, please don't let me die

671
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:58,264
waiting for your touch

672
00:40:58,364 --> 00:41:02,164
二度と何も失くさないように
So that I won't lose anything again

673
00:41:02,264 --> 00:41:04,564
私を忘れて
Forget about me

674
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:08,164
始めて Restart
And begin, Restart

675
00:41:09,664 --> 00:41:11,564
No, don't give up on life,

676
00:41:11,664 --> 00:41:13,464
this endless dead end

677
00:41:13,564 --> 00:41:17,664
君を砕くこの悲しみが
May this sadness that breaks you

678
00:41:17,764 --> 00:41:21,564
いつか終わりますように
One day come to an end

679
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,264
For now, adieu

680
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:31,264
My time is spinning around

681
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:34,964
Your deep black eyes

682
00:41:35,464 --> 00:41:39,164
I forgot what time it is

683
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:43,064
And our memories are gone

684
00:41:45,364 --> 00:41:49,064
甘い香り放つ 追憶という名の誘惑
A sweet fragrance emitting, temptation of memories

685
00:41:49,164 --> 00:41:52,264
囚われ 飛ばされて 逃れられず また
Captured, blown away, unable to escape, again

686
00:42:03,464 --> 00:42:07,464
溺れてしまうの
I end up drowning

687
00:42:08,964 --> 00:42:10,164
I wish you were here

688
00:42:10,264 --> 00:42:12,164
Oh, never close your eyes

689
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:14,264
searching for true fate

690
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:18,164
何処か消えた あの温もりを
The warmth that disappeared somewhere

691
00:42:18,264 --> 00:42:21,564
追いかけ続けて
Continuing to chase it

692
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,164
見失う Restart
I lose sight, Restart

693
00:42:25,864 --> 00:42:27,764
So, let us try again

694
00:42:27,864 --> 00:42:29,664
from the very first time

695
00:42:29,764 --> 00:42:33,464
きっと きっと そうやって 今も
Surely, surely, even now

696
00:42:33,564 --> 00:42:36,564
虚しい輪を描いている
Drawing an empty circle

697
00:42:36,664 --> 00:42:39,264
For now, adieu again

698
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,264
Fading in

699
00:42:49,364 --> 00:42:51,264
Fading out

700
00:42:51,364 --> 00:42:53,264
Fading in

701
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:55,264
Fading out

702
00:43:11,364 --> 00:43:12,164
I wish you were here

703
00:43:12,264 --> 00:43:16,164
あの日には戻れない
I cannot return to that day

704
00:43:16,264 --> 00:43:18,264
時は強く
Time is strong,

705
00:43:18,364 --> 00:43:20,164
悲しく強く
sadly strong

706
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:24,064
ただただ進んでゆくだけ
Just moving forward

707
00:43:24,164 --> 00:43:26,164
Restart

708
00:43:27,764 --> 00:43:29,564
No, don't give up on life,

709
00:43:29,664 --> 00:43:31,264
this endless dead end

710
00:43:31,364 --> 00:43:36,164
振り返らない そんな強さを
The strength to not look back

711
00:43:36,264 --> 00:43:38,264
誰も皆 持ってる
Everyone has it,

712
00:43:38,364 --> 00:43:40,264
知ってる
everyone knows it

713
00:43:40,364 --> 00:43:42,164
For now, adieu

714
00:43:47,364 --> 00:43:51,264
And we'll start waiting for a new day

715
00:43:51,364 --> 00:43:53,464
二度と...
Never again...

716
00:43:55,764 --> 00:43:59,264
And we'll start waiting for a new day

717
00:43:59,364 --> 00:44:02,164
君と...
With you...

718
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:06,364
Oh, please don't let me die

719
00:44:08,264 --> 00:44:14,264
消えないで
Don't disappear

いつか君が瞳に灯す愛の光が
Someday the light of love you'll ignite in your eyes

722
00:45:17,372 --> 00:45:21,322
時を越えて
Will cross through time

723
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:25,022
滅び急ぐ世界の夢を
And surely break one dream

724
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:29,022
確かに一つ壊すだろう
Of this world racing toward destruction

725
00:45:29,022 --> 00:45:32,472
ためらいを飲み干して
Swallowing down your hesitation

726
00:45:32,472 --> 00:45:36,472
君が望むものは何？
What is it that you desire?

727
00:45:36,472 --> 00:45:40,022
こんな欲深い憧れの
Does a fleeting tomorrow exist

728
00:45:40,022 --> 00:45:43,972
行方に儚い明日はあるの？
In the destination of such greedy yearnings?

729
00:45:44,122 --> 00:45:48,572
子供の頃の夢に見ていた
Like the ancient magic

730
00:45:48,572 --> 00:45:53,022
古の魔法のように
I used to see in my childhood dreams

731
00:45:53,022 --> 00:45:58,022
闇さえ砕く力で
With a power that can crush even the darkness

732
00:45:58,022 --> 00:46:01,022
微笑む君に会いたい
I want to see you smiling

733
00:46:01,122 --> 00:46:05,472
怯えるこの手の中には
Within these trembling hands

734
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:10,022
手折られた花の勇気
Is the courage of a plucked flower

735
00:46:10,022 --> 00:46:13,922
想いだけが頼る全て
My feelings are all I can rely on

736
00:46:13,922 --> 00:46:21,072
光を呼び覚ます願い
A wish to awaken the light

737
00:46:26,572 --> 00:46:31,022
いつか君も誰かのために
Someday you, too, for someone's sake

738
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:34,972
強い力を望むだろう
Will surely desire a strong power

739
00:46:34,972 --> 00:46:39,022
愛が胸を捉えた夜に
On the night when love captures your heart

740
00:46:39,022 --> 00:46:43,372
未知の言葉が生まれて来る
Unknown words will be born

741
00:46:43,372 --> 00:46:47,372
迷わず行けるのなら
If I can go on without hesitation

742
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:50,472
心が砕けてもいい
I don't mind if my heart is shattered

743
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:54,922
いつも目の前の悲しみに
I always want a spell

744
00:46:54,922 --> 00:46:59,022
立ち向かうための呪文が欲しい
To confront the sadness before my eyes

745
00:46:59,122 --> 00:47:03,022
君はまだ夢見る記憶
You are still a dreaming memory

746
00:47:03,022 --> 00:47:07,022
私は眠らない明日
I am a tomorrow that doesn't sleep

747
00:47:07,022 --> 00:47:11,522

As we move forward

To win the miracle of our meeting

My feelings are all that live

752
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:35,072

A wish I brandish in my heart

Where the trapped sun shines

755
00:48:40,022 --> 00:48:44,972
不思議の国の本が好きだった頃
Back when I loved books about Wonderland

756
00:48:44,972 --> 00:48:50,022
（ハ・ヤ・イ・ヨ...）
(Ha-ya-i-yo...)

757
00:48:50,022 --> 00:48:55,022
願いはきっと叶うと教える
I believed in fairy tales

758
00:48:55,022 --> 00:49:02,072
お伽話を信じた
That told me wishes will surely come true

759
00:49:09,222 --> 00:49:13,972
静かに咲き乱れていた
The ancient magic was blooming silently

760
00:49:13,972 --> 00:49:18,472
古の魔法優しく
Gently

761
00:49:18,472 --> 00:49:22,472
世界を変える力が
Whispering that the power

762
00:49:22,472 --> 00:49:25,972
その手にあると囁く
To change the world is in those hands

763
00:49:26,022 --> 00:49:30,522
終わらない夢を見よう
Let's dream an endless dream

764
00:49:30,522 --> 00:49:34,972

Ich mag wollen oder nicht
Whether I want to or not

810
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,080
ich muss dem Pfad folgen
I must follow the path

811
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,080
ich bin nicht frei von dieser Welt
I am not free from this world

812
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,380
Was willst du von mir?
What do you want from me?

813
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,080
Ich mag wollen oder nicht
Whether I want to or not

814
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,080
ich muss dem Pfad folgen
I must follow the path

815
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:48,080
ich bin nicht frei von dieser Welt
I am not free from this world

816
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:51,580
Egal wie hart du auch bist
No matter how hard you are

817
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:54,380
fliege höher, laufe viel schneller
fly higher, run much faster

818
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:59,580
vergiss die Wahrheit nicht
don't forget the truth

819
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:03,080
Ja, ich bin viel stärker
Yes, I am much stronger

820
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,080
als ich je gedacht hab'
than I ever thought

821
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,380
du bindest einen Blumenkranz
you're binding a flower wreath

822
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:12,380
wieso siehst du so traurig aus?
why do you look so sad?

823
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,080
YAY!

824
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,080
Whoa!

825
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,080
Was that epic or what?

826
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:39,280
Blumenkranz, I think, is a song that many people wanted me to do for a long time.

827
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,380
And I finally did it!

828
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,380
Whoa!

829
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,380
German song on my live! What?!

830
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,580
Who would believe it?

831
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,080
But this vibe was, I think, really epic and amazing.

832
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,580
Thanks for singing with me, everybody, by the way!

833
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,380
Yeah...

834
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,380
But I have to kind of ruin the vibe now,

835
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,880
because I'm going to advertise to you my merchandise!

836
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,080
It...

837
00:55:00,288 --> 00:55:01,788
I've been here for over four years now,

838
00:55:01,888 --> 00:55:03,588
and I know my anniversary was a few weeks ago,

839
00:55:03,588 --> 00:55:05,188
but this got delayed, as you know,

840
00:55:05,188 --> 00:55:08,388
we're a little bit past anniversary now.

841
00:55:08,588 --> 00:55:11,188
But I haven't shown you my solo anniversary merchandise yet!

842
00:55:11,388 --> 00:55:13,688
So, here we go, it is time!

843
00:55:13,688 --> 00:55:16,888
Ta-da!

844
00:55:16,888 --> 00:55:30,088
4th Anniversary Celebration

845
00:55:18,088 --> 00:55:20,588
Oh, what is this?

846
00:55:21,088 --> 00:55:24,788
Yes, my merchandise is once again kind of kitchen-themed.

847
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:28,188
Now let's start with number one, the plate! Ta-da!

848
00:55:30,788 --> 00:55:59,088
KFP Plate

849
00:55:32,488 --> 00:55:34,988
Isn't it nice? This is like the main illustration...

850
00:55:35,088 --> 00:55:38,288
...with, you know, a little cute new outfit.

851
00:55:38,588 --> 00:55:41,888
It's like kind of like an apron or like waitress outfit.

852
00:55:41,888 --> 00:55:44,288
I really like it, it's so cute!

853
00:55:44,888 --> 00:55:47,388
And you can eat all kinds of stuff on it.

854
00:55:47,388 --> 00:55:52,588
You can eat pasta or you can eat a burger or some fries or a steak! Yes!

855
00:55:53,688 --> 00:55:56,588
Or maybe some fried eggs. But if you're not really...

856
00:55:56,588 --> 00:55:58,588
...a fried egg kind of person...

857
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,688
...we would go to next...

858
00:56:00,088 --> 00:56:24,088
KFP Egg Cup

859
00:56:00,788 --> 00:56:03,288
...the egg cup! Yes, we have an egg cup!

860
00:56:04,288 --> 00:56:07,188
Where you put in your favorite boiled egg.

861
00:56:07,188 --> 00:56:10,788
How many minutes, guys? One, two? What's your favorite like...?

862
00:56:11,288 --> 00:56:12,888
I don't know how to say it.

863
00:56:13,588 --> 00:56:16,188
Well, I like it like maybe six, seven minutes. Mmm.

864
00:56:16,588 --> 00:56:19,488
But of course, just like that, that's not enough.

865
00:56:19,488 --> 00:56:21,988
We need some salt, and maybe even some pepper.

866
00:56:21,988 --> 00:56:23,288
Do you put pepper on it? I don't.

867
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,888
But for that, I got you covered.

868
00:56:25,088 --> 00:56:52,088
KFP Enhancement Spice Container (Set of 2)

869
00:56:25,888 --> 00:56:30,588
We have salt and pepper shakers! Oh, what's so cute!

870
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:32,488
They are in the shape of an egg...

871
00:56:32,488 --> 00:56:34,088
...but they're wearing the uniform!

872
00:56:34,188 --> 00:56:37,788
What, the egg gets to wear the uniform? That's new.

873
00:56:38,288 --> 00:56:40,088
But yeah, it's really cute.

874
00:56:40,088 --> 00:56:43,188
It's your choice in which one you put salt and pepper, I think.

875
00:56:43,488 --> 00:56:46,088
But I think there's a more common way to do it.

876
00:56:46,188 --> 00:56:48,488
It's different with how many holes it has.

877
00:56:48,588 --> 00:56:50,088
Isn't it cute?

878
00:56:50,188 --> 00:56:53,688
And last but not least, another kitchen-themed thing would be... Ta-da!

879
00:56:53,088 --> 00:57:11,088
KFP Hydration Station Glass

880
00:56:53,788 --> 00:56:56,588
The glass! Yes, we have a glass!

881
00:56:56,588 --> 00:56:58,288
Wonderful!

882
00:56:58,288 --> 00:57:00,688
Finally a glass, don't break it! Be careful with it.

883
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:03,488
But in case you break it, maybe get some more.

884
00:57:03,488 --> 00:57:06,388
Maybe get some more of the plates too. Might as well, right?

885
00:57:07,488 --> 00:57:10,988
And after the glass, we have one more thing, a voice pack! Yeah!

886
00:57:11,388 --> 00:57:36,588
Situational Voice Pack "Taking flight with Wawa"

887
00:57:12,788 --> 00:57:16,188
I wrote the script, and I tried my best.

888
00:57:16,188 --> 00:57:18,188
I was writing it on the airplane...

889
00:57:18,188 --> 00:57:21,088
...and the situation is also on an airplane.

890
00:57:21,088 --> 00:57:22,088
So I was like...

891
00:57:22,388 --> 00:57:24,788
Don't worry, it's not a situation that really happened to me.

892
00:57:24,788 --> 00:57:28,088
But maybe, maybe in your brain it really happened...

893
00:57:28,088 --> 00:57:29,288
...just like for me.

894
00:57:29,288 --> 00:57:33,088
I spilled like some tomato juice and so on onto you.

895
00:57:33,188 --> 00:57:34,988
So isn't that kind of spicy? It might be.

896
00:57:34,988 --> 00:57:35,888
It might just be.

897
00:57:35,988 --> 00:57:40,088
Besides that, we have for full set an A5 clear file...

898
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:47,088
A5 clear folder

899
00:57:40,088 --> 00:57:43,688
...which has the main illustration on it, which I would love to have that.

900
00:57:43,888 --> 00:57:47,388
So make sure to get the full set to support me. I would appreciate it.

901
00:57:49,088 --> 00:57:51,688
And now we're getting into the last phase, guys.

902
00:57:53,088 --> 00:57:56,288
Don't you want to hear some Chimera again? Hmm?

903
00:57:57,088 --> 00:57:58,788
I got you covered.

904
00:57:59,088 --> 00:58:00,688
Last song, everybody. Are you ready?

905
00:58:01,288 --> 00:58:03,588
The song: CHIMERA!

906
00:58:14,588 --> 00:58:19,488
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na...

907
00:58:19,588 --> 00:58:20,688
Oh no!

908
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,488
Down into the abyss unknown

909
00:58:21,088 --> 00:58:26,088
CHIMERA - Lyrics, Music: Asteroid Music Team

910
00:58:22,588 --> 00:58:25,588
Left me bleeding heartless, so alone

911
00:58:25,788 --> 00:58:27,588
A-yo, a-yo, no control

912
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:31,488
A-yo, a-yo, don't you dare apologize

913
00:58:32,488 --> 00:58:34,188
Turned my back and felt the cold night

914
00:58:34,288 --> 00:58:36,588
Listen up 'cause here's some advice

915
00:58:36,788 --> 00:58:41,588
(Ah-ya-ya-ya-ya) You're out of time, we're out of line

916
00:58:42,588 --> 00:58:47,488
It's taking over like a renegade

917
00:58:47,588 --> 00:58:52,488
Eye for an eye, I'll make you cry

918
00:58:53,288 --> 00:58:56,488
Tearing it down, do just what I wanna

919
00:58:56,588 --> 00:58:58,588
Keep calling me a sinner

920
00:58:58,588 --> 00:59:00,488
Ch-ch-ch-chimera-era-era

921
00:59:00,588 --> 00:59:02,488
You got me twisted

922
00:59:02,588 --> 00:59:04,288
Ch-ch-ch-chimera-era-era

923
00:59:04,288 --> 00:59:05,488
(You got me twisted)

924
00:59:05,588 --> 00:59:08,588
Taking the crown, now you're calling me king

925
00:59:08,688 --> 00:59:10,588
You're gonna hear them all sing

926
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:12,488
Ch-ch-ch-chimera-era-era

927
00:59:12,588 --> 00:59:14,488
You got me twisted

928
00:59:14,588 --> 00:59:15,888
Ch-ch-ch-chimera-era-era

929
00:59:16,588 --> 00:59:19,488
Don't back it up, don't back it up, keep that aim

930
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:22,488
I got thoughts that will drive you insane

931
00:59:22,588 --> 00:59:25,188
Come along if you like, we'll have a lot of fun

932
00:59:25,288 --> 00:59:27,588
But I got a lot of fight

933
00:59:27,688 --> 00:59:30,488
I do what I want, make sure you don't forget

934
00:59:30,588 --> 00:59:33,488
An army on my back, I'm sick and sadistic

935
00:59:33,588 --> 00:59:35,488
No living in a lie, pariah in the light

936
00:59:35,588 --> 00:59:38,488
I wanna see the way you bleed

937
00:59:39,088 --> 00:59:44,288
It's taking over like a renegade

938
00:59:44,288 --> 00:59:49,288
Eye for an eye, I'll make you cry

939
00:59:49,888 --> 00:59:53,188
Tearing it down, do just what I wanna

940
00:59:53,288 --> 00:59:55,388
Keep calling me a sinner

941
00:59:55,388 --> 00:59:57,288
Ch-ch-ch-chimera-era-era

942
00:59:57,388 --> 00:59:59,288
You got me twisted

943
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:00,088
Ch-ch-ch-chimera-era-era

944
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,396
Taking the crown now you calling me king

945
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:03,796
You're gonna hear em all sing

946
01:00:05,296 --> 01:00:07,496
Chimera-era-era-ya

947
01:00:07,796 --> 01:00:10,196
Chimera-era-era-ya

948
01:00:11,896 --> 01:00:13,496
I want it all, so give me some more

949
01:00:14,496 --> 01:00:16,896
Flames burn me up down into my core

950
01:00:17,496 --> 01:00:19,496
Oh you wish I'd stay down but then I just rise

951
01:00:22,596 --> 01:00:24,196
You're not my enemy

952
01:00:25,096 --> 01:00:26,596
Baby you're dead to me

953
01:00:27,596 --> 01:00:29,396
Hear my voice screaming out loud

954
01:00:30,396 --> 01:00:33,096
Don't doubt, yeah!

955
01:00:34,496 --> 01:00:36,796
La la la la la la

956
01:00:36,796 --> 01:00:39,196
Chimera-era-era-ya

957
01:00:40,096 --> 01:00:43,196
La la la la la la, Chimera

958
01:00:45,396 --> 01:00:48,396
Tearing it down do just what I wanna

959
01:00:48,396 --> 01:00:50,496
Keep calling me a sinner (Don't you think so)

960
01:00:50,896 --> 01:00:53,196
Chimera-era-era-ya (Don't you twist it)

961
01:00:53,496 --> 01:00:55,796
Chimera-era-era-ya

962
01:00:56,396 --> 01:00:59,096
Taking the crown now you calling me king

963
01:00:59,096 --> 01:01:01,696
You're gonna hear em all sing

964
01:01:02,196 --> 01:01:04,396
Chimera-era-era-ya

965
01:01:04,796 --> 01:01:07,096
Chimera-era-era-ya

966
01:01:07,796 --> 01:01:10,396
La la la la la la, Chimera-era-era-ya

967
01:01:12,896 --> 01:01:17,596
La la la la la la, Chimera

968
01:01:29,396 --> 01:01:31,296
Hah... Chimera!

969
01:01:31,296 --> 01:01:34,296
That was fun to do that again.

970
01:01:35,096 --> 01:01:36,596
Did you press 4?

971
01:01:36,896 --> 01:01:37,896
Thank you.

972
01:01:38,296 --> 01:01:41,396
So, with the next song, it'll actually be the last song.

973
01:01:41,896 --> 01:01:44,896
But this one is a very special one because

974
01:01:44,896 --> 01:01:48,596
for the first time ever, you will hear my next song, "MIRAGE".

975
01:01:49,096 --> 01:01:51,596
And for this one, what's really special is,

976
01:01:52,096 --> 01:01:54,496
for the first time ever, I'm bringing in

977
01:01:54,496 --> 01:01:55,896
some back-up dancers, back-dancers,

978
01:01:56,096 --> 01:01:57,696
who are gonna join me.

979
01:01:58,296 --> 01:01:59,596
So, please enjoy.

980
01:02:00,096 --> 01:02:03,096
And afterwards, the MV will be released.

981
01:02:03,596 --> 01:02:06,596
So, hopefully everything goes according to plan.

982
01:02:07,096 --> 01:02:09,596
So, please make sure to check that out too

983
01:02:10,096 --> 01:02:11,896
and support my new song...

984
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:14,096
..."MIRAGE"!

985
01:02:22,096 --> 01:02:27,096
MIRAGE
Lyrics: Asteroid Music Team (monii)
Music: Asteroid Music Team (monii, Johnny R, Ari)

986
01:02:35,296 --> 01:02:37,896
Mirror's reflection, going under.

987
01:02:38,696 --> 01:02:40,596
Confused obsession.

988
01:02:40,796 --> 01:02:43,196
I still wonder if I was made for you,

989
01:02:43,396 --> 01:02:46,096
if I could only see, oh please

990
01:02:49,496 --> 01:02:50,996
Make me up, a new

991
01:02:50,996 --> 01:02:53,196
persona, calculated perfectly for you

992
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,396
Pretending like it's all just

993
01:02:57,396 --> 01:02:58,596
for me? Don't think so

994
01:02:58,596 --> 01:03:00,196
Live life incognito

995
01:03:00,196 --> 01:03:02,096
Oh I ~

996
01:03:02,096 --> 01:03:04,596
play god and yet I'm asking why

997
01:03:04,596 --> 01:03:07,496
You never see what I want, what I need

998
01:03:07,596 --> 01:03:08,596
Oh do you? (No, no)

999
01:03:08,696 --> 01:03:10,896
Oh do you? (No, no)

1000
01:03:10,896 --> 01:03:13,696
Follow through, light you pursue but now

1001
01:03:15,596 --> 01:03:17,596
Ahh ~

1002
01:03:18,896 --> 01:03:20,796
You sold me on a mirage

1003
01:03:20,796 --> 01:03:22,996
I tore you up into shreds

1004
01:03:22,996 --> 01:03:25,896
I don't even know what to do with this mess

1005
01:03:26,296 --> 01:03:27,396
Tell me the cost

1006
01:03:27,396 --> 01:03:32,496
Sit, be good, play your part, my mirage

1007
01:03:33,396 --> 01:03:35,396
Livin' with regrets, those don't do anything

1008
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:38,696
Better left unsaid

1009
01:03:38,696 --> 01:03:41,396
Thought I'd be the king and queen of

1010
01:03:41,396 --> 01:03:44,296
newfound paradise

1011
01:03:44,796 --> 01:03:46,396
I'm beggin' you to see

1012
01:03:46,396 --> 01:03:48,296
I'm you, you're all of me

1013
01:03:48,296 --> 01:03:49,996
It seems like everyone wants it

1014
01:03:49,996 --> 01:03:52,296
All around and round, running round around,

1015
01:03:52,296 --> 01:03:53,696
on and on

1016
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:56,296
This cycle keepin' me captive, escape my way

1017
01:03:56,296 --> 01:03:57,596
You say I'm way too fragile

1018
01:03:57,596 --> 01:03:58,996
I'm just your perfect idol

1019
01:03:58,996 --> 01:04:02,096
Break me, shape me, I ~

1020
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:05,196
You never see what I want, what I need

1021
01:04:05,396 --> 01:04:06,196
Oh do you? (No, no)

1022
01:04:06,396 --> 01:04:08,596
Oh do you? (No, no)

1023
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:12,396
Follow through, light you pursue but now

1024
01:04:14,296 --> 01:04:16,096
Ahh ~

1025
01:04:17,396 --> 01:04:19,496
You sold me on a mirage

1026
01:04:19,496 --> 01:04:21,596
I tore you up into shreds

1027
01:04:21,596 --> 01:04:24,396
I don't even know what to do with this mess

1028
01:04:24,796 --> 01:04:26,096
Tell me the cost

1029
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:31,096
Sit, be good, play your part, my mirage

1030
01:04:31,596 --> 01:04:32,896
Mi-mi-mimi-mirage you

1031
01:04:32,896 --> 01:04:34,596
Spinnin' little lies, new disguise, on and on,

1032
01:04:34,596 --> 01:04:36,596
and on!

1033
01:04:36,896 --> 01:04:38,496
This mirage I'm lost

1034
01:04:38,596 --> 01:04:41,096
Who owns your heart? Mirage

1035
01:04:47,396 --> 01:04:50,096
You, you... you make me fall in line ~

1036
01:04:53,496 --> 01:04:56,596
You make me... (You, you... you... you...)

1037
01:04:57,096 --> 01:04:59,096
No ooh!

1038
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:01,304
Oh...

1039
01:05:01,304 --> 01:05:02,904
You sold me on a mirage

1040
01:05:02,904 --> 01:05:04,304
I tore you up into shreds

1041
01:05:04,304 --> 01:05:07,704
I don't even know what to do with this mess

1042
01:05:07,704 --> 01:05:09,004
Tell me the cost

1043
01:05:09,004 --> 01:05:15,604
Sit be good, play your part, my mirage

1044
01:05:15,604 --> 01:05:16,804
Mi-mi-mimi-mirage you

1045
01:05:16,804 --> 01:05:20,204
Spinnin' little lies, new disguise, on and on

1046
01:05:20,204 --> 01:05:21,704
And on and on and on

1047
01:05:21,704 --> 01:05:23,204
This mirage, I'm lost

1048
01:05:23,204 --> 01:05:32,104
Who owns your heart? Mirage...

1049
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:43,104
Yeah...

1050
01:05:55,104 --> 01:06:03,570
MIRAGE PREMIERE NOW!
