Under the moonlight we kiss goodbye

00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,500
You walk up wearing your disguise

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,500
Never gave me something, and don't think twice

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,500
And I told you all the things I would do

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,600
But does it matter when you chase after

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,800
the pleasure you can have?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,500
Now look where you ended up at

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Cause out of seven billion people

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
you won't find another me

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,200
If you want it all I tell you now

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,300
my love don't come for free

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,300
Oh baby, baby, yeah, yeah,

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,600
you've got to treat me like a lady

16
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,500
Yeah, yeah, cause I don't need no man to save me

17
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,800
Boy I'll make you crazy, so look into my eyes

18
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,500
And be real with me tonight

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,500
Treat me like, treat me like, ladylike

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,500
Treat me like, ladylike

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,000
All your sweet talk and flattery, boy,

that shit don't fly

23
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,500
I got 20-20 vision, I see through every lie

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,500
Stay deceiving as you see fit, you're just that type of guy

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,500
The stupid girls believe it, but I'm another kind

26
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,500
Should've known that you'd get what's coming too

27
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,400
Everything that you had wasn't meant for you

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,500
Got 'em all up sick like a virus,

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,400
don't infect yourself this time

00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500

you've got to treat me like a lady

36
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,800
Yeah, yeah, I'll throw you out the way you came in

37
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,800
Cause solitude don't phase me

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,500
So look into my eyes and be real with me tonight

39
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,800
I am, hands up and set it up

40
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,000
Cause all that you've got is one chance

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,500
to turn it around

42
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,800
And I've had enough

43
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,300
If you want to earn it then work it,

44
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,000

I'm alive, still breathing,

61
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,200
stop to hide, done grieving

62
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,000
Realized that to survive,

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,500
someone's got to stand and fight

64
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,400
And I've tried to believe in,

65
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,000
only time stops the bleeding

66
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm not waiting anymore,

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I know what I came here for

68
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,000
Cause feelings are temporary,

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,500
but broken hearts keep scars for life

70
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,500
The darkness no longer scares me,

71
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,200
I'm chasing and hunting

72
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,000
And this time I'm coming for blood

73
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,300
Ahhh...

74
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,800
Be the last one to laugh when you run out

75
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,200
of breath catching up

76
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,300
Ahhh...

77
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,500
I'm a breath and a half, baby,

78
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,400
you don't even know me at all

79
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,200
I'm alive, still kicking,

80
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,750
break the rules, rewrite the system

81
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,000
And my story wasn't done,

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,200
sharpen knife and cut the guns

83
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,000
Cut the cord, burn the witch,

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,600
and you'll regret what you're missing

85
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,500
And I'll take it to the grave,

86
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,000
that's the price that you pay

87
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,000
Cause feelings are temporary,

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,500
but broken hearts keep scars for life

89
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,200
The darkness no longer scares me,

And well, welcome everybody first of all to my concert!

108
00:06:52,608 --> 00:06:55,108
I hope you enjoyed the first two songs.

109
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,608
How was it? How was it? How was it?

110
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:00,108
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

111
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,608
I hope I already got you hyped up. This is gonna be a really fun show.

112
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:08,608
But a fun show also needs some special guests, some people to talk to,

113
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:12,108
maybe some call-ins, some games.

114
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:16,608
And don't worry, I got you covered. I have invited a very special friend

115
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:20,608
to play a very special game together with.

116
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,108
And my friend is none other than my ODENZ member,

117
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:27,608
Nenechi!

118
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:31,108

120
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:31,908

122
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,108
ありがとう！あ、そうだ、お誕生日だった。
Thank you! That's right, it's my birthday,

123
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,608
そうだ、そうだ、そうだ。
I almost forgot,

124
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:39,608
ねねち、英語で自己紹介お願いします。
Nenechi, can you introduce yourself in English, please?

125
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:41,108
はい！
Sure!

126
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:45,608
hololive 5th Generation, Momosuzu Nene!

127
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:47,108
Yay!

128
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,608
来てくれてありがとう！
Thank you for coming!

129
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,108
こちらこそありがとう！
Thanks for having me!

130
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,108
Thank you.

131
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:55,108
So Nenechi and I will be playing "Idol Shiritori"!

132
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,608
じゃあ、ねねちとはね、アイドルしりとりという私が考えた天才のゲームをやります。
It's a brilliant game that I came up with,

133
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:01,108
Yay! That's right! After all,

134
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:05,108
if I'm the top idol in hololive English,

135
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,608
もちろん！
Of course!

136
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,608
then for hololive Japan, it would have to be Nenechi!

137
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:11,608
あーありがとう！
Gosh, thank you!

138
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:15,608
Nenechi is hololive Japan's number one idol in my heart.

139
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:19,608
So I thought that the following game would be very fitting.

140
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:23,608
So I thought of this game, the rules are the following.

141
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,608
First of all, the name is "Idol Shiritori".

142
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:30,608
The normal Shiritori works the following: I say a Japanese word,

143
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:34,108
and they usually are built up in syllables.

144
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:38,108
So the syllable that it ends with, Nenechi will have to think of

145
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:42,108
a new word that starts with that syllable.

146
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:46,108
And then we keep on connecting and connecting until someone makes a mistake

147
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:50,108
or says a word that already has been said. But here is the twist:

148
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:55,108
we can only use idol words, or cute or girly words, feminine words.

149
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:59,608
So anything that's cutesy and idol-y.

150
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:04,108
Yeah, I think us two, we shouldn't have any issues with that.

151
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,108
うちらだったら問題ないよね、アイドルしりとり！
Idol Shiritori should be a piece of cake for us, right?

152
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:11,108
できるよ、できるよ！ I can! Okay!
We can do it! I can! Okay!

153
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:14,608
Okay, then let's give it a shot! ねねち準備OKかな？
Okay, then let's give it a shot! Nenechi you ready?

154
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:16,108
いよー！
Ready!

155
00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:19,608
なるべくあの、早めのペースでやりましょう。
Let's try to keep the pace up.

156
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:21,608
Okay! All right!

157
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:24,608
よし、じゃあ始めよう！ スタート！

そうかもしれない。
Probably for the best!

265
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:45,364
Because I lost, so we decided that we both...

266
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:48,864
...we both win in the end. Yes.

267
00:13:48,964 --> 00:13:51,864

00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:33,964
SPARKS / Takanashi Kiara

284
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:47,864
Lying down on the floor late night

285
00:14:47,964 --> 00:14:52,364
and you don't know, don't know, don't know what to do

286
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:55,864
Hard to tell what's wrong what's right

287
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:59,864
if you start now, don't know, don't know what to do

288
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:03,964
The storm hits hard and you're losing the way

289
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,753
Take a chance

290
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:06,053
And dance in the rain

291
00:15:06,053 --> 00:15:07,753
Cause you got the heat

292
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:09,053
Never throw it away

293
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:10,353
Don't forget, don't forget

294
00:15:10,353 --> 00:15:11,653
What I said

295
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:14,053
Get out of your head

296
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:16,053
Life is only what you make it

297
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:17,653
You're gonna be okay

298
00:15:17,953 --> 00:15:19,253
So go ahead

299
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,453
And do it, do it

300
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:21,953
If you want it, let's get to it

301
00:15:21,953 --> 00:15:23,953
Everybody's gonna know your name

302
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:25,953
Cause Sparks like the flame

303
00:15:25,953 --> 00:15:28,453
Turn the dark of the night into day

304
00:15:28,453 --> 00:15:29,953
Don't stop, don't stop

305
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:31,653
Just go your own way

306
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:33,453
So don't be afraid

307
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:35,453
Trust your heart, keep your head in the game

308
00:15:35,453 --> 00:15:36,953
Keep up, keep up

309
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:38,953
And never be afraid

310
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:40,953
Gonna make it hot like a volcano

311
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:42,453
Strike a match and burn it up

312
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:44,453
Kick your feet against the table

313
00:15:44,453 --> 00:15:46,453
To the beat of your own drum

314
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:48,453
Sparks like the flame

315
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:50,453
So don't wait, start a fire today

316
00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:51,953
Don't stop, don't stop

317
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,453
Just go your own way

318
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:56,453
Never looking back

319
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:57,953
Take the fast lane now

320
00:15:57,953 --> 00:15:59,953
In the driver's seat

321
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:01,453
Strap-in, gas pedal down

322
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:03,453
We're going so fast

323
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:04,953
That it should be allowed

324
00:16:04,953 --> 00:16:06,953
That's how we like it

325
00:16:06,953 --> 00:16:08,453
You heard what I said

326
00:16:08,953 --> 00:16:10,953
Get out of your head

327
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:12,953

And move it, move it

Unless you try, you won't get through it

332
00:16:20,953 --> 00:16:22,953
Everybody's gonna know your name

333
00:16:22,953 --> 00:16:24,953
Cause Sparks like the flame

334
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:27,453

You'll rise from the ashes, you'll rise!

345

And never be afraid

353
00:17:24,453 --> 00:17:26,453
Gonna make it hot like a volcano

354
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:27,953
Strike a match and burn it up

355
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:29,953
Kick your feet against the table

356
00:17:29,953 --> 00:17:31,953

My name is Perfection

365
00:18:13,953 --> 00:18:16,953
I come from the net inside your personal computer

366
00:18:16,953 --> 00:18:18,953
A tool for the dreamers

367
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:20,953
Make you a believer

368
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:23,953
I'm so worldwide, worldwide, holy virtual diva

369
00:18:26,953 --> 00:18:28,953
But sometimes I do

370
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:30,953
Don't you think of the things they told you?

371
00:18:30,953 --> 00:18:32,953
There must be more than this

372
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:35,953
There must be more than what you know too

373
00:18:36,953 --> 00:18:38,953
I wasn't made to feel

374
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:40,953
But lately I can't help it

375
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,953
If there's a way out of here

376
00:18:42,953 --> 00:18:44,953
I've got an idea

377
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:47,453
Bring it all down

378
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:48,953
I'll make it come around

379
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:51,453
I'll burn this whole facade to the ground

380
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:53,453
I'm sick of windows

381
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:54,953
I need some physical

382
00:18:54,953 --> 00:18:56,453

383
00:18:56,453 --> 00:18:57,953
Whine about your issues

384
00:18:57,953 --> 00:18:59,953
Watch the life become too short

385
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:01,953
Right, I got it for you

386
00:19:01,953 --> 00:19:03,453
How do you think I feel?

387
00:19:03,453 --> 00:19:05,453
None of this is real, singing I love soft sets

388
00:19:05,453 --> 00:19:06,953
Digital girl

389
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:09,453
So I woke up with a headache today

390
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:10,953
Just kidding, I don't feel pain

391
00:19:10,953 --> 00:19:13,453
To be honest I don't even gotta sleep

392
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,953
And that's the difference between you and me

393

Look into my eyes, change your mind so quick

396
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,953
You won't believe the things that I've seen and...

397
00:19:24,953 --> 00:19:26,953
No day is like the other

398

Be anything I wanna

399
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:31,453
There is no suffering, wars or existential crisis trauma

400
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:33,953
But I feel something inside of my heart

401
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:36,453
And it's telling me to go before I fall apart

402
00:19:41,453 --> 00:19:42,953
Bring it all down

403
00:19:42,953 --> 00:19:44,453

404
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:46,953

00:26:54,182 --> 00:26:56,882
だめだって頑張らなくちゃ
I can't do that, I have to do my best

499
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,982
そっと声に出してみた
I tried to say it softly

500
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:16,582
8時0分 2両目
8:00 AM, the second train car

501
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:19,782
座られてた特等席
My special seat was taken

502
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:22,882
ついてないな空模様まで
I'm not lucky, even the weather

503
00:27:23,282 --> 00:27:24,982
泣きそうです
Looks like it's going to cry

504
00:27:26,382 --> 00:27:29,082
8時7分準備まだ
8:07 AM, I'm not ready yet

505
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:32,282
ちょっと待ってドキドキが
Wait a second, my heart is racing

506
00:27:32,682 --> 00:27:35,382
震え混じりその言葉は
Those words, mixed with trembling

507
00:27:35,782 --> 00:27:38,282
かき消された
Were drowned out

508
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,482
雨宿り立ち尽くす僕に
To me, standing still taking shelter from the rain

509
00:27:41,882 --> 00:27:44,582
「傘をどうぞ」
"Here, have an umbrella"

510
00:27:44,982 --> 00:27:47,682
君は少し恥ずかしそうに
You, looking a little embarrassed

511
00:27:48,082 --> 00:27:50,782
下を向いた
Looked down

512
00:27:51,882 --> 00:27:54,482
「ありがとう」震えていた
"Thank you", it was trembling

513
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:57,682
練習してない言葉
The words I hadn't practiced

514
00:27:58,082 --> 00:28:00,782
言えたから頑張らなくちゃ
Since I said them, I have to do my best

515
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:03,782
だって二日会えないからね
Because I won't see you for two days

516
00:28:04,982 --> 00:28:07,582
大好きな君を見てる
I'm looking at you whom I love

517
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:10,782
それだけで満足しちゃって
Just that makes me satisfied

518
00:28:11,182 --> 00:28:13,882
月曜日も頑張らなくちゃ
I have to do my best on Monday too

519
00:28:14,282 --> 00:28:16,982
そっと声に出してみた
I tried to say it softly

520
00:28:29,982 --> 00:28:34,482
夢では自然に話せるのに
In my dreams, I can talk normally

521
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:38,682
勇気のテスト乗り越えるから
I'll pass the test of courage

522
00:28:39,182 --> 00:28:41,782
少し待ってて
So wait for me a bit

523
00:28:42,882 --> 00:28:45,582
おはようのオーディションして
I practice my "Good Morning" audition

524
00:28:45,982 --> 00:28:48,682
髪型もバッチリOK
My hair is also perfectly OK

525
00:28:49,082 --> 00:28:51,782
8時7分に君を待ってる
I'm waiting for you at 8:07

526
00:28:52,182 --> 00:28:54,882
だって今日は言えるから
Because today I can say it

527
00:28:55,982 --> 00:28:58,682
おやすみも言いたいけれど
I want to say "Good Night" too, but

528
00:28:59,082 --> 00:29:01,782
ちょっと待って大好きな
Wait a second, my favorite

529
00:29:02,182 --> 00:29:06,982
言葉なんだって君に会えるからね
Words, because I can see you

530
00:29:27,882 --> 00:29:30,582
Alright everybody! How was that?

531
00:29:30,582 --> 00:29:32,582
Did you like the previous songs?

532
00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:34,732
It was "Zetsubigaku" from Matsuura Aya,

533
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:36,882
and "Kinyoubi no Ohayou" from HoneyWorks, yeah!

534
00:29:37,482 --> 00:29:39,982
Um, especially the "Zetsubigaku"

535
00:29:39,982 --> 00:29:42,982
I was really excited to perform for you guys

536
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:45,982
because it's a Hello! Project song

537
00:29:45,982 --> 00:29:48,582
that probably a lot of you guys don't know,

538
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:50,582
but did you like it? Did you like it? Did you like it?

539
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:52,582
It's pretty cool. Yeah.

540
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,582
Matsuura Aya is good!

541
00:29:54,582 --> 00:29:57,482
So, next up, we will have more guests,

542
00:29:57,482 --> 00:30:00,482
more guests, more guests!

543
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,832
guests...

544
00:30:01,832 --> 00:30:02,932
Previously it was Nenechi.

545
00:30:02,932 --> 00:30:05,132
Who could possibly be my next guests?

546
00:30:05,132 --> 00:30:07,132
What do you think guys? Hmm...

547
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:10,132
Hmm... Well, more friends are coming!

548
00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:15,132
None other than my beloved Turduckin Holotori members!

549
00:30:16,132 --> 00:30:20,632
Subaru Oozora! Pavolia Reine! Yahoo!

550
00:30:21,132 --> 00:30:24,632
Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday Kiara!

551
00:30:24,632 --> 00:30:27,132
Happy birthday!

552
00:30:27,132 --> 00:30:29,132
Thank you! Thank you!

553
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:31,632
嬉しいな。Very happy.
I'm so happy. Very happy.

554
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:34,132
Thank you too for coming,

555
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:37,132
for flying over here like the birds you are.

556
00:30:37,132 --> 00:30:38,632
Yeah!

557
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:41,632
Well, I'm already doing gestures,

558
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:44,632
but I wonder what are we doing with you guys?

559
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:47,132
Oh, what could it be?

560
00:30:47,632 --> 00:30:49,132
Charades! We're playing charades!

561
00:30:49,632 --> 00:30:52,132
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

562
00:30:52,132 --> 00:30:53,132
いこう！
Let's go!

563
00:30:53,632 --> 00:30:57,132
The typical... the typical game that you have to play when you're in 3D.

564
00:30:57,632 --> 00:31:00,632
Well, I think we have like a synergy,

565
00:31:00,632 --> 00:31:03,132
Holotori synergy.

566
00:31:03,632 --> 00:31:06,132
So whatever movement I do,

567
00:31:06,132 --> 00:31:08,132
you will understand, right?

568
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:11,132
Yeah, of course! Okay, of course!

569
00:31:11,632 --> 00:31:13,132
Okay, actually,

570
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:16,632
the words are provided by none other than Gawr Gura,

571
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:19,132
who is somewhere behind the scenes.

572
00:31:19,632 --> 00:31:21,632
So she will feed me with the words,

573
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:24,632
I will act them out, and you guys will guess them.

574
00:31:26,132 --> 00:31:28,132
Shall we begin?

575
00:31:28,632 --> 00:31:31,632
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

576
00:31:31,632 --> 00:31:33,132
Okay, word number one.

577
00:31:33,732 --> 00:31:40,632
Snail

578
00:31:35,132 --> 00:31:37,132
Ready? Go! Let's go! Go go go!

579
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:38,132
Go! Cat?

580
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:39,632
Uh... Dog?

581
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:41,632

583
00:31:43,632 --> 00:31:45,132

584
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:47,632
Oh, almost.

585
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:49,132
Rabbit?

586
00:31:49,132 --> 00:31:50,632
Slow? Slow?

587
00:31:54,632 --> 00:31:57,632
Log? Log? Snake?

588
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:02,632
Almost! Breathe it! Breathe!

589
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,132
Slimy! Slimy!

590
00:32:07,132 --> 00:32:09,132
Is it slimy? Slime?

00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:35,632
Brush my teeth!

You, me!

Wait! Reine, I...

644
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:14,891
...I think this could be seen as...

645
00:35:14,891 --> 00:35:17,491
...as me losing after such a winning streak.

646
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:18,491
I think I lost.

647
00:35:21,091 --> 00:35:22,691

00:35:28,491 --> 00:35:30,191
This is the- the- the Duck Dance!

00:35:56,091 --> 00:35:57,691
But it's okay...

662
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,691
Wow!

00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:21,091
I love you!

677
00:36:21,191 --> 00:36:22,191
I love you!

678
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:23,091
So cute you!
You're so cute!

679
00:36:23,191 --> 00:36:23,991
Love you!

680
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:24,891
Bye bye!

681
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:25,791
I love you!

682
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:26,691
Love you!

683
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:28,191
Bye bye! Hehe!

684
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:37,691
FEVER NIGHT / Takanashi Kiara

685
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:01,791
I'm tired of the same song

686
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:04,691
Every day like it's on repeat

687
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:07,191
I need a risky breakdown

688
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,691
Oh honey, the night is calling

689
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:17,191
Go-meters steady, simple melody

690
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:20,191
Can you make it original?

691
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:25,191
Take me away like it's just the two of us

692
00:37:26,091 --> 00:37:29,191
I'm ready, do you feel the music baby?

693
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,891
Meet me underneath the strobe lights

694
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:37,491
Come alive, move my feet to something new

695
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:41,091
I don't need no drinks tonight

696
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:44,691
Give me that beat, get me dancing

697
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:46,991
Feel it rush through me

698
00:37:46,991 --> 00:37:49,691
Let this new sound take over me

699
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,991
Intoxicating, DJ keep playing

700
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:12,891
Lately I'm dancing alone

701
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,691
So robotic, so emotionless

702
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:18,991
But then I see you across the dance floor

703
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:21,091
So now honey, follow me

704
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,691
I need a thrilling red-hot melody

705
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:31,691
Oh, something to keep me up all night

706
00:38:34,091 --> 00:38:36,691
Don't look away, now it's just the two of us

707
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:40,191
I'm ready, do you feel the music baby?

708
00:38:42,591 --> 00:38:45,091
Meet me underneath the strobe lights

709
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,991
Come alive, moving my feet to something so new

710
00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:52,491
I don't need no drinks tonight

711
00:38:53,091 --> 00:38:55,691
Give me that beat, get me dancing

712
00:38:56,491 --> 00:38:58,191
Feel it rush through me

00:38:58,191 --> 00:39:00,691
この心の音を合わせて
Synchronizing the sound of our hearts

714
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:04,191

715
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:05,891
聞かせてあげる
I'll let you hear it

Heartbeat ba-da-ba-da-bi, synchronizing, follow my heartbeat

717
00:39:10,191 --> 00:39:12,691
Crazy for your rhythm

718
00:39:14,391 --> 00:39:16,991
I'm in a trance with the way that you moving

719
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:19,691
You got me shouting, glowing like a prism

720
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,091
That disco ball makes me wild

721
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:24,191
Don't care who's watching us, so baby

722
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:26,691
Meet me underneath the strobe lights

723
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:30,691
Come alive, moving my feet to something so new

Feel it rush through me

730
00:39:47,691 --> 00:39:50,191
Baby, can we dance until the day like crazy?

731
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:53,691
About the sound I'm making with you

732
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:31,299

Rise and true, come to light at break of day

I've been trying to find my destiny

758
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:59,799
But they keep pushing and pulling me astray

759
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:04,799
If I go wrong, what awaits me in the dark?

760
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:09,799
Could you tell me please where I need to go?

761
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:25,299
Tell me, I can hear it clearly

Raising flames, show me the path to luminous

769
00:43:57,499 --> 00:44:03,099
And in the next life too, I promise I will find you

770
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,799
Yay! How was that?

771
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:36,799
Yeah, we just, for the first time ever, performed 'Fever Night' and 'HINOTORI'.

772
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:41,299
Yeah, the classic 'HINOTORI'. I bet you all wanted to see it once again.

773
00:44:41,499 --> 00:44:45,299
But 'Fever Night' is new, very new. My newest single.

774
00:44:45,499 --> 00:44:48,299
So I hope you're listening to it a lot. Are you?

775
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:50,799
Of course. Please be always streaming Kiara's songs.

776
00:44:50,799 --> 00:44:53,799
Thank you very much for your support.

777
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:56,799
So, you thought I was done with call-ins, huh?

778
00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:00,299
No, no, no, no, no. There's more.

779
00:45:00,299 --> 00:45:03,799
There's more, there's more, there's more.

780
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:06,838
Wait a second,

781
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:08,738
aren't we missing certain Myth members?

782
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:10,438
Yes, we are! Of course we are!

783
00:45:10,438 --> 00:45:13,338
So please come and say hello to Gura and Callie!

784
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:17,338
Wee-wee-wee-wee!

785
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:19,838
Ai, ai, ai, what'd you do? Howdy! Howdy Kiara!

786
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:21,738
Hello! Hello! Hello! Happy birthday, Kiara!

787
00:45:21,738 --> 00:45:24,038
Happy birthday! Thank you! It is indeed...

788
00:45:24,038 --> 00:45:26,338
You are of birthday. Well, you could say it's not my birthday,

789
00:45:26,338 --> 00:45:29,038
but it's my birb-day! Birb-birb-birb-birb-day!

790
00:45:29,038 --> 00:45:32,738
Ah, I get it. You made a funny word joke. Sasuga Tenshou.

791
00:45:32,738 --> 00:45:36,538
Looking so cute. Oh my god, yes, finally!

792
00:45:36,538 --> 00:45:40,038
Finally, like, I can do my whole, I can show off my body in 3D

793
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:43,738
for a whole stream, yeah! It's so detailed and beautiful.

794
00:45:43,738 --> 00:45:47,038
Oh, thank you for looking at me. What's your favorite part? Tell me window.

795
00:45:47,038 --> 00:45:49,738
Uh, I like the bow on the back. Yeah, the bow's cool, right?

796
00:45:49,738 --> 00:45:52,038
You never get to see that. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

797
00:45:52,038 --> 00:45:55,538
you can only see that in 3D. Right, and the little wings too, so precious.

798
00:45:55,538 --> 00:45:59,338
Ooh, cute. So you gonna pull out your sword? You gonna get your sword out someday for us?

799
00:45:59,338 --> 00:46:02,038
Oh, that's a good question. Well, maybe another time.

800
00:46:02,038 --> 00:46:05,338
Maybe, maybe at a 3D debut stream, which this is not. Right. Yeah, right, right.

801
00:46:05,338 --> 00:46:09,738
Alright, well girls, we are the same generation, so one would assume that you know a thing or two about me, right?

802
00:46:09,738 --> 00:46:14,038
Yeah, of course! We've only met met many times. Yes, especially us, yes, yes.

803
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:17,338
But also me and Gura have now met in real life, thankfully. Yay! Yay!

804
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:21,038
So you have, hopefully, a lot of knowledge about me. And I will test that with the Kiwawa Quiz!

805
00:46:21,038 --> 00:46:25,038
Kiwawa Quiz, let's go! Wee-wee-wee-wee! Skrah!

806
00:46:25,038 --> 00:46:29,338
I have five questions for you girls. And if you answer at least four of the questions correctly,

807
00:46:29,338 --> 00:46:33,538
then I shall take you out to dinner sometime! For free! Oh, cool! I was gonna ask for a prize.

808
00:46:33,538 --> 00:46:37,338
Of course there's a prize! Yes, there's always a prize at KFP. So, are you ready for the first question?

809
00:46:37,338 --> 00:46:40,038
Get it on! By the way, you can work together if you want. Oh!

810
00:46:40,038 --> 00:46:43,338
What it is? Let's do it. Yeah, put the two the two biggest brains in Hololive Myth together.

811
00:46:43,338 --> 00:46:47,538
This should be no problem. What do you call yourselves again? The bone heads? No. Bone bros! Bone bros!

812
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:50,338
The Bone Bros will solve all the questions. Bone heads and feathers.

813
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:54,038
No, we got this on lock. It's just math. Just don't ask us about math. Oh no, no, I don't even know math either.

814
00:46:54,038 --> 00:46:58,038
So, the first question! Are you ready? It's easy. Question number one...

815
00:46:58,038 --> 00:47:01,738
What does KFP stand for?

816
00:47:02,038 --> 00:47:06,338
Kiara Fried Phoenix! Oh, excuse me, your birdness! Kiara Fried... no, no, no, Kiara Fried Phoenix.

817
00:47:06,338 --> 00:47:09,038
Did you say Kiara Kentucky? No, I've never heard of that place. I said Kiara...

818
00:47:09,038 --> 00:47:13,038
you guys misheard, sorry. That's your ears' problem. I said Kiara Fried Phoenix. I know KFP. I've eaten KFP before.

819
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:16,738
I should almost give you a minus point for that answer. No, no, no, please don't take away my degree in Kiaralogy, please, I beg you.

820
00:47:16,738 --> 00:47:21,038
Okay, alright. I'll give you that point. That was easy, though. It will get more difficult. Maybe, maybe, maybe.

821
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:25,038
Uh-oh. Alright, next question! I wrote it down. Let me see. What is it? Ah, yeah, okay.

822
00:47:25,038 --> 00:47:29,538
Question number two! Imagine some quiz lights, quiz show lights. (Ring sound effect)

823
00:47:29,538 --> 00:47:33,538
A new rule: I will only allow correct answers. If you lock in one wrong answer, that's a no point!

824
00:47:33,538 --> 00:47:38,038
Alright Gura, don't fuck this up. Yeah, alright... like, okay.

825
00:47:38,038 --> 00:47:42,038
What's the name of Kiara's 2nd single?

826
00:47:38,038 --> 00:47:42,038
Okay, so question number two: What was Takanashi Kiara's second original single?

827
00:47:42,038 --> 00:47:45,038
Heart Challenger! Yeah! Yeah! I was gonna say that too! Let's go!

828
00:47:45,038 --> 00:47:48,038
Sorry Gumbus, I'm a little faster. You need to give her some time to shine. Gura needs to shine.

829
00:47:48,038 --> 00:47:52,538
Okay Gura, the next one's yours. I'll be faster. No, it's gonna get harder. I'm leaving the hard ones for Gura, actually. It's all part of my plan.

830
00:47:52,538 --> 00:47:55,338
Smart, smart. Crafty. By the way, what was Kiara's first song, by the way? Extra point?

831
00:47:55,338 --> 00:47:59,038
Hinotori! My third, my third... sorry, third. Did you... probably acoustically misheard.

832
00:47:59,038 --> 00:48:01,338
Oh, I thought you said first. No, third. I thought you said first.

833
00:50:01,395 --> 00:50:02,695
Thanks... sorry, I can't...

834
00:50:02,695 --> 00:50:05,495
Yeah, my TH always sounds like an F.

835
00:50:05,495 --> 00:50:06,795
It's okay, it's cute.

836
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:10,495
My... number three of my song was...
but that's not the question.

837
00:50:10,495 --> 00:50:11,895
Sparks, yes. Okay.

838
00:50:12,595 --> 00:50:14,895
Sparks let the flame... whoa...

839
00:50:14,895 --> 00:50:18,195
In the dark there's an ember... burning up...

840
00:50:18,195 --> 00:50:20,795
Just keep on... just keep on the flame...

841
00:50:20,795 --> 00:50:24,395
Okay, no, that was not the first question.

842
00:50:24,395 --> 00:50:27,895
The first question is coming now.
Can I see it? It was...

843
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:31,395
Okay, okay. Now this one, let's see.

844
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:33,795
Question number three! Dun-dun-dun-dun!

845
00:50:33,795 --> 00:50:37,895
What's the name of the mouse/rat...

846
00:50:37,895 --> 00:50:41,795
...that I lived with in Japan?

847
00:50:40,495 --> 00:51:22,395
Name of the mouse/rat Kiara lived with in Japan?

848
00:50:41,795 --> 00:50:42,895
I know this!

849
00:50:42,395 --> 00:50:42,995
Oh!

850
00:50:42,895 --> 00:50:44,395
I'm gonna let Gura answer.

851
00:50:44,395 --> 00:50:45,595
Let's see.

852
00:50:45,595 --> 00:50:47,895
I feel like I've been told this before.

853
00:50:47,895 --> 00:50:49,195
Oh shit.

854
00:50:49,195 --> 00:50:51,095
If you know this, oh no.

855
00:50:51,095 --> 00:50:52,995
Do you need to phone a friend?

856
00:50:54,395 --> 00:50:55,395
Casper.

857
00:50:55,395 --> 00:50:57,095
Heck yeah! Gura! Gura!

858
00:50:57,695 --> 00:50:59,595
Sorry, I can't help myself.

859
00:50:59,595 --> 00:51:00,595
It's okay!

860
00:51:00,595 --> 00:51:01,995
It's an easy one, man!

861
00:51:01,995 --> 00:51:06,895
Actually, just recently, just recently
I uploaded a video...

862
00:51:06,895 --> 00:51:11,395
...a lore video that explains the whole
story behind Casper on my channel.

863
00:51:11,395 --> 00:51:15,995
So if you guys are curious, you could go watch that
if you want to learn more about Casper.

864
00:51:16,895 --> 00:51:18,695
Casper the friendly ghost.

865
00:51:16,895 --> 00:51:18,695
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

866
00:51:18,695 --> 00:51:22,395
At first I hated him, then I loved him. Okay.

867
00:51:22,395 --> 00:51:26,895
Okay, fourth question!
If you get this one right...

868
00:51:26,895 --> 00:51:28,795
...then you already have a free dinner with me!

869
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:30,695
Thank you for carrying, Calli.

870
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,195
No problem.

871
00:51:31,195 --> 00:51:34,795
No, you got this, girl. You definitely
got the next one.

872
00:51:34,795 --> 00:51:37,795
Dude, I don't know if I do got this. I don't know.

873
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:42,295
Okay, question number four! Dun-dun-dun-dun!

874
00:51:42,295 --> 00:51:47,895
How many re-debuts did Takanashi Kiara have?

875
00:51:47,895 --> 00:51:52,395
Now think before you yell it out loud. Re-debuts.

876
00:51:48,495 --> 00:53:11,395
How many re-debuts has Kiara had?

877
00:51:52,395 --> 00:51:53,895
Re-debuts...

878
00:51:52,895 --> 00:51:53,895
Mmm-hmm.

879
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,895
Wait, what counts as a re-debut?

880
00:51:57,895 --> 00:52:02,395
Well, not debut, but debuts
after the re-debut.

881
00:52:02,395 --> 00:52:06,395
I do have a history with re-debuts.
It hasn't been one in a while...

882
00:52:06,395 --> 00:52:10,895
...but there was a time where I had
many reasons for many re-debuts.

883
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:13,195
Man, I might know this.

884
00:52:13,195 --> 00:52:16,395
My brain wants to say two, but I don't know.

885
00:52:16,395 --> 00:52:21,395
Okay girl, let's brainstorm.
Brainstorm. Fast. Yeah, 10 more seconds.

886
00:52:21,395 --> 00:52:25,395
Oh shit. You remember the first one?
When the channel got...?

887
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:27,895
The next one was the German one, right?

888
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:30,195
Wait, wait, wait. It's two.
Okay, so I think it's two.

889
00:52:30,195 --> 00:52:32,395
You're thinking it's two. Are you sure?

890
00:52:32,395 --> 00:52:32,995
Yeah.

891
00:52:32,995 --> 00:52:34,195
Oh!

892
00:52:33,295 --> 00:52:34,195
I think it's two.

893
00:52:34,195 --> 00:52:35,395
Correct answer! Yeah!

894
00:52:40,895 --> 00:52:45,595
Okay, okay. Well, I still have
one more question though.

895
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:48,395
A winner chicken dinner from the chicken.
Let's go.

896
00:52:48,395 --> 00:52:50,395
I think we're four for four so far.

897
00:52:49,895 --> 00:52:51,195
Yes we are.

898
00:52:51,195 --> 00:52:55,395
Yeah! But I guess my questions
were a little bit too easy.

899
00:52:55,395 --> 00:53:00,395
So... for the next question, you will
have to answer correctly, otherwise...

900
00:52:59,895 --> 00:53:01,995
Damn it. Is it all or nothing?

901
00:53:01,995 --> 00:53:03,695
It will be, yeah, it will be all or nothing.

902
00:53:03,195 --> 00:53:05,895
Changing the rules on us.
All right, all right.

903
00:53:05,895 --> 00:53:07,895
Can we double down? Do we get dessert too?

904
00:53:07,895 --> 00:53:10,395
Of course! Of course!

905
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,195
All right, let's do it.

906
00:53:11,195 --> 00:53:12,395
Excellent. Excellent.

907
00:53:12,395 --> 00:53:16,895
Last question. And... how should we do this?

908
00:53:16,895 --> 00:53:19,395
I want your separate answers. So...

909
00:53:19,895 --> 00:53:23,395
Huh? What happened?
Wait, she's changing the rules... okay.

910
00:53:23,395 --> 00:53:28,895
I want... no, I just want to see if you both get it right
without hearing the other's answer first.

911
00:53:28,895 --> 00:53:32,395
Okay, I'll take off my headphones.
I'm taking 'em off.

912
00:53:32,395 --> 00:53:36,895
Okay, okay. But wait, no, how do I
give you a sign that you should come back?

913
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:41,395
Whatever, just bring it back
in 30 seconds, okay?

914
00:53:38,395 --> 00:53:42,395
Okay, do like... throw up some kind
of weird hand symbol.

915
00:53:42,395 --> 00:53:43,895
Okay, I'll do this.

916
00:53:43,895 --> 00:53:45,595
Do a little heart, yeah.

917
00:53:45,595 --> 00:53:50,195
And then I'll come back. All right, bye.
I'm taking off my headphones.

918
00:53:48,695 --> 00:53:50,195
Bye-bye.

919
00:53:50,195 --> 00:53:54,395
Gawrgura. I actually have a feeling
you'll get this one right.

920
00:53:55,195 --> 00:53:56,595
Really? Oh, okay.

921
00:53:56,595 --> 00:53:59,895
Spell out for me without thinking too much.
You have to say it quickly.

922
00:53:59,895 --> 00:54:01,995
Auf Wiedersehen. Go!
Good-bye. Go!

923
00:54:01,995 --> 00:55:01,395
Spell auf wiedersehen

924
00:54:04,395 --> 00:54:06,795
Auf... A-U-F. Auf.

925
00:54:06,795 --> 00:54:08,795
A-U-F. Wiedersehen.

926
00:54:08,795 --> 00:54:11,895
V... I-E-D-E-R... Wiedersehen...

927
00:54:11,895 --> 00:54:14,395
V-I-E-D-E-R... wait...

928
00:54:14,595 --> 00:54:18,195
S-E-H-E-N... S-E-U-N... S-E-N...

929
00:54:19,395 --> 00:54:21,695
Auf Wie... A-U-F...

930
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,195
Auf is the first part.

931
00:54:23,195 --> 00:54:27,895
Wiedersehen... V-I-E-D-E-R...

932
00:54:28,395 --> 00:54:32,395
S-E-N... S-E...

933
00:54:31,695 --> 00:54:32,895
It's hard to follow.

934
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:34,595
It's hard to follow you. Final answer, go!

935
00:54:34,595 --> 00:54:36,395
A-U-F.

936
00:54:36,395 --> 00:54:37,195
Mmm-hmm.

937
00:54:37,195 --> 00:54:38,395
V...

938
00:54:39,595 --> 00:54:46,395
I-E-D-E-R-S-E-E-N.

939
00:54:46,795 --> 00:54:48,195
Wrong! Bzzzt!

940
00:54:48,195 --> 00:54:49,195
No!

941
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:53,895
Okay Calli, come back! Calli, come back!

942
00:54:52,395 --> 00:54:54,195
All I heard was wrong.

943
00:54:54,395 --> 00:54:56,195
Is it that hard of a question?
Throw it at me, Kiara.

944
00:54:56,695 --> 00:54:58,195
Throw it at me.

945
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:01,395
Now Calli recently... had...

946
00:55:02,095 --> 00:56:47,095
Spell auf wiedersehen

947
00:55:02,295 --> 00:55:04,595
A lot of fun learning German with me, so you might...

948
00:55:04,595 --> 00:55:06,295
...you might get a choice.

949
00:55:04,995 --> 00:55:06,095
Fuck.

950
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:08,095
The German question.

951
00:55:08,095 --> 00:55:08,795
Yes! Alright.

952
00:55:08,795 --> 00:55:10,395
Yeah, good luck, buddies.

953
00:55:10,395 --> 00:55:12,595
Spell, and you have to do it quickly.
Spell it, and you have to do it quickly.

954
00:55:12,595 --> 00:55:13,895
Okay? No thinking.

955
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:16,095
Spell my ending greeting...

956
00:55:16,095 --> 00:55:18,095
...Auf Wiedersehen!

957
00:55:18,095 --> 00:55:20,595
No! Stop! Don't! Ah!

958
00:55:20,595 --> 00:55:21,895
A...

959
00:55:21,895 --> 00:55:23,595
V...

960
00:55:24,095 --> 00:55:25,595
I...

961
00:55:25,595 --> 00:55:27,095
V...

962
00:55:26,595 --> 00:55:28,595
No, wait! No!

963
00:55:28,595 --> 00:55:31,095
Shit! Damn it, Gura! Come on!

964
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:32,895
Auf Wiedersehen...

965
00:55:32,895 --> 00:55:34,295
...uh...

966
00:55:34,295 --> 00:55:36,595
Oh shit, that's too hard of a question!

967
00:55:36,595 --> 00:55:39,595
I thought this was a Kiara quiz, not a spelling bee!

968
00:55:39,595 --> 00:55:42,395
Chicken!

969
00:55:42,395 --> 00:55:43,595
A, V...

970
00:55:43,595 --> 00:55:45,095
...arrivedeci...

971
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:46,295
...arrivedeci, grazie...

972
00:55:46,295 --> 00:55:47,595
...mamma mia!

973
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:48,595
Final answer?

974
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,895
A, V...

975
00:55:49,895 --> 00:55:51,095
No!

976
00:55:51,095 --> 00:55:52,595
I'll give you ten more seconds.

977
00:55:52,595 --> 00:55:53,895
Wait! No, wait, it's not arrivedeci...

978
00:55:53,895 --> 00:55:55,395
...it's Auf Wiedersehen.

979
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:57,095
A, V... bonehead!

980
00:55:57,095 --> 00:56:00,595
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!

981
00:56:00,595 --> 00:56:02,095
No!

982
00:56:02,095 --> 00:56:04,095
What the fuck?!

983
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,595
I mean, beep that out, beep that out, whoever's editing this.

984
00:56:06,595 --> 00:56:09,595
It's okay, on my channel it's allowed.

985
00:56:09,595 --> 00:56:10,595
Okay, thanks.

986
00:56:10,595 --> 00:56:12,595
Well, you know what? I said double down...

987
00:56:12,595 --> 00:56:14,595
...but I'm still gonna treat you for dinner! Yay!

988
00:56:14,595 --> 00:56:16,395
Yay! Thank you!

989
00:56:16,395 --> 00:56:18,395
Winner winner chicken dinner, from the chicken.

990
00:56:18,395 --> 00:56:21,595
As in the chicken is the dinner's from the chicken, not the dinner is the chicken.

991
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:23,095
That's right.

992
00:56:23,095 --> 00:56:25,595
It doesn't mean that the dinner is, um... is a chicken.

993
00:56:25,595 --> 00:56:28,595
It's from the chicken, so winner winner chicken...

994
00:56:28,595 --> 00:56:30,595
...I'll shut the fuck up now.

995
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:33,095
Thank you, Kiara! Happy Birthday!

996
00:56:33,095 --> 00:56:34,395
Thank you! I'll bring the cakes soon!

997
00:56:34,395 --> 00:56:36,095
Wait, what's the answer?

998
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,595
You can't just leave us hanging!

999
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:38,595
Oh, okay. It's A-U-F...

1000
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:39,395
Yeah, spell it!

1001
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:41,095
...space, W-...

1002
00:56:41,095 --> 00:56:43,395
...I-E-D-E-R...

1003
00:56:42,595 --> 00:56:44,595
Ah, fuck!

1004
00:56:44,595 --> 00:56:47,395
...S-E-H-E-N!

1005
00:56:47,395 --> 00:56:50,095
Oh, Auf Wiedersehen.

1006
00:56:50,095 --> 00:56:52,095
I'm gonna start saying that from now on. Auf Wiedersehen.

1007
00:56:52,095 --> 00:56:54,595
And perfectly, since I just spelled it out...

Yay yay yay! That was Heart Challenger! Woo!

1086
01:02:12,579 --> 01:02:16,079
Remember, a while ago at Dokomi...

1087
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,579
...where I had backup dancers who were doing the dancing for me?

1088
01:02:19,579 --> 01:02:24,579
And now I learned it myself and performed it myself. Yay!

1089
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:27,579
That was fun. Hope you enjoyed that.

1090
01:02:27,579 --> 01:02:31,579
Well, you know, if you look at the time, you might think, "Oh, it's gonna be over soon."

1091
01:02:31,579 --> 01:02:34,579
And yeah, there is one more song.

1092
01:02:34,579 --> 01:02:37,579
But before that, let me say a few words to you guys.

1093
01:02:37,579 --> 01:02:41,579
So, yeah, we're getting close to the end...

1094
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:45,579
...and I wanted to do something like this for a long time, as you probably know.

1095
01:02:45,579 --> 01:02:49,579
And I wanted to show off my dance moves for so long...

1096
01:02:49,579 --> 01:02:53,579
...which is, it's one of my, I guess, most prominent skills.

1097
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:57,579
And it has been my dream since the start to show it off...

1098
01:02:57,579 --> 01:03:01,579
...to get into this 3D body, finally be free to do whatever I want.

1099
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:04,579
Yeah, and today has finally come.

1100
01:03:04,579 --> 01:03:07,579
I hope you guys enjoyed it so far. Yeah.

1101
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:13,579
I want to definitely say a big thanks to Ame and Ina and Gura for helping so much...

1102
01:03:13,579 --> 01:03:16,579
...with the recording and the setup.

1103
01:03:16,579 --> 01:03:19,579
You know, Ame basically built a whole studio...

1104
01:03:19,579 --> 01:03:23,579
...for me to record this in...

1105
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:26,579
...and I really, really, really appreciate that.

1106
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:30,579
And without her, it wouldn't have been possible at all.

1107
01:03:30,579 --> 01:03:35,579
And also big thanks to Kanauru for putting together all of this into a proper concert...

1108
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:39,579
...and even creating this beautiful stage here.

1109
01:03:39,579 --> 01:03:42,579
Wow! Look, isn't it nice? Yeah.

1110
01:03:42,579 --> 01:03:46,579
Thank you so much!

1111
01:03:46,579 --> 01:03:50,579
In the future, I really hope that I can do more like this, more often...

1112
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:53,579
...and get more members to join me in 3D...

1113
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:57,579
...if possible, to dance together. Yeah.

1114
01:03:57,579 --> 01:04:01,579
Especially, you know, Myth and Holotori and EN as a whole...

1115
01:04:01,579 --> 01:04:07,579
...with all of them I want to dance and, yeah, have fun together.

1116
01:04:07,579 --> 01:04:12,579
And I think we're getting there, slowly but surely.

1117
01:04:12,579 --> 01:04:16,079
By the way, if you missed it, the birthday merchandise was announced...

1118
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:19,579
...it was announced in the previous stream...

1119
01:04:19,579 --> 01:04:22,579
...before this one, the countdown stream...

1120
01:04:22,579 --> 01:04:26,579
...and it's linked in the description.

1121
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:29,579
So please go check it out if you're interested.

1122
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:31,579
And yeah, last but not least, I want to thank KFP.

1123
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:35,079
You know how much I appreciate your support...

1124
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:38,579
...and you believing in me and trusting in me means the world to me.

1125
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:43,079
So thank you for giving me the strength...

1126
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:47,579
...in a very, very, very stressful period leading up to this day.

1127
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:50,079
Yeah, I think it was worth it. Yeah.

1128
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:52,579
So thank you for waiting for me.

1129
01:04:52,579 --> 01:04:55,579
And I will continue working hard...

1130
01:04:55,579 --> 01:04:59,579
...to give back to you as much as I can.

1131
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:02,079
Please continue supporting me...

1132
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:04,079
...and watch me grow into a bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger Phoenix!

1133
01:05:05,293 --> 01:05:06,218
And I want to thank,

1134
01:05:06,298 --> 01:05:08,458
but I will do that with a song.

1135
01:05:09,058 --> 01:05:10,498
So please listen to that.

1136
01:05:10,578 --> 01:05:11,738
Last song.

1137
01:05:12,098 --> 01:05:13,538

How much more do I have to shout?

1145
01:05:54,498 --> 01:05:59,498
あとどれだけ泣けばいいんだろう
How much more do I have to cry?

1146
01:06:00,218 --> 01:06:03,418

The tears I've held back are about to overflow

1161
