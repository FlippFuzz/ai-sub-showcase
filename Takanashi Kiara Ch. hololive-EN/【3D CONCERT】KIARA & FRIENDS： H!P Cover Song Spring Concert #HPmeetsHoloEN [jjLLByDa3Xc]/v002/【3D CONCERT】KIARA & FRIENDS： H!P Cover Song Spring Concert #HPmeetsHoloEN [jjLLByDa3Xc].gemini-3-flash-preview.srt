Did you enjoy that?

54
00:08:42,508 --> 00:08:46,208
Hello everybody, welcome! I am Takanashi Kiara from Hololive English -Myth-

55
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:51,208
and I welcome you to my very special Hello! Project cover song

56
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,508
Kiara & Friends: Spring Concert!

57
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:56,508
Woohoo! Yay!

58
00:08:56,508 --> 00:09:01,008
Yes! And it is Hello! Project themed. Do you know what Hello! Project is?

59
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:05,208
Ah, I used to go to so many Hello! Project concerts back in the day.

60
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:12,508
I love Hello! Project, it's an idol agency that has several different groups like Morning Musume, Berryz Kobo, °C-ute,

61
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:16,208
and so many more! So today, I will introduce all of them to you.

62
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:21,508
Yay! And don't forget to use the hashtag #HPmeetsHoloEN so that I can look at your screenshots

63
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:28,508
and everybody gets to know even if they missed the livestream, you can maybe tell them to watch the VOD. Yay, yay, yay!

64
00:09:29,508 --> 00:09:31,508
And so I kicked things off with the legendary

65
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:36,208
“Romantic Ukare Mode” (Romantic High-Spirits Mode)

66
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:41,508
by Fujimoto Miki-san, who is... oh, she wrote history! You don't even understand.

67
00:09:42,508 --> 00:09:46,008
She's a Hello! Project idol legend!

68
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:50,508
So I hope that came across a little bit. Of course I'm not on her level, but you know, you know.

69
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:56,208
Okay, so besides performing many, many, many Hello! Project songs,

70
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:59,008
we'll also be having as many Hololive English members...

71
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,816
...as possible.

72
00:10:01,816 --> 00:10:05,116
And that might even mean that we get a member...

73
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:07,516
...who you haven't seen...

74
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:10,516
...in a long, long time!

75
00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:15,516
You already know, don't you?

76
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,516
Yes, and also we have flower crowns...

77
00:10:18,516 --> 00:10:20,516
...as you can maybe tell.

78
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:22,516
Pretty, pretty, wow.

79
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:24,516
We have these yellow ones...

80
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:26,516
...but who knows, maybe we'll have...

81
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:28,516
...some other colors too...

82
00:10:28,516 --> 00:10:30,516
...because Hello Project also means...

83
00:10:30,516 --> 00:10:32,516
...many different colors, image colors...

84
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:34,516
...and personalities...

85
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:36,516
...and we're gonna show them with these flowers.

86
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:38,216
And one more thing, the stage.

87
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:40,816
Let's give an applause for the stage!

88
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:43,016
Woohoo, the stage!

89
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:45,016
Thank you for coming, you cutie-pooties!

90
00:10:45,316 --> 00:10:47,316
Are you excited for a big concert...

91
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:50,016
...out here in this outdoor square?

92
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,516
Yay yay yay yay!

93
00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:54,816
All right, then let's jump right into it.

94
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:57,016
Everybody, let's have a great time!

95
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:59,016

We cry, we laugh,

いろんな人に
And we meet all kinds of...

164
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,324

240
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:21,832

248
00:24:36,698 --> 00:24:41,332
もうすぐ 引っ越しするでしょ
You're moving soon, aren't you?

249
00:24:41,432 --> 00:24:45,698
これ以上 優しくしないで
Don't be any kinder than this

250
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:49,865
嘘泣きして あげるから
Because I'll give you a fake cry

251
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,240
Ehh! Teggan!

252
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,540
Who would've thought? This is just how it goes here.

253
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,540
Bye bye girls!

254
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,540
Well that was our next big part,

255
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,040
the first half or so of the nice super awesome special guest segment!

256
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,540
The first song was... Gachinko de Ikou!

257
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,540
It was performed with... people and...

258
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,040
I want to hear you in the chat!

259
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,540
Ame! Ame!

260
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,040
That's right, yeah, I managed to finally get Ame back for a performance.

261
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,540
And if anyone would make that happen, you know it would be

262
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,540
number one teammate Takanashi Kiara, right? Of course it was.

263
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,040
Ah, I miss her already.

264
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,540
The song was from Buono!, which is a special unit that came together with

265
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,540
two members of Berryz Kobo and one from ℃-ute. Yes,

266
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,040
they're so awesome, they're so legendary.

267
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,040
Speaking of Berryz Kobo, after that came Watashi no Mirai no Dannasama

268
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,040
with special guests Ina, Ina, Ina

269
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,540
and Nerissa, the super tall one!

270
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,540
That song is one of my favorite songs from Berryz Kobo,

271
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:36,040
and it's about finding the ideal 'husbando'. 'Husband', Dannasama is husband.

272
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,040
The height difference from Ina and Nerissa was kind of crazy in that one.

273
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Is that what they call a moe gap?

274
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,040
I think so.

275
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,040
And then we had Amanojaku performed by our guest Ina again

276
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,040
and Fuwawa and Mococo. Together they are FuwaMoco!

277
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,040
Bau bau bau bau! Yeah!

278
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,540
It's from another one of my favorite idol groups from Hello! Project called S/mileage.

279
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,040
They were made up of four members, but they quickly had some graduations

280
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:11,040
and added many members, and they have since been renamed to ANGERME.

281
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,040
Amanojaku was actually their debut song, so it's super sweet and innocent.

282
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,540
Fitting these members that we had, right?

283
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,540
I agree too.

284
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,540
Next up is another song, but let's head over to a new place.

285
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,040
The one up there. We shall go in there, okay?

286
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,040
Will you follow me?

287
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,540
Okay, I'll take the way around, I won't go directly,

288
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,040
I'll go there. Okay.

289
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,040
Follow me! Bye bye!

290
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,040
なんちゃって恋愛
Lyrics, Music: Tsunku Arrangement: Okubo Kaoru
Nanchatte Ren'ai (Just Kidding Romance)
Lyrics, Music: Tsunku Arrangement: Kaoru Okubo

291
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,040
あくびが一つ出ちゃうほど
So much so that a yawn escapes me

292
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,540
つまらない午後になったな
It's become a boring afternoon

293
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,540
ナンパとかしなきゃいられぬかな
Do I have to go out and flirt or something?

294
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,540
シラケちゃう
It's a real buzzkill

295
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,540
しばらくは元気なキャラで
For a while, I've lived with a cheerful persona

296
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:52,040
なんとなく生きてきたけど
And somehow managed to get by

297
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:56,540
気が付けば色気も出てきてるみたい
Before I knew it, I seem to have developed some sexiness

298
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,540
みたい
Or so it seems

299
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,540
ああだのこうだの私
With "this and that", I...

300
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,540
言うことが足りないたび
Every time words fail me

301
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,540
泣きたい気持ちになる ハハッ
I feel like crying, haha

302
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,540
Oh baby 夢も全部真剣だから
Oh baby, because even my dreams are serious

303
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,540
大人になる条件を 教えてほしい
I want you to tell me the requirements for becoming an adult

304
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,040
だけどなんだかめんどくさい
But somehow it's a bit of a hassle

305
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:24,040
そのうちテレビを買い替えないと いけないね
Before long, I'll have to buy a new TV, won't I?

306
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,040
なんちゃって恋愛をしたとこで
Even if I have a "just kidding" romance

307
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,040
寂しくなるだけ
It'll just make me lonely

308
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,040
それなのにぬくもりを 感じたくなる
And yet, I still want to feel some warmth

309
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,540
なんちゃっていい奴を演じても
Even if I act like a "just kidding" nice person

310
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,040
虚しくなるだけ
It'll just leave me empty

311
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,540
それなのに適当に 愛想笑い
And yet, I still give a half-hearted fake smile

312
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,840
ハンバーガー かじりながら
While biting into a hamburger

313
00:30:01,288 --> 00:30:04,328
街行く人を眺めてた
I was watching the people passing by.

314
00:30:04,328 --> 00:30:07,548
本当に笑い合ってる子なんて
I wonder if there are any girls

315
00:30:07,548 --> 00:30:11,208
いるのかしら...
who are truly laughing together...

316
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:15,408
ヘッドホンから流れてる
Flowing from my headphones,

317
00:30:15,408 --> 00:30:19,448
お気に入りの曲が繰り返し
my favorite song repeats over and over.

318
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:26,528
この歌詞は私のこと歌ってる...
These lyrics are singing about me...

319
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:30,848
望んだのと私 素直にはまれない
I can't honestly get into what I hoped for.

320
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:34,048
誰にでも合わせたい hah-ha
I want to fit in with everyone, hah-ha.

321
00:30:35,448 --> 00:30:38,968
Oh Baby 明日何にするの私 何を求めてるの ah-yeah
Oh Baby, what am I doing tomorrow? What am I looking for? ah-yeah.

322
00:30:38,968 --> 00:30:42,568
愛が足りない
Love is not enough.

323
00:30:42,568 --> 00:30:46,928
だけど意味なく群れたりしない だってそんなの勿体ない You know
But I don't hang out aimlessly, because that's just a waste of time, you know.

324
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,408
愛したい
I want to love.

325
00:30:50,408 --> 00:30:54,008
なんちゃって恋愛を繰り返す 女の子の気持ち
The feelings of a girl repeating make-believe romances.

326
00:30:54,008 --> 00:30:57,648
誰にでも分かっちゃうわ 女の子なら
Any girl would understand.

327
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:01,248
なんちゃって色々と言うけれど 輝きたいだけ
I say all these things, but I just want to shine.

328
00:31:01,248 --> 00:31:05,168
私でもなれるかしら 本物に...
I wonder if I can become the real thing...

329
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:28,968
なんちゃって恋愛をしたとこで 寂しくなるだけ
Even if I have a make-believe romance, it just makes me lonely.

330
00:31:28,968 --> 00:31:32,448
それなのに温もりを 感じたくなる
And yet, I still want to feel warmth.

331
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:36,448
なんちゃっていい奴を演じても 虚しくなるだけ
Even if I pretend to be a 'nice person', it just feels empty.

332
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:40,048
それなのに適当に 愛されたい
And yet, I want to be loved in a casual way.

333
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:43,728
なんちゃって恋愛を繰り返す 女の子の気持ち
The feelings of a girl repeating make-believe romances.

334
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:47,328
誰にでも分かっちゃうわ 女の子なら
Any girl would understand.

335
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:50,968
なんちゃって色々と言うけれど 輝きたいだけ
I say all these things, but I just want to shine.

336
00:31:50,968 --> 00:31:55,008
私でもなれるかしら 本物に
I wonder if I can become the real thing.

337
00:32:56,168 --> 00:33:07,548
Independent Girl ～独立女子であるために～
Independent Girl ~To Be an Independent Woman~

338
00:33:08,568 --> 00:33:12,548
目を覚ましてよ そんな涙を
Wake up! The one who made you shed

339
00:33:12,548 --> 00:33:15,528
流させたのは 彼なんて
those tears is just some guy.

340
00:33:15,528 --> 00:33:19,248
あなたのことを 愛していたら
If he really loved you,

341
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:22,968
きっとひどい事 できないはずでしょ
surely he wouldn't be able to do such a terrible thing.

342
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:26,248
おかしいよ 気付かないうち
It's strange. Before you know it,

343
00:33:26,248 --> 00:33:29,448
人に振り回されちゃって
you're being jerked around by others.

344
00:33:29,448 --> 00:33:33,248
服のセンスとか 髪の色まで
From your sense of fashion to the color of your hair,

345
00:33:33,248 --> 00:33:37,008
誰かの言いなりになってる
you're doing whatever someone else tells you.

346
00:33:37,008 --> 00:33:40,548
恋は盲目っていうよ
They say love is blind.

347
00:33:40,548 --> 00:33:44,208
バッドメディシンみたいなもんよ
It's like a bad medicine.

348
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:47,848
本当の愛はそんな
Real love isn't

349
00:33:47,848 --> 00:33:51,528
辛くなんかないやいやい
painful like that at all.

350
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:55,048
Independent Girl じゃなきゃダメさ
You've got to be an Independent Girl.

351
00:33:55,048 --> 00:33:58,528
Ah-ah 声を聞かせてよ
Ah-ah, let me hear your voice.

352
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:02,548
誰かのものなんかじゃないんだ
We're not someone else's property.

Girl じゃなきゃダメさ
You've got to be a Girl.

355
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:12,528
Ah-ah こっちを向いてよ
Ah-ah, look over here.

356
00:34:12,528 --> 00:34:16,248
自分の生き方くらい
Try deciding your own way of life

357
00:34:16,248 --> 00:34:20,008
自分で決めてみなよ
by yourself.

358
00:34:33,528 --> 00:34:37,048
ニコニコ笑う 馬鹿な女に
For you, who has stooped down to being

359
00:34:37,048 --> 00:34:40,448
成り下がってる あなたなんて
a foolish woman who just smiles and nods...

360
00:34:40,448 --> 00:34:44,248
本当のあなた なんかじゃないわ
...that's not the real you.

361
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,968
早く現実に 気付いて
Realize the truth soon.

362
00:34:47,968 --> 00:34:51,548
携帯 やたらにチェックされて
Your phone is checked all the time,

363
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:55,168
身動き取れない毎日
every day you can't even move freely.

364
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:59,368
まるで奴隷みたいよ 悲しい...
You're like a slave. It's sad...

365
00:35:00,056 --> 00:36:52,056
Independent Girl ~独立女子であるために~

378
00:36:54,056 --> 00:36:56,056
Yay!

I got the memo. Yatta!
I got the memo. I did it!

380
00:36:59,156 --> 00:37:01,056
Hello! O-yay!

381
00:37:01,556 --> 00:37:04,056
私達 Independent Girls です！
We are the Independent Girls!

382
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:06,556
Yeah, we're the independent joshi! Yeah, that's right!
Yeah, we're the independent girls! Yeah, that's right!

383
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:11,556
Okay, let me please let me hear some introductions. How about we start with my senpai...

384
00:37:12,056 --> 00:37:15,556
...my once senpai? How... how much of a senpai are you?

385
00:37:16,056 --> 00:37:18,556
I'm your senpai by one stream.

386
00:37:19,056 --> 00:37:22,056
It's like we're twins, you know? Who's born first?

387
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,556
True, that's a good point. Okay, I guess that would be me.

388
00:37:25,056 --> 00:37:33,556
Minasan, it's me, Mori Calliope, Hololive English's rapping reaper singer-songwriter. Hello everybody!
Everyone, it's me, Mori Calliope, Hololive English's rapping reaper singer-songwriter. Hello everybody!

389
00:37:33,656 --> 00:37:35,056
If you don't know me, now you do. Who's next?

390
00:37:37,056 --> 00:37:39,556
Ah, the kouhai IRyS-pon here? Okay then.
Ah, the junior IRyS-pon here? Okay then.

391
00:37:40,056 --> 00:37:44,556
IRyS! It's IRyS from Hololive English: Project HOPE's stays-at-home Nephilim...

392
00:37:44,656 --> 00:37:49,056
...here to bring hope to this world and to Kiara.

393
00:37:49,156 --> 00:37:52,556
Oh, the hope of all of us! Kouhai IRyS! Welcome!
Oh, the hope of all of us! Junior IRyS! Welcome!

394
00:37:53,556 --> 00:37:59,056
Well girls, we have just performed 'Independent Girl ~独立女子であるために~'...
Well girls, we have just performed 'Independent Girl ~To be an Independent Girl~'...

395
00:37:59,156 --> 00:38:01,556
...by Buono! My Buono! It's a long title.

396
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:05,556
Dokuritsu Joshi! Dokuritsu Joshi.
Independent girls! Independent girls.

397
00:38:06,056 --> 00:38:10,556
And we're now inside, by the way. We're in the building that was behind previously.

398
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:14,056
It's so dark! It's like a planetarium. Pretty! Okay.

399
00:38:14,556 --> 00:38:18,056
You can move in here with me if you want to! Wanna? Wanna?

400
00:38:18,156 --> 00:38:20,556
Sure. I kind of want to go for a walk outside. A walk outside?

401
00:38:21,056 --> 00:38:25,556
Maybe not, because don't we want to be independent girls? Why would we live together?

402
00:38:25,656 --> 00:38:26,556
That's true.

403
00:38:26,656 --> 00:38:30,556
Speaking of that, come back, independent ladies! Trying to be an independent girl, I don't know.

404
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:35,556
I want to ask you girls something. What makes you such an independent girl?

405
00:38:36,056 --> 00:38:41,056
Oh, such a great cue. I didn't have time to prepare for this at all.

406
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:47,556
For Mori, I always was playing alone by myself at the playground. Beyond that, I had to...

407
00:38:48,056 --> 00:38:51,056
Yeah, yeah, I had no friends. Oh, no friends?

408
00:38:51,556 --> 00:38:55,556
Now too. You go to the playground? Oh, I mean, I kind of feel like...

409
00:38:55,656 --> 00:38:59,056
...have you seen the park outside? It's so lovely. That's true.

410
00:38:59,156 --> 00:39:03,556
No, for me, the main reason I think I'm an independent girl is because I do a lot of music stuff on my own.

411
00:39:03,656 --> 00:39:07,556
So I write my own songs and stuff like that. Yeah, and do a lot of things myself.

412
00:39:07,656 --> 00:39:10,556
So I feel like that's something an independent person has to do.

413
00:39:11,056 --> 00:39:13,556
I count that. Yes. Build bit of a lone wolf.

414
00:39:13,656 --> 00:39:17,556
Yeah, what about you? How are you independent? I would say...

415
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:22,556
...well, it's many things. Like for example, since last year, I own a home!

416
00:39:22,656 --> 00:39:26,556
おめでとう！ But that might make some people cry right now, it's too depressing.
Congratulations! But that might make some people cry right now, it's too depressing.

417
00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:31,556
Uh, but yeah, also having my own babies, aka my cats. She's a mom!

418
00:39:32,056 --> 00:39:36,556
But anyway, I want to hear why IRyS is independent. Or is she not very independent at all?

419
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:40,056
Independent? あらあら！
Independent? Oh my goodness!

420
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:46,556
Independent? What makes you not independent, IRyS? Maybe we can fix it.

421
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:52,556
I... I can't open water... I can open water bottles by myself if I try really hard.

422
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:59,056
I can wake up with... with multiple alarms. I... I can... I can...

423
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:01,864
...stuff. Does it- has it turned out we sang this song to IRyS?

424
00:40:03,464 --> 00:40:05,164
You have to be independent IRyS.

425
00:40:05,164 --> 00:40:06,064
Teaching her a lesson.

426
00:40:07,464 --> 00:40:10,564
I am so independent. I did not have my

427
00:40:10,564 --> 00:40:13,264
manager feed me medicine right before this.

428
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:14,864
I saw that! I saw that!

429
00:40:14,564 --> 00:40:15,564
I saw that. I heard it.

430
00:40:15,564 --> 00:40:18,964
And you were like, "Can you put it right into-"

431
00:40:18,964 --> 00:40:20,264
We believe you.

432
00:40:20,264 --> 00:40:21,864
That sounds weird. Oh my god.

433
00:40:21,864 --> 00:40:24,264
Anyway, we will continue teaching her some

434
00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:26,564
lessons about independence, right? Okay.

435
00:40:26,564 --> 00:40:30,064
She can't be independent for now though, so we're
going to go for a walk in the forest together.

436
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:31,964
Take me! Take me independent girl!

437
00:40:31,964 --> 00:40:33,264
Okay, I'll take you.

438
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,964
Thanks for the invite, Kiara! It's been fun!

439
00:40:34,964 --> 00:40:37,464
Bye bye! I'll teach you the ways.

440
00:40:37,464 --> 00:40:39,964
Alright, come on IRyS, we're going to
go for a walk now.

441
00:40:39,964 --> 00:40:41,464
Oh my god. Bye bye!

442
00:40:42,164 --> 00:40:45,664
Yeah. Well, that was independent girls right there.

443
00:40:46,064 --> 00:40:47,864
But going on, moving on,

444
00:40:48,164 --> 00:40:50,864
I think I'll put my microphone away so I can

445
00:40:50,864 --> 00:40:52,464
have a little bit more freedom with my arms

446
00:40:52,464 --> 00:40:54,664
and maybe I'll attach some LEDs to this outfit.

447
00:40:54,664 --> 00:40:56,864
Got to switch some batteries.

448
00:40:56,864 --> 00:40:58,564
So, I'll see you in a minute!

449
00:41:31,664 --> 00:41:35,364
Love take it all
Lyrics, Music: つんく♂
Love take it all
Lyrics, Music: Tsunku♂

450
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:42,214
思い出したくない 恋もしてきたわ
I've been in loves I don't want to remember

451
00:41:43,764 --> 00:41:48,114
若気の至りってやつね
The rashness of youth, you know?

452
00:41:50,114 --> 00:41:55,814
それでも後悔は しないのが私流
Even so, not having regrets is my style

453
00:41:56,614 --> 00:42:00,914
自分が生きてきた道だから
Because it's the path I've walked

454
00:42:03,414 --> 00:42:08,614
嘘をついてまでして 体裁取り繕って
Going so far as to lie to keep up appearances

455
00:42:09,214 --> 00:42:13,714
逆に疲れないんだろうか
Don't you just get tired instead?

456
00:42:16,214 --> 00:42:22,114
夢が 夢が 夢が 弾む
Dreams, dreams, dreams are bouncing

457
00:42:22,814 --> 00:42:27,314
このまま引き下がらない
I won't back down like this

458
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:34,614
次の扉開けば 未来が見える
If I open the next door, I can see the future

459
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:41,114
ほら シンプルなキスくらいじゃ ごまかされないよ
Look, I won't be fooled by just a simple kiss

460
00:42:42,214 --> 00:42:47,614
次のチャンス掴めば さらなるチャンス
If I grab the next chance, even more chances

461
00:42:48,514 --> 00:42:54,314
ほら 複雑な青春の 糸を解すように
Look, like untangling the threads of complex youth

462
00:42:56,114 --> 00:43:00,114
Love take it all

463
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:08,714

確かに格好いいよね　話しかけちゃおうかな
He's certainly cool, maybe I'll talk to him.

503

00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,380
And we are... JUSTICE!

529
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,980
JUSTICE!

530
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,080
JUSTICE!

531
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,580
Just like that!

532
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,680
JUSTICE!

00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,980
GET THAT!

534
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,080
JUSTICE!

535
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,080
Okay, JUSTICE! You girls will have to work a little bit more on your sync...

536
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,580
...but besides that, beautiful!

537
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,280
Yeah! Yeah, man!

538
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,580
So, we just had a beautiful song, a little bit of a performance together.

539
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:48,080
It was like your first time in, like, 3D cardboard.

540
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,580
Yeah! I'm so happy to be 2D!

541
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,880
I think our dancing was a bit flat.

542
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,080
It was beautiful! Sometimes you gotta get on the floor, you already have that down.

543
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,580
So, we sang "Seishun Collection" from Morning Musume.

544
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,580
And as you noticed in the beginning of the song, we had some messages lying there...

545
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,580
...that were written by these cutie-patooties.

546
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,080
So let's have a little bit of a look at those messages, shall we?

547
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,080
I'm gonna get mine.

548
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,080
Yay! Let's look! Let's look!

549
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,080
Okay, so I'll start with introducing my message.

550
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:34,080
Love, unconditionally. Thanks for coming! by Wawa

551
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,580
Mine's a bit more generic or something, I don't know, this is not really towards anybody.

552
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,580
But it says: "Love, unconditionally. Thanks for coming!"

553
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:34,580
...By Wawa." Yay!

554
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,380
Yay! Kawaii!

555
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,580
And now, please, in your usual order, tell me about your message and what you wrote on it.

556
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:48,580
Oh, I wrote "Love You!" to Kiwawa, and then these little flowers around it...

557
00:51:46,680 --> 00:52:00,080
Love You! -Liz

558
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,080
...to represent us as JUSTICE.

559
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,080
Because, yeah, we love everyone. Yay! Wow!

560
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,280
Aww, so cute!

561
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:02,080
I'm so happy we could be part of your song. Thank you.

562
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,580
Thank you!

563
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,380
All right, what else have we got? Who's next?

564
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:10,080
Mine says "OTSUKARE KIWAWA!!" because you worked so hard.

565
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:18,080
LOVE OTSUKARE KIWAWA!! I love you too

566
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:14,580
And I'm happy to be here. And L-O-V-E! I love you too!

567
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,080
Cute! And who else? What else do we have?

568
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:25,280
I wrote mine in German! I wrote "Vielen Dank! Kiara-Senpai!"

569
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:32,080
Vielen Dank! Kiara-Senpai! Hab dich lieb! Cecilia

"Hab dich lieb!"
"Love you!"

571
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,880
Yay! And last but not least?

572
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:37,580
I wrote mine in Italian for you! "Ti amo Kiara!"
I wrote mine in Italian for you! "I love you, Kiara!"

Thank you for taking my first time.

578
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,380
Yeah, all on stream. It was so much fun.

579
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,580
And with that, unfortunately, I have to already send you out because we got some stuff to do.

580
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,580
What?

581
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,280
Thank you JUSTICE so much for coming!

582
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:08,080
No problem! Thank you Kiara! Next time in 3D! Bye bye!

00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:34,488
流しちゃえばいいじゃん

00:58:13,388 --> 00:58:15,588
You gotta do it like

652
00:58:31,288 --> 00:58:32,988

653
00:58:33,288 --> 00:58:35,088
Feel the rhythm, call me on my bluff

654
00:58:35,288 --> 00:58:38,288
Can't die no not this way [no~]

655
00:58:39,188 --> 00:58:42,188
Hopeless girl, haven't I had enough?

00:58:42,588 --> 00:58:44,288
N-no-no-no

657
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:46,388
Cause I'm a shinin' diamond

658
00:58:46,488 --> 00:58:48,088
From nothin to brilliant, oh my

659
00:58:49,288 --> 00:58:51,088

With a shade of violet

662
00:58:54,888 --> 00:58:56,588

I never could define what I could be so I

673
00:59:24,888 --> 00:59:27,288
Went on a broken dreamer

674
00:59:27,488 --> 00:59:30,988
Uh, puttin' every piece of me back, I'm free

675
00:59:31,188 --> 00:59:34,388
Spent so much time just waiting, crying [Crying]

676
00:59:34,588 --> 00:59:35,388
Why [Why]

677
00:59:35,588 --> 00:59:39,188
But would you be born if you weren't meant for somethin' greater, baby?

678
00:59:39,388 --> 00:59:41,588
Good [Good], bye [Bye]

679
00:59:41,788 --> 00:59:44,788
Bye sixteen, these years have flown by really

680
00:59:44,988 --> 00:59:46,488
Shinin' diamond

681
00:59:46,588 --> 00:59:48,188
From nothin to brilliant, oh my

682
00:59:49,388 --> 00:59:51,188
Oh I do it casually

683
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:52,988
Levelin' me up

684
00:59:53,088 --> 00:59:54,688
With a shade of violet

00:59:56,688 --> 00:59:57,188

00:59:57,288 --> 01:00:00,088

Got that perfume on ~

01:00:09,096 --> 01:00:11,896
I-I-I still feel those

692
01:00:11,896 --> 01:00:14,896
Sinking thoughts, reckless emotions

693
01:00:14,996 --> 01:00:17,696
I-I-I know there's

694
01:00:17,796 --> 01:00:20,596
No closed door I can't open

695
01:00:20,696 --> 01:00:23,796
[Girl, girl, girls so perfect]

696
01:00:23,896 --> 01:00:26,596
[Don't don't don't don't doubt it]

697
01:00:26,696 --> 01:00:29,896
[Girl, girl, girls so perfect]

698
01:00:30,596 --> 01:00:32,496
On me

699
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:35,896
Put that lipstick on me [stick on me]

700
01:00:35,996 --> 01:00:38,296
Oh a new improved girl, my -

701
01:00:38,396 --> 01:00:41,896
Perfume, that's what I need, what I need

702
01:00:41,996 --> 01:00:44,796
Got that perfume on ~

703
01:00:44,896 --> 01:00:47,796
Got that perfu-fume-fume on me

704
01:00:47,896 --> 01:00:50,896
Got that per-per fume-fume on you

705
01:00:50,996 --> 01:00:53,796
Got that perfu-fume-fume on me

706
01:00:53,896 --> 01:00:58,096
Got that perfume on me, on me

707
01:01:10,596 --> 01:01:12,896
Wee!

708
01:01:12,996 --> 01:01:15,896
Yippee! That was my new song!

709
01:01:15,996 --> 01:01:18,496
But before that, before we go into that, I shall explain.

710
01:01:18,596 --> 01:01:21,096
Before the new song, we had...

711
01:01:21,196 --> 01:01:24,096
...one of my favorite songs from my favorite idol group Berryz Kobo...

712
01:01:24,196 --> 01:01:26,096
...'RIVAL', which you know...

713
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:29,296
...that had a really awesome formation, right? It was so fun with like...

714
01:01:29,396 --> 01:01:33,496
...turning around in like different timings and everything.

715
01:01:34,096 --> 01:01:37,096
Really difficult, but really fun, and I think it will look beautiful to you guys. I hope so!

716
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:43,096
Well, besides that...

717
01:01:43,196 --> 01:01:48,096
another song with many members, or members, many people in one place...

718
01:01:48,196 --> 01:01:50,896
...was my new song, PERFUME!

719
01:01:50,996 --> 01:01:54,096
Yay, yay, yay, yay!

720
01:01:54,196 --> 01:01:56,896
It will be released today!

721
01:01:56,996 --> 01:02:00,096
And the jacket is here! Ta-da!

722
01:02:00,196 --> 01:02:03,596
Wah wah wah!

723
01:02:03,696 --> 01:02:06,096
Kind of like... it is... I wanted it to be like this...

724
01:02:06,196 --> 01:02:09,596
...so it doesn't give away any hint of anime or so. It's just a perfume.

725
01:02:11,596 --> 01:02:13,596
I wonder what smell it is.

726
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:15,596
Hmm, here.

727
01:02:15,696 --> 01:02:18,096
Here, smell my armpits.

728
01:02:18,196 --> 01:02:20,596
Then you will find out. Ah, stinky! Ah!

729
01:02:21,096 --> 01:02:23,096
Okay, well, that's Perfume.

730
01:02:23,196 --> 01:02:26,596
Yeah, and the music video will also come out after this.

731
01:02:26,696 --> 01:02:30,096
The premiere, you may have already seen that it's up.

732
01:02:30,196 --> 01:02:34,596
It's about to begin anytime soon, so be ready for it. It's gonna be really beautiful again...

733
01:02:34,696 --> 01:02:38,596
...with different new 3D outfits, maybe perhaps one that I designed as well.

734
01:02:39,096 --> 01:02:45,096
And maybe one that Ora-da designed. Yeah!

735
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:48,596
That's right, giving away all the secrets already now.

736
01:02:49,096 --> 01:02:51,596
Okay, well...

737
01:02:51,696 --> 01:02:54,596
...yeah, I hope you really enjoyed it. It was really tough, Perfume practice.

738
01:02:54,696 --> 01:02:58,596
I practiced so much on it, and if you maybe noticed, I had even more back dancers than last time.

739
01:02:58,696 --> 01:03:02,096
Last time was four...

740
01:03:02,196 --> 01:03:05,596
...and I was the fifth one, was I? And now it's six...

741
01:03:05,696 --> 01:03:08,596
...and I'm the seventh one.

742
01:03:08,696 --> 01:03:13,596
So I wanted things to look even more complicated and more interesting.

743
01:03:13,696 --> 01:03:17,596
I hope I managed to do that, and I hope you liked it.

744
01:03:18,096 --> 01:03:22,596
And that was the only song today that is not Hello! Project.

745
01:03:22,696 --> 01:03:27,596
And even though probably usually makes more sense for me to end it on my new original song...

746
01:03:27,696 --> 01:03:30,596
...since this is all Hello! Project themed...

747
01:03:30,696 --> 01:03:34,596
...we will still end it with one more song...

748
01:03:34,696 --> 01:03:38,596
...with a Hello! Project song, one of my favorite ones from ℃-ute.

749
01:03:38,696 --> 01:03:41,596
And it's called 'Bye Bye Bye'.

750
01:03:41,696 --> 01:03:45,596
So to you I also say: Bye Bye Bye! Thank you for watching!

751
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:48,596
Enjoy the last song!

752
01:03:48,696 --> 01:03:50,096
Woo!

753
01:04:12,396 --> 01:04:15,596
勝手なイメージ 決めつけないで
Don't judge me with your selfish image

754
01:04:15,696 --> 01:04:19,596
確信を見てよ get it on
Look at the certainty, get it on

755
01:04:19,696 --> 01:04:23,596
それでも私は 噂をされても
Even so, even if there are rumors about me

756
01:04:23,696 --> 01:04:27,396
そんなの気にせず on my way
I won't care and go on my way

757
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:30,596

759
01:04:38,796 --> 01:04:41,596
言葉で認めちゃって
Admit it with words

760
01:04:41,696 --> 01:04:45,096
心の中じゃダメダメ
It's no good just in your heart

761
01:04:45,196 --> 01:04:46,596
よくあることじゃないか
Isn't it a common thing?

762
01:04:46,696 --> 01:04:48,096
everyone

763
01:04:48,196 --> 01:04:50,396
こんなに努力したって
Even if I put in this much effort

764
01:04:50,496 --> 01:04:52,396
すぐには出ない結果に
Results that don't come out immediately

765
01:04:52,496 --> 01:04:54,396
ムカついてるの何故だろう
I wonder why I'm getting annoyed

766
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:02,959

01:05:04,157 --> 01:05:07,239

Bye Bye Bye, towards the future

772
01:05:23,145 --> 01:05:26,645
Bye Bye Bye Bye Bye

773
01:05:34,904 --> 01:05:38,005
なんとか気分を高めてみたわ
I've tried to raise my mood somehow

774
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,988
いい雰囲気ね　けれども
It's a nice atmosphere, however

775
01:05:42,604 --> 01:05:45,845

People around me always say things

776
