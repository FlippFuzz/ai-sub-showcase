00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,430
Every day like it's on repeat

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,700
I need a rhythmic breakdown

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,600
Oh honey, the nightlife is calling

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,400
Don't need a steady simple melody

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,140
Can you make it original?

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,400
Take me away, like it's just the two of us tonight

8
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,000
Do you feel the music?

9
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,230
Baby, meet me underneath the strobe light

10
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,780
Come alive

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,540
Moving my feet to something new

12
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,100
I know we only got tonight

13
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,460
Give me that beat, get me dancing

14
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,330
Lately I'm dancing alone

15
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,800
So robotic, so emotionless

16
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,000
But then I see you across the dance floor

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,750
So now honey, follow me

18
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,730
I need a rhythmic red hot melody

19
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,330
Something to keep me up all night

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,500
Don't look away, now it's just the two of us tonight

21
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,400
Do you feel the music?

22
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,000
Baby, meet me underneath the strobe light

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,580
Come alive

24
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,350
Moving my feet to something new

25
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,950
I know we only got tonight

26
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,880
Give me that beat, get me dancing

27
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,130
Feel it rush through me

28
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,650
胸の鼓動 熱くさせて
Make my heart beat hot

29
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,820
Keep on my heart beat パパパパパ
Keep on my heart beat pa-pa-pa-pa-pa

30
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,300

熱くさせるわ
I'll make it hot

33
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,420
Music gets me so high tonight

34
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,330
You've got me shining bright like a prism

35
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,000
But it's okay, I don't care who's watching

36
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,650
So baby, meet me underneath the strobe light

37
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,150
Come alive

38
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,000
Moving my feet to something new

39
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,340
Baby, meet me underneath the strobe light

40
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,920
Come alive

41
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,810
Moving my feet to something new

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,520
I know we only got tonight

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,340
Give me that beat, get me dancing

44
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,880
I know we only got tonight

45
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,810
Give me that beat, get me dancing

46
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,130
Feel it rush through me

47
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,150
I know we only got tonight

48
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,200
Give me that beat, get me dancing

49
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,580
Feel it rush through me

50
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,280
Baby, can we dance until the daylight?

51
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,200
Crazy

52
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,460
About this rhythm, making you

53
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,750
Hi, Kikkiriki!

54
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,400
Quick note that there is probably going to be

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,950
a director's cut release later on,

56
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,160
so please look forward to that.

57
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,840
That will probably have some fixes

58
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,510
for some scuff moments.

59
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,930
Now enjoy!

60
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,370
Ladylike / KIRA

61
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,450
Under the moonlight, we kiss goodbye

62
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,820
You walk off wearing your disguise

63
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,900
Never give me something and don't think twice

64
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,340
And I told you all the things I would do

65
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,900
But does it matter when you chase after

66
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,540
the pleasure you can't have?

67
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,140
Now look where you ended up

68
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,400

Boy, I'll make you crazy

75
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,140

And I've had enough

ね、あの、うちは、ま、hololive Englishでは、あの、トップアイドルかなと思うんだけど…
After all, if I'm the top idol in hololive English,

166
00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:01,045
もちろん！
Of course!

167
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:04,045
…hololive Japanだとね、ねねちかなと思ったんだよね！
then for hololive Japan, it would be Nenechi!

168
00:12:04,145 --> 00:12:06,545
あはは、ありがとう！
Gosh, thank you!

169
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:11,845
Nenechi is hololive Japan's number one idol in my heart! So I thought

170
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:16,545
that the following game would be very fitting. Um, so I thought up this game.

171
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:21,045
The rules are the following: first of all, the name is Idol Shiritori.

172
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:25,545
The normal Shiritori works the following: I say a Japanese word,

173
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:29,545
and they usually are built up in syllables. So the syllable that it ends with,

174
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:34,545
Nenechi will have to think of a new word that starts with that syllable.

175
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:39,545
And then we keep on connecting and connecting until someone makes a mistake

176
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:43,545
or says a word that already has been said. But here is the twist:

177
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:49,045
we can only use idol words, or cute or girly words, feminine words.

178
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:54,045
So anything that's cutesy and idol-y. Yeah, I think us two,

179
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:59,045
we shouldn't have any issues with that.

180
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,045
うちらだったら問題ないよね、アイドルしりとり！
Idol Shiritori should be a piece of cake for us, right?

181
00:13:02,145 --> 00:13:04,045
できる、できるよ！I can!
We can do it!

182
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:06,045
イェーイ！
Yay!

183
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:10,545
オッケー、じゃ、じゃ、やってみるか。ねねち、準備オッケーか？
Okay, then let's give it a shot! Nenechi, you ready?

184
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:12,545
オッケー！
Ready!

185
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:15,545
いいよ、なるべく、あの、早めのペースでやりましょう！
Let's try to keep the pace up.

186
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:16,845
オッケー！よし！
Okay! All right!

187
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:20,545
じゃ、始めよう！スタート！
Here we go! Start!

188
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:21,045
スタート！
Start!

189
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:23,045

194
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:41,045

You said a word that ends in "n"!

195
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:42,545
あ、そうだ！
Oh, right!

196
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:44,045
ブッブー！
Bzzt!

197
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:46,545
アウト！ねねち、アウト！
Nenechi, you lose!

198
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:48,545
あー、しまった！
Darn it!

199
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:51,045
ちょっと待って！もう一回やりたい！もう一回やりたい！
Hang on... Gimme another chance! Come on!

200
00:13:51,145 --> 00:13:56,045
Round 1, I win! One point for Takanashi Kiwawa! OK, OK, OK.

201
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:59,045
じゃ、あの、3ラウンドやりましょう！
Then let's do three rounds.

202
00:13:59,145 --> 00:14:00,045
オッケー！
Okay!

203
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:03,045
OK! じゃ、次はねねちから始めよう！
Okay, you start, Nenechi.

204
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:05,545

そうだね。
Probably for the best!

285
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:45,057
Because I lost, so we decided that we both win in the end, yes.

286
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:50,057
I may have won twice and she may have won once, but in the end...

...we're O'riends, so all is good, we love each other, world is beautiful, world is peace. Yay!

00:18:25,057 --> 00:18:30,057
SPARKS / Takanashi Kiara

302
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:44,257
Lying down on the floor late night

303
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:47,857
And you don't know, don't know, don't know what to do

304
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:52,557
Hard to tell what's wrong, what's right

305
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:55,257
If you still don't know, don't know, don't know what to do

306
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:58,557
The storm hits hard and you're losing your way

307
00:18:59,057 --> 00:19:02,257
Just take a chance and dance in the rain

308
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:05,557
'Cause you've got the key, never throw it away

309
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:08,557
Don't forget, don't forget what I said

310
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:11,057
Get out of your head

311
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:13,557
Life is only what you make it

312
00:19:13,557 --> 00:19:16,557
You're gonna be okay

313
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:20,557
So go ahead and do it, do it, if you want it, let's get to it

314
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:23,557
Everybody's gonna know your name

315
00:19:23,857 --> 00:19:28,857
'Cause sparks like the flame, turn the dark of the night into day

316
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:30,557
Don't stop, don't stop

317
00:19:30,557 --> 00:19:32,257
Just go your own way

318
00:19:32,557 --> 00:19:35,557

But sometimes I do, don't you think of the things they told you

362
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:32,369
There must be more than this, there must be more than what you know too

363
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:36,569
I wasn't made to feel, but lately I can't help it

486
00:30:19,893 --> 00:30:22,193
意気地ないな
I'm such a coward

487
00:30:22,593 --> 00:30:26,593
勇気のテスト乗り越えなきゃ
I have to pass the test of courage

488
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:28,593
逃げるなって
don't run away...

489
00:30:29,893 --> 00:30:32,393
「おはよう」のオーディションして
Having an audition for "Good Morning"

490
00:30:32,393 --> 00:30:34,693
弱虫な自分に勝って
Beating my cowardly self

491
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,993
金曜日は頑張らなくちゃ
I have to try my best on Friday

492
00:30:39,993 --> 00:30:43,193
だって2日会えないからね
Because I won't see you for two days

493
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:46,293
眠そうな君を見てる
I'm looking at you, looking sleepy

494
00:30:46,293 --> 00:30:48,993
それだけで満足しちゃって
Just that makes me satisfied

495
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:52,593
ダメだって頑張らなくちゃ
But I have to try my best

496
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:55,793
そっと声に出してみた
I tried to say it softly

497
00:31:08,793 --> 00:31:10,693
8時0分　2車両目
8:00, the second car

498
00:31:10,693 --> 00:31:13,193
座られてた　いつもの席
Someone was sitting in my usual seat

499
00:31:14,693 --> 00:31:17,393
ついてないな　空模様まで
Unlucky... even the weather

500
00:31:17,393 --> 00:31:20,393
泣きそうです
is about to cry

501
00:31:21,093 --> 00:31:23,593
8時7分　準備まだ
8:07, not ready yet

502
00:31:23,593 --> 00:31:26,293
ちょっと待って
Wait a minute

503
00:31:26,693 --> 00:31:29,393
ドキドキが震え混じり
My heartbeat mixed with trembling

504
00:31:29,393 --> 00:31:32,493
その言葉は　掻き消された
Those words were drowned out

505
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,993
雨宿り立ち尽くす僕に
To me standing still in the rain

506
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:40,093
「傘をどうぞ」
"Here, have an umbrella"

507
00:31:40,593 --> 00:31:43,393
君は少し恥ずかしそうに
You, looking a bit embarrassed

508
00:31:43,393 --> 00:31:46,193
下を向いた
looked down

509
00:31:46,893 --> 00:31:49,093
「ありがとう」震えていた
"Thank you," I was trembling

510
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:52,293
練習してない言葉
Words I hadn't practiced

511
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:56,093
言えたから頑張らなくちゃ
I said it, so I have to try my best

512
00:31:56,093 --> 00:31:59,293
だって2日会えないからね
Because I won't see you for two days

513
00:31:59,993 --> 00:32:02,393
大好きな君を見てる
I'm looking at you, whom I love

514
00:32:02,393 --> 00:32:05,193
それだけで満足しなくて
Just that isn't enough anymore

515
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:09,293
月曜日は頑張らなくちゃ
I have to try my best on Monday

516
00:32:09,293 --> 00:32:12,593
そっと声に出してみた
I tried to say it softly

517
00:32:25,593 --> 00:32:29,393
夢では自然に話せるのに
In my dreams I can talk naturally, but...

518
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:34,493
勇気のテスト乗り越えるから
I'll pass the test of courage

519
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:37,493
少し待ってて
so wait a little bit

520
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:40,893
「おはよう」のオーディションして
Having an audition for "Good Morning"

521
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:44,293
髪型もバッチリOK
My hairstyle is perfect too

522
00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:47,893
8時7分に君を待ってる
I'm waiting for you at 8:07

523
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:51,093
だって今日は言えるからね
Because I can say it today

524
00:32:51,293 --> 00:32:55,293
「おやすみ」も言いたいけれど
I want to say "Good Night" too, but...

525
00:32:55,293 --> 00:32:57,293
ちょっと待って
wait a minute

526
00:32:57,493 --> 00:33:00,393
大好きな言葉なんだ
It's my favorite word

527
00:33:00,393 --> 00:33:03,593
だって君に会えるからね
Because I get to see you

528
00:33:22,693 --> 00:33:24,493
Alright everybody! How was that?

529
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:26,493
Did you like the previous songs?

530
00:33:26,493 --> 00:33:29,593
It was "The Biggest Dreamer" from Matsuura Aya...

531
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:32,493
...and "Kinyoubi no Ohayou" from HoneyWorks! Yeah!

532
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:34,893
Um, especially "The Biggest Dreamer"...

533
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:37,893
I was really excited to perform for you guys...

534
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:41,493
...because it's a Hello! Project song that probably a lot of you guys don't know.

535
00:33:41,493 --> 00:33:44,493
But did you like it? Did you like it? Did you like it? It's pretty cool!

536
00:33:44,493 --> 00:33:46,193
Yeah, Matsuura Aya is god.

537
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:47,493
So, next up...

538
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:51,493
...we will have MORE GUESTS! MORE GUESTS! MORE GUESTS!

539
00:33:51,493 --> 00:33:54,893
Guess who's next? Who could possibly be my next guests?

540
00:33:54,893 --> 00:33:56,893
What do you think, guys? Hmm? Who?

541
00:33:56,893 --> 00:34:00,293
Well, so, it will be none other than...

542
00:34:00,293 --> 00:34:03,893
...my beloved Tori-ken hololive members!

543
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:07,193

00:34:19,193 --> 00:34:21,893
Yeah! Well, I'm already doing gestures...

552
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,893
...but I wonder what are we doing with you guys? What could it be?

553
00:34:25,893 --> 00:34:29,093
Charades! We're playing Charades!

554
00:34:29,093 --> 00:34:31,993
Yay! The typical...

555
00:34:31,993 --> 00:34:36,093
...the typical game that you have to play when you're in 3D.

556
00:34:36,093 --> 00:34:39,893
Well, I think we have like a synergy...

557
00:34:39,893 --> 00:34:43,093
...Horo-Tori synergy!

558
00:34:43,093 --> 00:34:46,093
So whatever move...

559
00:35:00,755 --> 00:35:02,905
What I do, you will understand, right?

560
00:35:03,305 --> 00:35:04,305
Yeah!

561
00:35:04,405 --> 00:35:05,205
Of course!

562
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:06,105
Yes!

563
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:14,605
Okay, actually the words are provided by none other than Gawr Gura, who is somewhere behind the scenes.

564
00:35:15,105 --> 00:35:22,105
So she will feed me the words, I will act them out and you guys will guess them.

565
00:35:22,305 --> 00:35:24,605
So shall we begin?

566
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:27,105
Yeah!

567
00:35:27,855 --> 00:35:29,305
Word number one!

00:35:30,105 --> 00:35:32,605
Alright! Let's go! Go go go!

FEVER NIGHT
Takanashi Kiara

648
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:58,392
I'm tired of the same song

649
00:40:58,492 --> 00:41:01,442
Every day

650
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:03,492
Like it's on repeat

651
00:41:03,642 --> 00:41:07,242
I need a risky break down

652
00:41:07,392 --> 00:41:10,892
Oh, honey the night is calling

653
00:41:11,342 --> 00:41:14,392
Go mid-steady simple melody

654
00:41:14,592 --> 00:41:18,342
Can you make it original?

655
00:41:19,092 --> 00:41:21,142
Take me away

656
00:41:21,142 --> 00:41:23,192
Like it's just the two of us

657
00:41:23,242 --> 00:41:25,842
I'm ready

658
00:41:25,992 --> 00:41:28,142
Do you feel the music baby?

659
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:31,142
Meet me underneath strobe light

660
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:33,792
Come alive

661
00:41:34,342 --> 00:41:37,142
Move my feet to something new

662
00:41:37,242 --> 00:41:40,142

All right. Well, girls,
we are the same generation,

787
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:31,641
so one would assume that
you know a thing or two about me, right?

788

And if you answer at least four of the questions correctly,

00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:13,141
then I shall take you out to dinner sometime.

797

798

Boneheads and Feathers.

809
00:51:47,641 --> 00:51:50,141
Nah, we got this on lock. It's just math.

810
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:51,641
Just don't ask us about math.

811
00:51:52,141 --> 00:51:54,641
No, no, no, I don't even know math either, so.

812
00:51:54,941 --> 00:51:57,141
First question, are you ready?

813

00:52:08,641 --> 00:52:11,141
Exactly! Kiara's... No, no, no, Kiara's...

819
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:14,141
Did you say Kiara or Kentucky?

820
00:52:14,641 --> 00:52:17,141
No, I've never heard of that place.

821
00:52:17,141 --> 00:52:20,141
I said Kiara. You guys misheard. Sorry, that's your ears' problem.

822
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:22,141
Kiara Fried Phoenix.

823
00:52:22,141 --> 00:52:25,641
I said Kiara Fried Phoenix. I know KFP, I've eaten KFP before.

824
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:29,141
I should almost give you a minus point for that answer.

825
00:52:29,141 --> 00:52:32,141
No, no, no, please don't take away my degree in Kiarology.

826
00:52:32,141 --> 00:52:33,641
Please, I beg you.

827

Okay, all right. I'll give you that point.

828
00:52:36,641 --> 00:52:40,141
That was easy though. It will get more difficult maybe, maybe.

829
00:52:40,141 --> 00:52:41,641
Uh oh.

830
00:52:41,641 --> 00:52:44,141
All right, next question, and I wrote it down...

831
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:49,141

832
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:50,641

00:52:56,641 --> 00:53:00,141
What was... Okay, a new rule.

835
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:04,641
I will only allow correct answers if you had one...

836
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:09,141
if you lock in one wrong answer, that's a no-point.

837
00:53:09,641 --> 00:53:11,141
All right, Gura, don't fuck this up.

838
00:53:11,141 --> 00:53:13,141
Yeah, right, like... okay.

839
00:53:14,641 --> 00:53:20,141
Okay, so, question number two.
What was Takanashi Kiara's second original single?

840
00:53:21,141 --> 00:54:31,141
What's the name of Kiara's 2nd single?

841
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:23,141
Heart Challenger!

842
00:53:23,141 --> 00:53:24,141
Yes!

843
00:53:24,141 --> 00:53:25,141
Yeah!

844
00:53:25,141 --> 00:53:27,641
I was gonna say that too! Let's go!

845
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:31,641
Sorry, Goombus, I'm a little bit faster than you sometimes.

846
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:34,641
Gura needs some time to shine. Gura needs to shine.

847
00:53:35,141 --> 00:53:37,141
Okay, Gura, the next one's you.

848
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:39,141
I'll be faster. No, they're gonna get harder.

849
00:53:39,141 --> 00:53:42,641
I'm leaving the hard ones for Gura actually, it's all part of my plan.

850
00:53:42,641 --> 00:53:45,141
Smart, smart, smart. Okay, let's see.

851
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:48,641
By the way, what was Kiara's first... song, by the way? Extra point.

852
00:53:49,141 --> 00:53:51,141
Hinotori.

853
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:55,141
Right, my first... sorry, third? Did you... probably acoustically misheard.

854
00:53:55,641 --> 00:53:57,141
Oh, I thought you said first.

855
00:53:57,141 --> 00:54:02,141
No, no. Sorry, I can't... yeah, my TH always sounds like an F.

856
00:54:02,141 --> 00:54:03,141
It's okay, it's cute.

857
00:54:03,141 --> 00:54:08,141
My... number three of my songs was... but that's not a question. Sparks, yes, okay.

858
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:17,141
Good, good. Sparks, light the flame!

859
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:21,141
Okay, no, that was not the third question.
The third question is coming now.

860
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:29,141
Question number three...

861
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:37,141
What's the name of the mouse/rat that I lived with in Japan?

862
00:54:32,141 --> 00:54:59,141
Name of the mouse/rat Kiara lived with in Japan?

863
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:40,141
I know this. I'm gonna let Gura answer.

864
00:54:41,641 --> 00:54:44,141
I feel like I've been told this before.

865
00:54:44,641 --> 00:54:45,641
Oh shit.

866
00:54:46,141 --> 00:54:48,641
Do you need to phone a friend?

867
00:54:50,141 --> 00:54:51,141
Okay, Casper.

868
00:54:51,141 --> 00:54:53,141
Sorry, Cali!

869
00:54:53,141 --> 00:54:55,641
I can't help myself.

870
00:54:56,141 --> 00:54:59,141
It's the easy ones, man! Actually...

871
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:02,153
And by the way, I just recently uploaded a video...

872
00:55:02,153 --> 00:55:05,653
...a lore video that explains the whole story behind Casper on my channel.

873
00:55:05,653 --> 00:55:08,653
So if you guys are curious, you could go watch that...

874
00:55:08,653 --> 00:55:11,653
...if you want to learn more about Casper, mysterious, yes.

875
00:55:12,553 --> 00:55:14,453
Casper the friendly ghost, yeah, yeah, yeah.

876
00:55:14,553 --> 00:55:16,953
At first I hated him, then I loved him.

877
00:55:17,053 --> 00:55:18,653
Okay, fourth question!

878
00:55:18,753 --> 00:55:21,153
If you get this one right, then you already have...

879
00:55:21,253 --> 00:55:23,853
...a free dinner with me!

880
00:55:24,853 --> 00:55:26,253
Thank you for carrying, Calli.

881
00:55:26,353 --> 00:55:27,353
No problem.

882
00:55:27,453 --> 00:55:29,753
No, you got this girl, you definitely got the next one.

883
00:55:29,853 --> 00:55:32,453
Dude, I don't know if I do got this.

884
00:55:33,853 --> 00:55:37,553
Okay, question number four! Da-da-da-da-da, dum!

885
00:55:38,353 --> 00:55:40,553
How many re-debuts...

886
00:55:40,653 --> 00:55:42,653
...did Takanashi Kiara have?

887
00:55:42,453 --> 00:55:45,153
How many re-debuts has Kiara had?

888
00:55:43,153 --> 00:55:46,153
Now think before you yell it out loud. Re-debuts.

889
00:55:51,453 --> 00:55:53,153
Wait, what counts as a re-debut?

890
00:55:53,253 --> 00:55:55,453
Well, not debut, but debuts after the re-debut.

891
00:55:57,253 --> 00:56:00,353
I do have a history with re-debuts. It hasn't been one in a while, but...

892
00:56:00,453 --> 00:56:05,553
...there was a time where I had many reasons for many re-debuts.

893
00:56:07,253 --> 00:56:08,853
Maybe you know this.

894
00:56:09,253 --> 00:56:12,253
My brain wants to say two, but I don't know.

895
00:56:12,353 --> 00:56:13,453
Okay girl, let's brainstorm.

896
00:56:13,553 --> 00:56:15,453
All right, let's brainstorm. Do it, faster!

897
00:56:16,153 --> 00:56:17,453
Yeah, ten more seconds!

898
00:56:17,553 --> 00:56:21,353
Oh shit, you remember the first one when the channel got nuked?

899
00:56:21,453 --> 00:56:24,353
The next one was the German one, right? Wait, wait, wait, wait.

900
00:56:24,453 --> 00:56:26,453
Okay, so I think it's two.

901
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:27,453
You both think it's two?

902
00:56:27,553 --> 00:56:28,553
Are you sure?

903
00:56:29,653 --> 00:56:31,153
I think it's two.

904
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:33,153
Correct answer! Yay!

905
00:56:33,253 --> 00:56:36,253
Go Gura! That was close!

906
00:56:36,353 --> 00:56:38,453
Okay, okay, okay, well...

907
00:56:38,553 --> 00:56:40,153
...I still have one more question though.

908
00:56:40,653 --> 00:56:43,853
You're a winner, chicken dinner from the chicken, let's go!

909
00:56:43,953 --> 00:56:46,153
I think we're four for four so far.

910
00:56:46,253 --> 00:56:50,153
Yeah we are, but I guess my questions were a little bit too easy.

911
00:56:50,253 --> 00:56:55,453
So for the next question, you will have to answer correctly otherwise...

912
00:56:55,553 --> 00:56:57,353
Otherwise? Oh damn it.

913
00:56:57,453 --> 00:57:00,153
Otherwise there will be... yeah, it will be all or nothing.

914
00:57:00,253 --> 00:57:02,153
Is it all or nothing? Changing the rules on us.

915
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:04,253
Can we double down? Do we get dessert too?

916
00:57:04,353 --> 00:57:06,453
Of course, of course! All right, let's do it.

917
00:57:07,253 --> 00:57:09,253
Excellent, excellent, last question!

918
00:57:09,353 --> 00:57:12,453
And how should we do this? Hmm...

919
00:57:13,253 --> 00:57:15,453
I want your separate answers.

920
00:57:16,253 --> 00:57:18,653
Huh? What happened? Wait, was changing the rules...

921
00:57:19,253 --> 00:57:24,153
I want... no, I just want to see if you both get it right without hearing the other's answer first.

922
00:57:24,253 --> 00:57:27,453
Okay, I'll take off my headphones. I'm out.

923
00:57:27,553 --> 00:57:29,253
Okay, okay, okay, ma'am.

924
00:57:29,353 --> 00:57:31,553
But wait, no, how do I give you a sign that you should come back?

925
00:57:31,653 --> 00:57:34,153
Whatever, just bring it back in in 30 seconds, okay?

926
00:57:34,253 --> 00:57:37,453
Okay, do like... throw up some kind of weird hand symbol.

927
00:57:37,553 --> 00:57:40,553
Ah okay, I'll do this. Do a little heart, yeah.

928
00:57:40,653 --> 00:57:43,453
And then I'll come back. All right, bye. I'm taking off my headphones.

929
00:57:44,153 --> 00:57:46,153
Bye! Gawr Gura!

930
00:57:46,253 --> 00:57:49,253
I actually have a feeling you'll get this one right.

931
00:57:49,353 --> 00:57:51,253
Really? Okay.

932
00:57:51,353 --> 00:57:56,453
Spell out for me without thinking too much. You have to say it quickly.

933
00:57:57,253 --> 00:57:58,653
Auf wiedersehen.

934
00:57:59,153 --> 00:58:02,153
Spell auf wiedersehen

935
00:57:59,153 --> 00:58:02,653
Go! Auf... A-U-F. Auf...

936
00:58:03,153 --> 00:58:07,353
A-U-F, wiedersehen. V-I-E-D-E-R...

937
00:58:07,453 --> 00:58:12,453
...wiedersehen, S-E-N, S-E-U-N, S-E-N, auf...

938
00:58:14,453 --> 00:58:17,453
...da... A-U-F. Auf is the first part.

939
00:58:18,253 --> 00:58:22,553
Wiedersehen. V-I-E-D-E-R...

940
00:58:23,653 --> 00:58:26,653
...S-E-N, S-E-Y. Ah! It's hard to follow!

941
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,453
It's hard to follow! Final answer, go!

942
00:58:30,253 --> 00:58:31,653
A-U-F.

943
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:35,553
V.

944
00:58:36,453 --> 00:58:41,453
I-E-D-E-R S-E-E-N.

945
00:58:42,253 --> 00:58:44,453
Wrong! Boo-boom!

946
00:58:44,553 --> 00:58:46,453
No! Okay Calli come back, Calli come back.

947
00:58:47,253 --> 00:58:49,553
All I heard was wrong. Is it that hard of a question? Throw it at me, Kiara.

948
00:58:54,253 --> 00:58:58,653
Now Calli recently had a lot of fun learning German with me, so you might...

949
00:58:58,753 --> 00:59:01,153
...you might get this too.

950
00:59:01,253 --> 00:59:03,453
Fuck! The German question.

951
00:59:04,253 --> 00:59:06,153
Yes! All right, good luck buddy.

952
00:59:06,253 --> 00:59:09,453
Spell, and you have to do it quickly, okay? No thinking.

953
00:59:10,253 --> 00:59:14,453
Spell my end greeting, auf wiedersehen.

954
00:59:15,253 --> 00:59:18,453
No! Stop! Don't! A-V...

955
00:59:19,253 --> 00:59:23,453
...I-V... wait no! No! Shit! Damn it girl, come on!

956
00:59:24,253 --> 00:59:27,453
Auf wiedersehen... uh, fuck! That's too hard of a question!

957
00:59:28,253 --> 00:59:32,453
I thought this was a Kiara quiz, not a spelling bee!

958
00:59:33,253 --> 00:59:37,453
Chicken! A-V, arrivederci, arrivederci, grazie!

959
00:59:38,253 --> 00:59:42,453
Mama mia! Final answer! V... no! Um...

960
00:59:43,253 --> 00:59:46,453
R... no wait, it's not arrivederci, it's auf wiedersehen.

961
00:59:47,253 --> 00:59:49,453
A-V... I'll give you ten more seconds!

962
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:52,453
Come on, bonehead! A-V...

963
00:59:53,253 --> 00:59:56,453
...R-E-R... wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!

964
00:59:56,553 --> 00:59:57,453
No!

965
00:59:57,553 --> 00:59:59,153
Wrong! What the fuck!

966
01:00:00,165 --> 01:00:01,198
Beep that out.

967
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:02,531
Beep that out whoever's editing this.

968
01:00:02,531 --> 01:00:04,698
It's okay, on my channel it's allowed. Yeah.

969
01:00:04,698 --> 01:00:05,265
Okay.

970
01:00:05,265 --> 01:00:10,231
Well, you know what? I said double down,
but I'm still gonna treat you for dinner. Yay!

971
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:11,931
Yay! Thank you!

972
01:00:11,931 --> 01:00:15,698
Winner winner chicken dinner from the chicken,
as in the chicken is the dinner's from the chicken...

973
01:00:15,698 --> 01:00:18,165
...not the dinner is...
it doesn't mean that the dinner is um, a chicken.

974
01:00:18,165 --> 01:00:19,631
That's true.

975
01:00:18,165 --> 01:00:20,265
It's... it's from the chicken,
so winner winner... chicken...

976
01:00:20,265 --> 01:00:22,231
Mm-hmm.

977
01:00:22,231 --> 01:00:25,931
...I'll shut the fuck up now.
Thank you Kiara, happy birthday!

978
01:00:25,931 --> 01:00:27,865
Thank you! I'll bring you some KFC later.

979
01:00:27,865 --> 01:00:30,565
Wait, what's the answer?

980
01:00:30,565 --> 01:00:32,565
Yeah, you can't just leave us hanging.

981
01:00:32,565 --> 01:00:34,165
Oh, okay. It's A-U-F...

982
01:00:34,165 --> 01:00:35,198
Spell it!

983
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:43,931
SPACE W-I-E-D-E-R-S-E-H-E-N!

984
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:46,565
Oh, Auf... Auf Wiedersehen!

985
01:00:46,565 --> 01:00:51,831
And perfectly, since I just spelled it out,
I will say to you girls, Auf Wiedersehen! Bye-bye!

986
01:00:51,831 --> 01:00:53,498
Bye-bye! Auf Wiedersehen!

987
01:00:53,498 --> 01:00:57,598
Next time ask me to spell 'Schreckt'.
It's a lot actually more difficult.

988
01:00:57,598 --> 01:00:59,165
Oh yeah.

989
01:00:59,165 --> 01:01:03,165
Bye-bye! Happy Birthday!

990
01:01:05,298 --> 01:01:10,698
Alright, on to the next song! Let's go!

01:02:04,331 --> 01:02:06,065
お気に入りに着替えて
Changing into my favorite outfit

1001
01:02:06,065 --> 01:02:10,631
鼻くすぐる香りに
With a scent that tickles my nose

1002
01:02:10,631 --> 01:02:13,331
ハートときめいちゃう
My heart starts fluttering

1003
01:02:13,331 --> 01:02:16,398
Let's start! つくるよ
Let's start! I'm going to make it

1004
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:22,198
ラブ込めて とびきりのチョコレート
With all my love, an extraordinary chocolate

1005
01:02:23,631 --> 01:02:27,131
燃えそうで ギュッと握ったら
If I grip it tight, feeling like it's burning

1006
01:02:27,131 --> 01:02:30,465
未完成の合図
A sign of being incomplete

1007
01:02:30,465 --> 01:02:34,365
カラフルな恋の味
The taste of a colorful love

1008
01:02:34,365 --> 01:02:37,565
溶けちゃう前に受け取って Please
Please take it before it melts

1009
01:02:37,565 --> 01:02:41,498
鳴り響く鐘の音
The sound of the ringing bells

1010
01:02:41,498 --> 01:02:45,498
校舎の窓辺で 二人
The two of us by the school window

1011
01:02:45,498 --> 01:02:49,298
ねえ 早く言わなくちゃ
Hey, I have to tell you quickly

1012
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:52,065
照れちゃうけど「好きです」
It's embarrassing, but "I like you"

1013
01:02:52,065 --> 01:02:58,431
この思い 君まで届け
Let these feelings reach you

1014
01:02:58,431 --> 01:03:00,165
With me!

1015
01:03:10,298 --> 01:03:14,798
チクタク 進んでく
Tick-tock, time keeps ticking away

1016
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:17,465
気持ちは 止められないの
I can't stop my feelings

1017
01:03:17,465 --> 01:03:21,165
ちょこっと 勇気出して
I'll muster up a little courage

1018
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:24,898
贈るよ ラブレター
And give you my love letter

1019
01:03:24,898 --> 01:03:27,931
大好き なのに
Even though I love you so much

1020
01:03:27,931 --> 01:03:31,498
何十回 書いても
No matter how many times I write it

1021
01:03:31,498 --> 01:03:33,165
伝えきれない Make me, make me
I can't fully express it, make me, make me

1022
01:03:33,165 --> 01:03:38,365
意気地なしなんて 空の彼方飛んでいけ
My cowardice, fly away beyond the sky

1023
01:03:38,365 --> 01:03:42,665
何度もチェックして
I check it over and over again

1024
01:03:42,665 --> 01:03:45,465
君に会う時は
When I meet you

1025
01:03:45,465 --> 01:03:49,165
100倍増しで
I want to be a hundred times

1026
01:03:49,165 --> 01:03:54,165
可愛くなりたいの 鏡の前 にらめっこ
more cute, staring at myself in the mirror

1027
01:03:54,165 --> 01:03:55,498
Let's go!

1028
01:03:55,498 --> 01:04:00,265
いつもと違うスウィートさで
With a sweetness different from usual

1029
01:04:00,265 --> 01:04:03,365
ハートを虜にしたい
I want to captivate your heart

1030
01:04:03,365 --> 01:04:07,298
ぐるぐる 変えてみても
Even if I try changing it again and again

1031
01:04:07,298 --> 01:04:10,298
髪型が 決まらない
I can't decide on a hairstyle

1032
01:04:10,298 --> 01:04:14,231
告白のシミュレーション
Simulation of a confession

1033
01:04:14,231 --> 01:04:17,498
ドキドキ 騒ぎ出しちゃう
My heart starts making a commotion

1034
01:04:17,498 --> 01:04:21,165
月より願い込めて
I'll put my wish on the moon

1035
01:04:21,165 --> 01:04:24,565
一発勝負 明日は
A one-shot chance, tomorrow

1036
01:04:24,565 --> 01:04:30,165
絶対に晴れますように
I hope it will definitely be sunny

1037
01:04:46,231 --> 01:04:50,265
And I'm here to tell you that I love you through and through

1038
01:04:52,031 --> 01:04:57,598
There's no one else in this world that I would trade for you

1039
01:05:02,061 --> 01:05:05,173
萌え袖　ぶきゅっと握りしめたら
Holding my moe-sleeves tight

1040
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:08,577
ミッション開始の合図
The signal to start the mission

1041

Two people by the school building window

1045
01:05:23,577 --> 01:05:27,277
ねえ早く言わなくちゃ
Hey, I have to say it soon

1046
01:05:27,277 --> 01:05:30,377
照れちゃうけど好きですプリーズ
It's embarrassing, but I like you, please

1047
01:05:30,517 --> 01:05:36,747
この想い君まで届け
May these feelings reach you

1048
01:05:36,877 --> 01:05:38,177
With me! Hop-step!

1049
01:05:39,677 --> 01:05:41,177
Uu~ Hey!

1050
01:05:43,177 --> 01:05:44,677
Say! Wow!

1051
01:05:46,677 --> 01:05:48,177
Yay!

1052
01:06:03,577 --> 01:06:06,277
Yay! That was Heart Challenger!

1053
01:06:06,477 --> 01:06:09,677
Whoo! Remember a while ago

1054
01:06:09,677 --> 01:06:12,677
at Dokomi where I had backup dancers

1055
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,977
who were doing the dancing for me?

1056
01:06:15,077 --> 01:06:18,977
And now I learned it myself and performed it myself!

1057
01:06:19,077 --> 01:06:21,977
Yay! That was fun, hope you enjoyed that.

1058
01:06:22,077 --> 01:06:25,977
Well, you know, if you look at the time,

1059
01:06:25,977 --> 01:06:28,177
you might think, oh, it's gonna be over soon.

1060
01:06:28,277 --> 01:06:31,177
And yeah, there is one more song,

1061
01:06:31,177 --> 01:06:34,177
but before that, let me say a few words to you guys.

1062
01:06:35,077 --> 01:06:38,177
Eisho. Yeah, we are getting close to the end,

1063
01:06:38,177 --> 01:06:41,377
and I wanted to do something like this

1064
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:43,677
for a long time, as you probably know.

1065
01:06:43,777 --> 01:06:47,177
And I wanted to show off my dance moves for so long,

1066
01:06:47,177 --> 01:06:50,177
which is, it's one of my, I guess, prominent skills...

1067
01:06:50,177 --> 01:06:53,177
...and it has been my dream since the start

1068
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:55,677
to show it off, to get into this 3D body,

1069
01:06:55,677 --> 01:06:58,677
finally be free to do whatever I want.

1070
01:06:58,777 --> 01:07:01,477
Yeah, and the day has finally come.

1071
01:07:01,477 --> 01:07:03,677
I hope you guys enjoyed it so far.

1072
01:07:03,777 --> 01:07:08,677
Yeah. I want to definitely say a big thanks

1073
01:07:08,677 --> 01:07:11,677
to Ame and Ina and Gura for helping so much

1074
01:07:11,677 --> 01:07:14,177
with the recording and the setup.

1075
01:07:14,277 --> 01:07:18,677
You know, Ame basically built a whole studio

1076
01:07:18,677 --> 01:07:21,677
for me to record this in,

1077
01:07:21,677 --> 01:07:24,177
and I really, really, really appreciate that.

1078
01:07:24,177 --> 01:07:27,177
Without her, it wouldn't have been possible at all.

1079
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:30,677
And also big thanks to Kanauru for putting

1080
01:07:30,677 --> 01:07:33,677
together all of this into a proper concert

1081
01:07:33,677 --> 01:07:36,677
and even creating this beautiful stage here.

1082
01:07:36,777 --> 01:07:39,177
Wow! Look, isn't it nice?

1083
01:07:39,277 --> 01:07:41,477
Yeah, thank you so much.

1084
01:07:41,577 --> 01:07:44,677
In the future, I really hope that

1085
01:07:44,677 --> 01:07:47,677
I can do more like this more often

1086
01:07:47,677 --> 01:07:51,177
and get more members to join me in 3D

1087
01:07:51,177 --> 01:07:53,677
if possible, to dance together.

1088
01:07:53,777 --> 01:07:57,177
Yeah, especially you know, Myth and Holotori

1089
01:07:57,177 --> 01:08:00,177
and EN's... with all of them I want to dance

1090
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:02,977
and yeah, have fun together.

1091
01:08:03,077 --> 01:08:06,177
And I think we're getting there slowly but surely.

1092
01:08:06,277 --> 01:08:09,677
By the way, if you missed it,

1093
01:08:09,677 --> 01:08:12,677
the birthday merchandise was announced

1094
01:08:12,677 --> 01:08:15,977
in the previous stream before this one,

1095
01:08:15,977 --> 01:08:18,677
the countdown stream.

1096
01:08:18,777 --> 01:08:21,677
And it's linked in the description,

1097
01:08:21,677 --> 01:08:25,577
so please go check it out if you're interested.

1098
01:08:25,677 --> 01:08:28,677
And yeah, last but not least,

1099
01:08:28,677 --> 01:08:31,177
I want to thank KFP!

1100
01:08:31,277 --> 01:08:35,177
You know how much I appreciate your support

1101
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:38,377
and you believing in me and trusting in me

1102
01:08:38,377 --> 01:08:41,877
means the world to me.

1103
01:08:41,977 --> 01:08:44,677
So thank you for giving me the strength

1104
01:08:44,677 --> 01:08:48,177
in a very, very, very stressful period

1105
01:08:48,177 --> 01:08:51,477
leading up to this day.

1106
01:08:51,577 --> 01:08:54,177
Yeah, I think it was worth it.

1107
01:08:54,277 --> 01:08:57,177
So thank you for waiting for me

1108
01:08:57,177 --> 01:09:00,177
and I will continue working hard

1109
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:03,177
to give back to you as much as I can.

1110
01:09:03,277 --> 01:09:06,677
Please continue supporting me and watch me grow

1111
01:09:06,677 --> 01:09:10,177
into a bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger Phoenix!

1112
01:09:10,277 --> 01:09:13,677
Yeah. Now, there is one more person I want to thank,

1113
01:09:13,677 --> 01:09:16,677
but I will do that with a song.

1114
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:19,677
So please listen to the last song.

1115
01:09:19,677 --> 01:09:21,677
Douzo.

Black★Rock Shooter, where did you go?

1118
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:31,177
聞こえますか？
Can you hear me?

1119
01:09:36,177 --> 01:09:37,677
OK! Papa!

1120
01:09:38,677 --> 01:09:40,677
見てるかー！？
Are you watching!?

1121
01:09:43,377 --> 01:09:48,577
あとどれだけ叫べばいいんだろう
How much more should I shout?

1122
01:09:48,577 --> 01:09:54,977
あとどれだけ泣けばいいんだろう
How much more should I cry?

1123
01:09:54,977 --> 01:10:00,177
もうやめて　わたしはもう走れない
Please stop, I can't run anymore

崩れかけたこの道で
On this road that's starting to crumble,

1128
