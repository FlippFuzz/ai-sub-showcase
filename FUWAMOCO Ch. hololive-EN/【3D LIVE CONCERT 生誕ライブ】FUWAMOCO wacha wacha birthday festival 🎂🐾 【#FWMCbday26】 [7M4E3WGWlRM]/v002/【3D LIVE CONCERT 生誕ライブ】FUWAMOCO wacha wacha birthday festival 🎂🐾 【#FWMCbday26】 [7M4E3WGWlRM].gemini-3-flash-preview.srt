Yeah!

244
00:11:06,229 --> 00:11:08,929

With respect! With respect! With respect! With respect! With respect!

249
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:23,629
But, you know, it'd be cute if we matched, right? Right?

250
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:25,229
Yeah! Oh! Right!

251
00:11:25,229 --> 00:11:30,929
But maybe, we'll just go run and we'll get changed, and you entertain the Ruffians for a second?

252
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,229
Yeah, okay! Entertain them!

253
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:33,229

00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:50,729
I did my best.

00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:56,229
That's right!

266
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:58,229

Yeah! Oh!

270
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:11,729
Um, this next song is one that FUWAMOCO, we wanted to sing with you for such a long time!

271
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:12,729
Yeah, yeah!

272
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:17,729
Something nostalgic and I think you'll be able to see why. There's some rap in there as well.

273
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:21,029
Oh, yeah! Uh-huh! But it's also very cute, right?

274
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:21,629
Yes!

275
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:28,229
次歌う曲は、Calli先輩と一緒にはずっと歌いたかった大好きな曲です。
The next song we'll sing is a song I love that I've wanted to sing with Calli-senpai forever.

276
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:32,229
Yeah! It's both cute, it's cool, yeah! But I think, you know, it shows...

277
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:37,729
...an important part, that you know, you should be proud of what you like, right?

278
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:42,429
Important meaning of being proud, being strong about what you like, yeah!

279
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,429
Yeah, your likes.

280
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:53,229
And whether that be games, anime, idols, figures, or maybe even Vtubers!

281
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:54,229
Oh, nice choice there.

282
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:59,229
Yeah, you know, after all, life is more fun when you're just true to yourself, right?

283
00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:01,229
Definitely. Uh-huh! I agree!

284
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:02,429
So we're going to sing this song for you, okay?

00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:57,717
キミに会えた ずっと離さないでいてね
I met you, please never let me go

344
00:15:58,117 --> 00:16:05,217
ほら キラキラ虹みたい 世界はまわりだす
Look, it's like a sparkling rainbow, the world begins to turn

345
00:16:19,617 --> 00:16:21,217
好き、好き、好きでしょう！大勝負
I'll take a gamble with "Like, like, like!"

346
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:23,017
抱えていたいこの感情
This feeling I want to keep holding

347
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:24,817
歯止め外すよ真剣勝負
I'm letting go of the brakes, it's a real showdown

348
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,717
ためらわないのがいいんでしょ
It's better not to hesitate, right?

349
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,717
そう、恋をもっと実験
Yes, let's experiment more with love

350
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:30,717
でもそれが僕の等身大
But that's my true self

351
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:32,717
キャスト飛ばし世界を革命
Skipping the cast and revolutionizing the world

352
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,217
いわゆる一つの萌え要素
It's what you'd call a "moe" element

353
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:40,717
素直になれたなら Happy days
If I could be honest, these would be happy days

354
00:16:41,117 --> 00:16:44,017
I Like It! I Like It!

355
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:43,817
I Like It! I Like It!

356
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:47,717
好きになれば きっと全てがカラフルで
If you fall in love, everything will surely be colorful

357
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:51,017
Lucky! Lucky!

358
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,817
Lucky! Lucky!

359
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:54,717
星屑さえ 光る宝物さ
Even the stardust is a shining treasure

360
00:16:55,117 --> 00:16:58,017
I Like It! I Like It!

361
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:57,817
I Like It! I Like It!

362
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,717
キミに会えた やっと今日からよろしくね
I met you, finally starting today, please be good to me

363
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:09,217
ほら キラキラ夢みたい 早く抱きしめたい
Look, it's like a sparkling dream, I want to hold you soon

364
00:17:09,617 --> 00:17:12,517
I Like It! I Like It!

365
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:11,817
I Like It! I Like It!

366
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:16,217
手を伸ばせば きっと全てがミラクルで
If you reach out, everything will surely be a miracle

367
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:19,517
Happy! Happy!

368
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:18,817
Happy! Happy!

369
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:23,217
日常でさえ 夢の物語さ
Even everyday life is a dream-like story

370
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:26,517
I Like It! I Like It!

371
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:25,817
I Like It! I Like It!

372
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:30,217
キミに会えた ずっと離さないでいてね
I met you, please never let me go

373
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:39,217
ほら キラキラ虹みたい 世界はまわりだす
Look, it's like a sparkling rainbow, the world begins to turn

374
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:57,317
Calli-senpai! Yeah!

375
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:58,817
Oh bau! Oh bau!

376
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:00,317
Oh bau!

377
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:02,217
I like FuwaMoco!

378
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:04,217
I like Calli-senpai!

379
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,217
Bye bye bau bau! Bye bye!

380
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:15,217
Please listen to our next song.

381
00:18:15,317 --> 00:18:16,317
Jo t'aime, Jo t'aime.

382
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:43,817
Jo t'aime ★ Jo t'aime / Lyrics: Tommy february6 / Music: MALIBU CONVERTIBLE

383
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:53,217
街角に並ぶ 映画のポスター
Movie posters lining the street corner

384
00:18:53,617 --> 00:19:00,217
もうこの街にも 飽きたわ
I've grown tired of this city already

385
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:08,217
終バスの向こうに ため息を返す
Beyond the last bus, I exhale a sigh

386
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:15,717
キャンセルしないで Mon amour pour toi
Don't cancel, my love for you

387
00:19:16,117 --> 00:19:23,717
ハートのぬけがらに 隠した写真
A photo hidden in the hollow shell of my heart

388
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:31,717
誰も知らない 本気の恋 神様は気づいてる
A serious love that nobody knows, God has noticed it

389
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:40,717
Jo t'aime ★ Jo t'aime 叶わない夢なんて 見たくないわ
Jo t'aime ★ Jo t'aime, I don't want to see unfulfillable dreams

390
00:19:41,117 --> 00:19:47,717
でもロマンス 目覚めてゆく
But romance is waking up

391
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:56,717
“愛してるわ” クレープに描く 愛の傘の下で
"I love you," drawn on a crepe, under the umbrella of love

392
00:19:57,117 --> 00:20:03,217
止まぬ雨の音 Jo t'aime ★ Jo t'aime
The sound of unending rain, Jo t'aime ★ Jo t'aime

393
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:09,198
こんな不本意な夜に
I don't want to spend

394
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:12,598
したくはないから
Such a disappointing night,

395
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:17,298
ほんの5分でも
Even for just

396
00:20:17,765 --> 00:20:20,765
会いたい
Five minutes, I want to see you.

397
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:25,265
キャンディショップも
The candy shop

398
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:28,598
レコードショップも
And the record shop,

399
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:36,265
あなたがいないと　つまらない
They're all boring without you.

400
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:44,265
ジャケットのポケットに　入れたままのコインに
With the coin left in my jacket pocket,

401
00:20:45,598 --> 00:20:48,598
賭けるわ　恋の行方
I'll bet on the direction of love,

402
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:51,931
神様が知っている
Only God knows.

403
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:56,265
Je t'aime ★ Je t'aime

404
00:20:56,598 --> 00:21:01,265
退屈な恋なんてしたくないわ
I don't want a boring love.

405
00:21:02,598 --> 00:21:06,265
あっという間に溺れてく
I'm drowning in an instant.

406
00:21:08,265 --> 00:21:10,265
“今がすべて”
“Now is everything,”

407
00:21:10,598 --> 00:21:16,265
カフェ・オ・レが冷めてしまうその前に
Before the café au lait gets cold,

408
00:21:18,598 --> 00:21:20,598
もう一度KISSして
Kiss me once more,

409
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:23,931
Je t'aime ★ Je t'aime

410
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:31,265
物語に鍵をかけて
Locking the story away,

411
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:35,265
ド・ジュアン・ジュ
Deux jeunes gens,

412
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:41,598
あなたの言葉ばかりを夢見ている
I'm only dreaming of your words.

413
00:21:42,265 --> 00:21:45,265
Mon Amour　Je t'aime ★ Je t'aime
Mon Amour, Je t'aime ★ Je t'aime,

414
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:50,265
叶わない夢なんて見たくないわ
I don't want to see unfulfilled dreams.

415
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:56,265
でもロマンス目覚めてゆく
But romance is waking up.

416
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:59,265
“愛してるわ”
“I love you,”

417
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:05,265
クレープに描く愛の傘の下で
Under the umbrella of love drawn on a crepe,

418
00:22:06,598 --> 00:22:09,265
止まぬ雨の音
The sound of endless rain,

419
00:22:09,598 --> 00:22:12,598
Je t'aime ★ Je t'aime

420
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:16,931
Mon Amour, pour toi

421
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:21,265
退屈な恋なんてしたくないわ
I don't want a boring love.

422
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:27,265
あっという間に溺れてく
I'm drowning in an instant.

423
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,598
“今がすべて”
“Now is everything,”

424
00:22:30,931 --> 00:22:36,265
カフェ・オ・レが冷めてしまうその前に
Before the café au lait gets cold,

425
00:22:38,598 --> 00:22:40,598
もう一度聴かせて
Let me hear it once more,

426
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:43,931
Je t'aime ★ Je t'aime

427
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:20,598
Bau Bau!

428
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:22,431
Wow, look at the sunset!

429
00:23:22,431 --> 00:23:24,765
Oh, it's setting already.

430
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:27,098
Perfect timing!

431
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:30,931
Well, that last song was "Je t'aime ★ Je t'aime".

432
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:33,265
What did you think, Mococo?

433
00:23:33,265 --> 00:23:35,098
What'd you think, Ruffians?

434
00:23:35,098 --> 00:23:37,098
It's a little bit more nostalgic.

435
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:39,431
Yeah, maybe even a bit melancholic of a song.

436
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:42,431
You know, some city pop vibes too!

437
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:44,931
Yeah! And the choreography's cute too, right?

438
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:50,931
Well, we hope it made you feel nice and warm and fluffy, Ruffians!

439
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,265
You know, with the sun setting now,

440
00:23:56,265 --> 00:24:00,265
it's starting to feel a bit romantic almost, right?

441
00:24:00,931 --> 00:24:03,931
Well, I guess it's the perfect time to call out my next guest!

442
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:05,931
Yeah! Here we go!

443
00:24:06,265 --> 00:24:10,265

00:24:55,265 --> 00:24:57,098
ありがとうございます！
Thank you so much!

461
00:24:57,265 --> 00:25:01,098
We actually have a special song that we want to perform with you!

462
00:25:03,313 --> 00:25:08,913
アキロゼ先輩とあずき先輩はとっても魅力的なお姉さんたちなので...
Aki-rose-senpai and AZKi-senpai are such charming older sisters, so...

463
00:25:09,313 --> 00:25:10,613
あら、あら
Oh my, oh my.

464
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:14,913
一緒にこの曲で行こうかなと思いました！
I thought we should do this song together!

465
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,613
ちょっとね、日も暮れてますし
The sun is starting to set a bit...

466
00:25:17,813 --> 00:25:19,913
確かにちょっと夕方...
True, it's getting toward evening...

467
00:25:20,013 --> 00:25:22,613
ロマンチックになりましたね
It's become quite romantic, hasn't it?

468
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:25,613
実はちょっぴりセクシーかも？
Actually, it might even be a little sexy?

469
00:25:25,713 --> 00:25:27,113
セクシーかも！
Maybe sexy!

470
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:29,613
セクシーな曲？
A sexy song?

471
00:25:29,713 --> 00:25:32,613
お願いしたことがあるみたいなんですけど...
It seems like I have a request for you...

472
00:25:32,913 --> 00:25:40,613
アキロゼ先輩、えっと、この曲を歌う前に少しあの... セクシーなウォーミングアップ...
Aki-rose-senpai, um, before we sing this song, a little... sexy warm-up...

473
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:44,113
いいですか？いいですか？
Is that okay? Is that okay?

474
00:25:44,313 --> 00:25:47,113
セクシーウォーミングアップ！OK！
Sexy warm-up! OK!

475
00:25:49,613 --> 00:25:53,113
じゃあまずセクシーな体を作るために...
Well then, first, to shape a sexy body...

476
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:55,613
自分のボディをなでて...
Stroke your own body...

477
00:25:56,113 --> 00:26:05,613
なでて！なでて！頭なでて！足から！足から！
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke your head! From your feet! From your feet!

478
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:09,113
なでてみて！なでてみて！
Try stroking! Try stroking!

479
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:11,613
はずい！
Embarrassing!

480
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,613
アキロゼ先輩みたいに！
Like Aki-rose-senpai!

481
00:26:15,113 --> 00:26:19,613
モコちゃん可愛いよ！オッケーいいよ！
Moco-chan is so cute! Okay, good!

482
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:28,113
なでるのがセクシー。足から、足から。
Stroking is sexy. From the feet, from the feet.

483
00:26:29,613 --> 00:26:32,613
もう一回、もう一回！
One more time, one more time!

484
00:26:36,613 --> 00:26:42,113
あずきちゃんもなんかセクシーだけど可愛い、ちょっと可愛いなと思いました
AZKi-chan is also somehow sexy but cute, I thought she was a bit cute.

485
00:26:42,213 --> 00:26:46,113
やっぱりこうやって...
As expected, like this...

486
00:26:53,213 --> 00:27:00,113
尻尾、尻尾も！尻尾フリフリも！
The tail, the tail too! Wag your tail too!

487
00:27:00,213 --> 00:27:07,113
ウォーミングアップ、ウォーミングアップ！
Warm-up, warm-up!

488
00:27:07,213 --> 00:27:11,613
いいんじゃない、いいんじゃない。オッケーできた！
Isn't it good, isn't it good? Okay, done!

489
00:27:14,613 --> 00:27:18,113
いい感じになりましたね！
It's looking good now!

490
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:21,613
じゃあ、次の曲行きましょうか！はい！

This love will burn out completely

541
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:08,468
どんな結末が来ようと 覚悟してる
I'm prepared for whatever end may come

542
00:32:10,468 --> 00:32:14,468
余裕なんて ほとんど無い
I have almost no composure left

543
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:19,968
必死でしがみついてるだけ
I'm just desperately clinging on

544
00:32:22,468 --> 00:32:28,768
あなたの目 優しく抱き寄せる腕
Your eyes, your arms gently pulling me close

545
00:32:28,968 --> 00:32:37,168
全てが 全てが 初めてだもん I'm fallen as a star

Kiss me 自然なままで
Kiss me, just as you are naturally

548

この不安も拭い取ってね
Please wipe away this anxiety too

549
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:54,968
ねえ ねえ ねえ ねえ...
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

Touch me with that gaze

寂しすぎて 正直怖い
It's so lonely, honestly it's scary

558
00:33:46,768 --> 00:33:52,468
二人でいれないこの時が
This time when we can't be together

559
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:59,768
雨の朝 暖かな部屋でコーヒー
A rainy morning, coffee in a warm room

560
00:34:00,468 --> 00:34:07,468
大人のフリから 本当の大人になりそう
From pretending to be an adult, I feel like I'm becoming a real one

561
00:34:09,968 --> 00:34:12,968
Kiss me 危険なほど
Kiss me, so much it's dangerous

00:34:44,968 --> 00:34:49,468
愛してる
I love you

570

Kiss me

571
00:35:07,662 --> 00:35:10,209
いけないほど
To an extent I shouldn't

572
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:10,809
Kiss me

573
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:13,359

Knock me

578
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:31,009

Are you ready?

583

One, two, jump!

584
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:33,209
Please enjoy Triangle Dreamer!

585
00:36:34,209 --> 00:36:39,109
Day by day 日々に日々に 募るの片想い
Day by day, day by day, my unrequited love grows

586
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:45,009
同じクラスなのに 目眩の遠い人
Even though we're in the same class, he feels so dizzyingly far

587
00:36:45,509 --> 00:36:51,009
カッコよくはない だけど優しい いつも頼れる彼
He's not cool, but he's kind, a guy I can always count on

588
00:36:56,309 --> 00:37:01,209
放課後 下校途中の帰り道
On the way home after school

589
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:07,009
何だって話せる 親友の女の子
My best friend, a girl I can talk to about anything

590
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:12,509
スポーツ万能 勉強もできて 女子力 MAXです
Great at sports, smart in school, her girl power is at its max

591
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:23,009
どこにでもある よくあること
It's something you see anywhere, a common occurrence

592
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,909
急に彼女が
Suddenly, she says...

593
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:30,209
「あのね、実は私、好きな人がいるの」
“Um, actually, there's someone I like.”

594
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:32,009
「ちょ、マジで！？」
“Wait, seriously!?”

595
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:37,009
三角形 三角形の恋はきまぐれ
Triangle, a triangle love is fickle

596
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:42,709
一瞬で 一瞬で崩れるバランス
In an instant, the balance breaks in a single moment

597
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:48,209
ベタな漫画みたいなフラグ
A cliché flag just like in a manga

598
00:37:49,009 --> 00:37:52,009
まさかね 自分が立てちゃうなんて
I can't believe I'm the one setting it off

599
00:37:52,009 --> 00:37:54,009
残念すぎます！
This is so unfortunate!

600
00:37:54,609 --> 00:38:00,009
三角形 三角形の恋は不安定
Triangle, a triangle love is unstable

601
00:38:00,209 --> 00:38:02,009
なんちゃって
Just kidding...

602
00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:05,009
なんちゃってじゃ済まないカテゴリー
It's a category where “just kidding” won't cut it

603
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:10,709
恋と友情 ゆらゆらめいて
Love and friendship, wavering back and forth

604
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:15,709
なんか青春しちゃいます
It feels like a youth drama

605
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:20,209
わたし 困っちゃいます
I'm at a loss

606
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:47,009
完敗です お似合いすぎるわ 勝てっこない
A complete defeat, you two look too good together, I can't win

607
00:38:47,509 --> 00:38:52,509
悔しいけど どこかそんなんじゃなくて本心
It's frustrating, but somehow it's not like that, it's my true heart

608
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:58,109
っていうか既に 応援モード
Actually, I'm already in cheering mode

609
00:38:58,709 --> 00:39:03,709
むしろ 清々しい
In fact, it's quite refreshing

610
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:09,409
だけど彼女は不思議な顔
But she has a strange look on her face

611
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:12,909
真剣な目で
With serious eyes...

612
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:17,209
「そうじゃなくて私、あなたが好き、ごめん」って
She says, “That's not it, I like you, sorry.”

613
00:39:17,509 --> 00:39:18,509
「え、マジで！？」
“Eh, seriously!?”

わたし
Me

617
00:39:30,009 --> 00:39:31,009
アナタ
You

618
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:34,209

Her and me

619
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:40,009
超絶！複雑！百合展開は想定外です！

623
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:56,709
解けないパズル 与えたもうた
An unsolvable puzzle given to us

624
00:39:57,009 --> 00:40:00,709
神よ 恨んじゃいます
Oh God, I resent you for this

625
00:40:02,057 --> 00:40:03,357
わたし
I...

626
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:06,257
悩んじゃいます
...am worrying!

627
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:09,757
あー、もうすごいヤバい！
Ah, this is getting crazy!

628
00:40:09,757 --> 00:40:11,357
好きだよ、好きだけど、
I like you, I do like you,

629
00:40:11,357 --> 00:40:12,557
ってそういう意味じゃなくって！
but I don't mean it in that way!

630
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:15,357
だって女の子同士だし！
I mean, we're both girls!

631
00:40:15,357 --> 00:40:17,957
ねぇ神様、どうしたらいいの？
Hey God, what should I do?

632
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:20,457
わたし、どうしたいの？
What do I want to do?

633
00:40:20,557 --> 00:40:21,857
HELP ME!

634
00:40:22,157 --> 00:40:24,557
なんか変だ 合いも故郷も
Something's strange. Love, hometown,

635
00:40:24,557 --> 00:40:27,657
年も性別も関係ない
age, and gender don't matter.

636
00:40:28,157 --> 00:40:30,757

00:40:36,657 --> 00:40:39,057
一瞬で 一瞬でくずれる
In an instant, in an instant,

640
00:40:39,057 --> 00:40:41,457
バランス
the balance collapses.

641
00:40:42,457 --> 00:40:45,057
普通の恋
Ordinary love...

642

普通の恋 夢みてたのに
I was dreaming of an ordinary love,

643
00:40:47,857 --> 00:40:50,357
ノーマル設定のわたしじゃちょっと
but for me with normal settings,

644
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:52,857
無理ゲーすぎます
it's too much of an impossible game.

645

三角形 三角形の恋は
Triangle, triangle love...

646
00:40:56,057 --> 00:40:58,457
不安定
...is unstable.

647
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:01,357
なんちゃって なんちゃってじゃ
"Just kidding" is a category...

648
00:41:01,357 --> 00:41:03,857
済まないカテゴリー
...you can't just brush off.

649
00:41:04,457 --> 00:41:07,157
彼女のこと
If I could come...

650
00:41:07,157 --> 00:41:09,457
好きになれたなら
...to like her...

651
00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:12,457
なんて妄想
...is the kind of delusion...

652
00:41:12,457 --> 00:41:14,657
しちゃいます
...I'm having.

653
00:41:15,257 --> 00:41:16,657
わたし
Something's...

654
00:41:16,657 --> 00:41:19,857
どうかしてます
...wrong with me.

655
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:23,257
行くよー！
Here we go!

656
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:44,557
バウバウ！
Bau Bau!

657
00:41:48,057 --> 00:41:49,857
Wow, Ruffians!

658
00:41:56,657 --> 00:41:58,557
Ruffians!

659
00:42:16,557 --> 00:42:18,857
Bau Bau! Thank you, Ruffians!

660
00:42:19,557 --> 00:42:21,457
That was so much fun!

661
00:42:22,557 --> 00:42:25,057
Yeah, you know, I got a bit dizzy though.

662
00:42:25,757 --> 00:42:29,257
With the bubbles and changing so quickly!

663
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:31,357
Nice and fast!

664
00:42:31,857 --> 00:42:34,457
Yeah, you know, up in the bubble there,

665
00:42:34,457 --> 00:42:36,057
it was a little bit silly!

666
00:42:36,257 --> 00:42:38,557
But did we surprise you?

667
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:42,457
And we got to see you as well, even more close up than usual!

668
00:42:42,857 --> 00:42:46,257
Yeah! Wow, those last two songs we sang were...

669
00:42:46,257 --> 00:42:49,357
"Kiss Me I'll Stayed" together with Okayu-senpai...

670
00:42:49,357 --> 00:42:53,357
...and "Triangle Dreamer" with Okayu-senpai,

671
00:42:53,357 --> 00:42:55,657
Mio-senpai, and Subaru-senpai!

672
00:42:56,057 --> 00:42:58,257
What'd you think, Ruffians?

673
00:42:58,257 --> 00:43:02,657
"Kiss Me I'll Stayed" is a song I've always wanted to sing together with Okayu-senpai!

674
00:43:03,357 --> 00:43:06,257
Yeah, it's a little bit more sexy!

675
00:43:06,257 --> 00:43:08,557
A bit of a sexy song, huh? Yeah!

676
00:43:08,857 --> 00:43:10,857
And "Triangle Dreamer"!

677
00:43:10,857 --> 00:43:14,357
Yeah, the best of idol songs!

678
00:43:14,557 --> 00:43:17,357
The choreography was so cute!

679
00:43:17,357 --> 00:43:19,457
Ruffians, are you still alive?

680
00:43:19,557 --> 00:43:21,457
Alive?

681
00:43:21,457 --> 00:43:24,057
Yeah! Bau Bau!

682
00:43:24,257 --> 00:43:28,057
All of our senpai were so cute in person!

683
00:43:28,257 --> 00:43:29,657
Bau Bau!

684
00:43:29,757 --> 00:43:33,257
And getting to jump in the bubble!

685
00:43:33,257 --> 00:43:35,257
Yeah! It was a blast!

686
00:43:35,757 --> 00:43:38,757
A lot of firsts this year, right?

687
00:43:39,357 --> 00:43:43,057
Yeah! Well, we have a tiny, tiny announcement.

688
00:43:43,557 --> 00:43:46,257
You know, it's FUWAMOCO's birthday, right?

689
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:48,357
Our birthday!

690
00:43:48,757 --> 00:43:51,857
And so, we have something we'd like to share with you!

691
00:43:52,057 --> 00:43:54,657
Ready? Okay! Do-don-don!

692
00:43:55,057 --> 00:43:56,657
Bau Bau!

693
00:43:56,857 --> 00:44:00,257
It's time to celebrate both of our birthdays...

694
00:44:00,257 --> 00:44:03,357
...with our FUWAMOCO 2026 Birthday Merch!

695
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,857
FUWAMOCOの生誕グッズ紹介、
FUWAMOCO's birthday merch introduction...

696
00:44:05,857 --> 00:44:08,057
始まるよー！
...is starting!

697
00:44:08,257 --> 00:44:10,557
First, we became fluffy and fuzzy idols with the...

698
00:44:10,557 --> 00:44:15,257
...Fuwa Fuwa Idol Fuwawa and Moco Moco Idol Mococo acrylic stands!

699
00:44:15,357 --> 00:44:18,857
Drawn by our mama, Icomochi-mama!

700
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:22,557
They're rather big compared to

701
00:44:22,557 --> 00:44:25,557
regular acrylic stands, so we think

702
00:44:25,557 --> 00:44:29,357
they'll be a great addition to your collection. Big size and cute!

703
00:44:30,057 --> 00:44:33,057
Next, we have the silly Ehehe Angel and

704
00:44:33,057 --> 00:44:35,857
Hoeh?! Devil rubber figurines!

705
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:39,357
We're now palm-sized figures perfect for

706
00:44:39,357 --> 00:44:44,557
displaying on your desk. In our Halloween outfits!

707
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,057
This one is big!

708
00:44:47,057 --> 00:44:51,057
We finally have FUWAMOCO plushies in our

709
00:44:51,057 --> 00:44:54,557
out-and-about casual outfits!

710
00:44:54,557 --> 00:44:57,557
But this time, we also speak when you hug us!

711
00:44:58,057 --> 00:45:01,057
It's the Yappy Puppy FUWAMOCO Sounds Plushies!

712
00:45:02,472 --> 00:45:03,772
おしゃべりぱぴー☆
Chatty Puppy☆

713
00:45:03,772 --> 00:45:05,272

00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:10,972

717
00:45:10,972 --> 00:45:14,272
We have the Fuwawa to GO☆Finger Puppet!

718
00:45:14,272 --> 00:45:16,072
Whoa!

719
00:45:16,072 --> 00:45:21,872
They both come with one extra Ruffian kigurumi costume you can dress up in and bring around with you everywhere!

720
00:45:21,872 --> 00:45:23,972
ふわわ の 指パペット！
Fuwawa's finger puppet!

721
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:28,972
どこでも 一緒に 連れていける サイズ で 着せ替え ラフィアンズ 衣装 も あるよ！
It's a size you can take with you anywhere, and there's also a Ruffians costume to change into!

722
00:45:28,972 --> 00:45:33,272
Finally, we have two different ASMR voice packs,

723
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,672
"Back from a Fluffy Date♡" with Fuwawa,

724
00:45:35,672 --> 00:45:39,772
and "Sweet and Fuzzy Needy Puppy" from Mococo!

725
00:45:39,772 --> 00:45:44,272
ASMRボイス は 英語 と 日本語 両方 で 収録 してます！
The ASMR voices are recorded in both English and Japanese!

726
00:45:44,272 --> 00:45:46,672
They made our hearts beat so fast!

727
00:45:46,672 --> 00:45:49,272
Be ready to blush when you take a listen to them! Ugh!

728
00:45:49,272 --> 00:45:52,872
The merch is separated into two sets,

729
00:45:52,872 --> 00:45:55,772
Fuwawa's Birthday Merch and Mococo's Birthday Merch!

730
00:45:55,772 --> 00:45:59,472
If you purchase the full set, they come with bonuses,

731
00:45:59,472 --> 00:46:02,972
including a cheki-style card with a special bonus voice!

732
00:46:02,972 --> 00:46:06,772

The merch is split into a Fuwawa set and a Mococo set!

Each set comes with a cheki-style card and a bonus voice!

734
00:46:11,172 --> 00:46:17,072
The regular version will have a foil-stamped replica signature and message, so it'll be just as cute!

735
00:46:17,072 --> 00:46:20,472
数量限定セット は 直筆サイン 入り だよ！
The limited edition set includes a hand-signed autograph!

745
00:47:14,272 --> 00:47:20,472
Well, we performed more special collab songs with our dear senpais...

746
00:47:20,472 --> 00:47:24,472
...but there's still one mystery guest we haven't met yet, right?

747
00:47:24,472 --> 00:47:29,272
そう！ まだ 会ってない 謎のゲスト が 一人 いるんだよね！
That's right! There's still one mystery guest we haven't met yet!

748
00:47:29,272 --> 00:47:31,972
Well, shall we give the Ruffians a hint?

749
00:47:31,972 --> 00:47:35,272
Ruffians, are you curious? Bau bau!

750
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:38,272
Could it be...? Could it be...?

751
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,972
YAGOO-san? That's a good guess maybe!

752
00:47:40,972 --> 00:47:43,772
But we'll see, huh?

753
00:47:43,772 --> 00:47:46,672
Maybe you should get ready...

754
00:47:46,672 --> 00:47:54,972
...because, you know, they aren't quite as bad as Pero, but they can get pretty nasty sometimes! Oh!

755
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:59,472
Mococo-chan, you shouldn't be rude to our next guest or anything, right?

756
00:47:59,472 --> 00:48:02,472
Especially before calling them out!

757
00:48:02,472 --> 00:48:04,472
We'll see!

758
00:48:04,472 --> 00:48:07,972
Well, let's get them out here then!

759
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:10,472
Who could it be? Who could it be?

760
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:12,472
Okay! せーの！
Okay! One, two!

761

Wait, um, I think there are many Ruffians watching, but could you explain what kind of person Kuro-chan is?

ちょっとフワモコのペットの、ペロちゃんと、えっと、ちょっと似てるところが、たくさんあるね。
You have a lot of similarities with FuwaMoco's pet, Pero-chan.

802
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,327
えっ、どこ？
Wait, where?

Look at him behind us. Can you see him?

00:50:35,627 --> 00:50:37,727
そっくりですよ。ペロです。
He's just like you. It's Pero.

805
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:41,427
ちょっと待って。球体というか、丸いところが似てるだけじゃない？ねえ。
Hold on. Isn't it just the spherical... I mean, the roundness that's similar? Hey.

806
00:50:41,827 --> 00:50:43,027
それじゃない！
That's not it!

807
00:50:43,127 --> 00:50:43,927
本当？
Really?

808
00:50:44,427 --> 00:50:46,627
えっと、クロちゃんと似てるところは...
Um, the parts that are similar to Kuro-chan are...

809
00:50:46,827 --> 00:50:50,227
嘘つきで、女の子好きで、やらしくて...
Being a liar, liking girls, and being lecherous...

810
00:50:50,427 --> 00:50:51,727
うん！
Yeah!

811
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:54,227
だからね、見た目で騙されないで。
So, don't be fooled by appearances.

812
00:50:54,327 --> 00:50:56,727
クロちゃん、そんなんで大丈夫なの？言われて。
Kuro-chan, are you okay with being told that?

813
00:50:57,027 --> 00:51:01,027
いや、ひどい。悲しくなってきた。えーん、えーん、えーん。
No, that's terrible. I'm getting sad. Waah, waah, waah.

814
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:02,727
エンポイポイフン！
En-poi-poi-fun!

815
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:04,727
ええー！？
Eeeh?!

816
00:51:05,027 --> 00:51:08,427
全然人のギャグ聞かないよね、君たちは。
You guys don't listen to my jokes at all.

817
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:14,527
できれば、クロちゃんはペロの友達になってくれませんか？
If possible, would Kuro-chan like to be Pero's friend?

818
00:51:14,727 --> 00:51:17,827
フワモコの友達じゃなくてペロの友達なの？
Pero's friend, not FuwaMoco's friend?

819
00:51:18,027 --> 00:51:21,327
そう。フワモコはクロちゃんと友達になりたくないから。
Yeah. Because FuwaMoco doesn't want to be friends with Kuro-chan.

820
00:51:21,427 --> 00:51:23,027
おかしくない、それ？
Isn't that weird?

821
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:25,427
いやいや、気持ち悪いから！
No, no, because it's gross!

822
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:28,227
いや、気持ち悪くない。マニアには受ける。
No, it's not gross. Maniacs love it.

823
00:51:28,427 --> 00:51:30,827
違う。フワ、気持ち悪い、やっぱり。
No. Fuwa thinks it's gross, after all.

824
00:51:31,527 --> 00:51:35,227
でも、モコちゃん、ちょっとやりすぎですよ。失礼です。
But, Moco-chan, that's going a bit too far. It's rude.

825
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:42,827
いや、もし、もし、ペロと仲良くなってほしいんだったら、フワモコちゃん、クロちゃんにかわいらしく頼んだほうがいいんじゃない？
Well, if you want me to get along with Pero, shouldn't FuwaMoco-chan ask Kuro-chan in a cute way?

826
00:51:43,127 --> 00:51:44,127
はあ？
Huh?

827
00:51:44,427 --> 00:51:45,427
NO!

828
00:51:45,527 --> 00:51:46,027
えっ、NO？
Eh, NO?

829
00:51:46,127 --> 00:51:47,027
NO!

830
00:51:47,227 --> 00:51:48,827
しっかりとした否定。
A very firm denial.

831
00:51:49,227 --> 00:51:53,227
えっ、まあ、けど、ペロ可愛いから仲良くなってもいいと思ってるよ。
Well, Pero is cute, so I think I'm okay with getting along.

832
00:51:53,427 --> 00:51:55,327
あー、嬉しい！嬉しい嬉しい！
Ah, happy! Happy, happy!

833
00:51:55,527 --> 00:51:59,227
可愛くないけど、なんか仲良くなってくれたら嬉しいかな？
He's not cute, but I'd be happy if you got along with him.

834
00:51:59,527 --> 00:52:02,527
感情が、感情がいろいろありすぎるのよ、本当。
There are just too many emotions going on, really.

835
00:52:02,927 --> 00:52:09,027
まあ、まあ。クロちゃんって芸人さんだけど、アイドルになりたいんですよね？
Well, well. Kuro-chan, you're a comedian, but you want to be an idol, right?

836
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:09,827
ねー。
Right?

837
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:17,427
そう。もともとアイドルになろうと思ったのに、騙されて芸人にさせられたから、アイドルは本当に夢。ドリーム。
Yeah. I originally wanted to be an idol, but I was tricked into being a comedian. So being an idol is truly my dream. My dream.

838
00:52:17,727 --> 00:52:20,327
あー、悲しいね。かわいそう。
Ah, how sad. Poor thing.

839
00:52:20,527 --> 00:52:22,027
でも、ドリームって大事ですから。
But dreams are important.

840
00:52:22,327 --> 00:52:23,227
大事！
Important!

841
00:52:23,427 --> 00:52:23,927
うん。
Yeah.

842
00:52:24,027 --> 00:52:28,027
さあ、で、まあ、クロちゃんのドリームはアイドルなんだから...
So, since Kuro-chan's dream is to be an idol...

843
00:52:28,227 --> 00:52:31,827
もうせっかく、一緒に歌ってくれませんか？
Since we're here, why don't you sing with us?

844
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:36,627
あ、いいしんよ、いいしんよ！オッケーだしんよ！歌って踊れるしんよ。
Ah, that's fine, shin! It's okay! I can sing and dance, shin!

845
00:52:36,827 --> 00:52:37,527
え、何？
Eh, what?

846
00:52:37,727 --> 00:52:39,327
うん、この曲、ドリームの曲ね。
Yeah, this song is a dream song.

847
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:41,127
あの、ハードル上げないで。
Um, don't raise the stakes too high.

848
00:52:41,327 --> 00:52:43,827
えー、大丈夫ですよ。ねー。
Eh, it'll be fine. Right?

849
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:45,927
アイドルのプロデュースもやってるし。
You also produce idols.

850
00:52:46,127 --> 00:52:48,027
そうそう、実力見せてよ！
Yeah, show us your talent!

851
00:52:48,227 --> 00:52:49,027
見せて！
Show us!

852
00:52:49,227 --> 00:52:51,827
オッケーだしんよ。行くしんよ、行くしんよ。
It's okay, shin. Here I go, here I go, shin.

853
00:52:52,027 --> 00:52:53,527
オッケー！うん！
Okay! Yeah!

854
00:52:53,727 --> 00:52:57,827
じゃあ、すごく可愛い曲を一緒に歌いましょう！
Then, let's sing a very cute song together!

855
00:52:58,127 --> 00:52:59,827
えっ、何だろう。楽しみ。
Eh, I wonder what it is. I'm excited.

856
00:53:00,027 --> 00:53:02,027
オッケー。はーい。
Okay. Here we go.

857
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:05,027
じゃあ、一緒にタイトルコールしましょうね。
Then, let's do the title call together.

858
00:53:05,227 --> 00:53:05,827
うん。
Yeah.

859
00:53:06,127 --> 00:53:07,427
せーの！
One, two!

860
00:53:07,627 --> 00:53:09,127
ちゅ、多様性。
Chu, Tayousei.

861
00:53:09,327 --> 00:53:11,227
あ、多様性やるの？
Ah, we're doing Tayousei?

862
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,927
ちゅ、多様性。
Chu, Tayousei.

863
00:53:28,427 --> 00:53:31,527
我愛你　酔いが醒めない
I love you, the intoxication won't fade.

864
00:53:31,727 --> 00:53:34,727
Oh, I need you　恋が醒めない
Oh, I need you, the love won't fade.

865
00:53:35,127 --> 00:53:40,127
お生憎様の慣れ果て　唆して
A pitiful shadow of myself, entice me.

866
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:44,427
無問題　破滅してみて
No problem, try being ruined.

867
00:53:44,727 --> 00:53:47,727
Hold me tight　トラウマの味
Hold me tight, the taste of trauma.

868
00:53:47,927 --> 00:53:53,227
猛反対　お手お座りでハイ❤報酬
Strong opposition, give a hand, sit, and "here's your reward❤"

869
00:53:53,527 --> 00:53:56,727
喉の奥がジンジンジン
The back of my throat is tingling.

870
00:53:57,027 --> 00:54:00,027
僕はドクンドクン
My heart is thumping.

871
00:54:00,227 --> 00:54:05,727
鼓動で孤独消してみせてよ
Try erasing the loneliness with the heartbeat.

872
00:54:06,127 --> 00:54:09,327
愛も恋も度外視して
Disregarding both love and romance.

873
00:54:09,627 --> 00:54:12,427
僕を独占して
Monopolize me.

874
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:18,327
このまま中毒になるまでチューしよう
Let's keep kissing until we're addicted.

875
00:54:18,727 --> 00:54:20,227
Get get get on!

Get get get on chu!

879
00:54:25,127 --> 00:54:29,627
熱く　とろけるくらいに溢れた気持ちが
Feelings overflowing enough to melt with heat.

880
00:54:29,827 --> 00:54:31,727
たまらないでしょ
It's irresistible, right?

881
00:54:32,027 --> 00:54:35,027
Get get get on chu!

882
00:54:35,227 --> 00:54:37,127
Get get get on chu!

883
00:54:37,227 --> 00:54:40,527

Get get get on chu!

885
00:54:44,027 --> 00:54:47,027
ポン・チー・カン　勝負はいつも
Pon, Chii, Kan, the match is always...

886
00:54:47,227 --> 00:54:50,527
トンチンカン　僕に言わせて
Absurd, let me say it.

887
00:54:50,727 --> 00:54:56,027
ちんぷんかんぷんだ　最後はロンでしょ？
It's all Greek to me, the end is "Ron", right?

888
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:59,927
もう何回？　殺られればいい
How many more times? How many times should I be killed?

889
00:55:00,127 --> 00:55:01,927
Oh, one night 忘れられない
Oh, one night, I can't forget.

890
00:55:02,748 --> 00:55:07,848
終わんないトキメキ偏愛♡予習
Never-ending heart-throbbing partiality ♡ preview

891
00:55:08,248 --> 00:55:11,848
喉の奥がチクンチクン
A prickling sensation in the back of my throat

892
00:55:11,948 --> 00:55:14,848
僕はドクンドクン
My heart is thumping

893
00:55:14,948 --> 00:55:20,148
心臓ごと 引きずり出して見せてよ
Drag it all out, even my heart, and show me

894
00:55:20,248 --> 00:55:21,148
ってよ
...so they say.

895
00:55:21,248 --> 00:55:24,748
気持ちいい めんどくさいけど
It feels good, though it's a pain

896
00:55:24,848 --> 00:55:27,748
やっぱ照れくさいけど
And it's embarrassing after all

897
00:55:27,848 --> 00:55:33,648
死ぬまで忘れられないチューしよ
Let's share a kiss we'll never forget until we die

898
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:37,248
いかれた街はゾンビで溢れる
This crazy town is overflowing with zombies

899
00:55:37,348 --> 00:55:40,148
君は僕に恋してる
You're in love with me

900
00:55:40,248 --> 00:55:45,748
ときめく胸に繋がる導火線を引きなよ
Pull the fuse that connects to your throbbing chest

901

本気で狂えるくらいの愛おしさが
A love so intense it could drive you mad

906
00:55:57,748 --> 00:55:59,248

Is beautiful, isn't it?

907
00:55:59,348 --> 00:56:01,048

918
00:56:27,748 --> 00:56:30,748
ありがとうー！よかったー！
Thank you! I'm so glad!

919
00:56:30,748 --> 00:56:33,748
頑張ったね、クロちゃん！楽しかったー！ありがとうー！
You did your best, Kuro-chan! It was fun! Thank you!

920
00:56:33,748 --> 00:56:36,748
ありがとう！ Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

921
00:56:36,748 --> 00:56:39,748
え、ちょっとね、さよならする前に...
Actually, before we say goodbye...

922
00:56:39,748 --> 00:56:40,748
お、何？
Oh, what is it?

923
00:56:40,748 --> 00:56:42,748
えっと、1個お願いしてもいいですか？
Um, could we ask you one favor?

924
00:56:43,248 --> 00:56:44,748
1個だけだしんよー
Just one thing-shin!

925
00:56:45,248 --> 00:56:46,748
あー、1個だけじゃん！
Aw, just one thing!

926
00:56:46,748 --> 00:56:50,748
えっと、FUWAMOCOは魔界の番犬で、Bau Bauをよく言ってるんですけど...
Well, FUWAMOCO are guard dogs of the Underworld, and we often say 'Bau Bau'...

927
00:56:50,748 --> 00:56:56,748
クロちゃん、カメラに向かってFUWAMOCOのように可愛いBau Bauをしてもらえますか？
Kuro-chan, could you do a cute 'Bau Bau' for the camera like FUWAMOCO does?

928
00:56:57,248 --> 00:57:00,748
えー！できるかなぁ？
Eh! I wonder if I can do it?

929
00:57:01,248 --> 00:57:02,748
ほっ、ほっ！
Ho, ho!

930
00:57:03,748 --> 00:57:04,748
いくしんよ！
Here I go-shin!

931
00:57:05,248 --> 00:57:07,248
Bau Bau!

932
00:57:08,248 --> 00:57:10,248
へ？バウバウ...それがベスト？
Huh? Bau Bau... is that your best?

933
00:57:10,248 --> 00:57:12,748
えー、もう一回！もっとやって！
No, one more time! Give it more!

934
00:57:12,748 --> 00:57:14,748
はい、はい。んん〜
Okay, okay. Mmm~

935
00:57:14,748 --> 00:57:16,748
Bau Bau!

936
00:57:17,248 --> 00:57:19,248
可愛いかな？
Was that cute?

937
00:57:19,748 --> 00:57:23,248
えっと、実はもう一個やりたいことがあるんですけど...
Um, actually, there's one more thing I want to do...

938
00:57:23,748 --> 00:57:24,748
何？
What is it?

939
00:57:24,748 --> 00:57:30,248
さっきもやりましたけど、FUWAMOCOはいつもやってる自己紹介があって...
Like we did earlier, FUWAMOCO has a self-introduction we always do...

940
00:57:30,248 --> 00:57:33,248
できれば3人で一緒にやりたいです！
And if possible, I'd like to do it with all three of us!

941
00:57:33,248 --> 00:57:36,248
あ、あれ可愛かったからやりたいクロちゃんも！
Ah, that was cute, Kuro-chan wants to do it too!

942
00:57:36,248 --> 00:57:38,248
じゃあ行きますよー！ OK!
Then here we go! OK!

943
00:57:39,248 --> 00:57:41,748
チワワじゃないよ、フワワだよ！
Not a Chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

944
00:57:41,748 --> 00:57:44,748
フワワじゃないよ、クロちゃんだよ！
Not Fuwawa, I'm Kuro-chan!

945
00:57:44,748 --> 00:57:48,248
へ、クロちゃんじゃないよ、モココだよ！
Eh, not Kuro-chan, I'm Mococo!

946
00:57:48,248 --> 00:57:51,248
3人合わせて、FUWA... あ、いやいや...
And together we are FUWA... ah, wait, wait...

947
00:57:51,248 --> 00:57:54,248
アイヤイヤー！何で？怒んないで！どうしたの？
Aieee! Why? Don't be mad! What's wrong?

948
00:57:55,248 --> 00:57:58,248
ぜんぜんクロちゃん出てこないから何なのそれ！
Kuro-chan isn't supposed to be in it at all, what's with that!

949
00:57:58,248 --> 00:58:01,248
おい、もう嘘とかつくないよね！ 嘘じゃないよ...
Hey, stop telling lies already! It's not a lie...

950
00:58:01,248 --> 00:58:03,248
おい、一歩前！
Hey, step forward!

951
00:58:03,248 --> 00:58:05,248
モココ・パーンチ！

いらないよ！もう嘘！
We don't need one! Stop lying!

955
00:58:15,248 --> 00:58:18,248
嘘じゃないってばー！Bau Bau! 何でBau Bau怒んのちょっと！
I'm telling you, it's not a lie! Bau Bau! Why are you mad at Bau Bau?!

956
00:58:18,748 --> 00:58:21,248
落ち着いて、落ち着いて... 何でー...
Calm down, calm down... But why...

957
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:24,748
大丈夫、モコちゃん、大丈夫。
It's okay, Moco-chan, it's okay.

958
00:58:24,748 --> 00:58:30,748
じゃあ、クロちゃんはこれからもみんなをいっぱい笑顔にして、素敵なアイドルになってくださいね！
Well, Kuro-chan, please keep making everyone smile and become a wonderful idol!

959
00:58:30,748 --> 00:58:32,748
だしんよー！
I will-shin!

960
00:58:32,748 --> 00:58:34,248
Bau Bau!

961
00:58:34,248 --> 00:58:38,748
じゃあモコちゃん、最後にクロちゃんにハイタッチしてお別れしようね！ オッケー！
Then Moco-chan, let's give Kuro-chan a high-five and say goodbye! Okay!

962
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:41,748
仲直り、仲直り... 仲直りだしん？
Make up, make up... We're making up-shin?

963
00:58:42,248 --> 00:58:43,748
オッケーだしんよ、ハイタッチ！
It's okay-shin, high-five!

964
00:58:44,248 --> 00:58:46,248
ほら、ほら、ほら...
Come on, come on, come on...

965
00:58:54,748 --> 00:58:56,748
バッ！ あーっ！ちょっとー！
Bwah! Ah! Wait a minute!

966
00:58:56,748 --> 00:58:59,248
ひどくないもー、ちょっと、何なのー。
That's mean! Hey, what was that for?!

967
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:03,748
けど、FUWAMOCOちゃん、本当にお誕生日おめでとうございまーす！
But FUWAMOCO-chan, a very happy birthday to you!

00:59:12,748 --> 00:59:14,748
S-Stay tuned!

972
00:59:20,748 --> 00:59:24,748
Fireworks! Beautiful fireworks! Yeah!

973
00:59:24,748 --> 00:59:28,748
たまやー！かぎやー！Bau Bau!
Tamaya-! Kagaya-! Bau Bau!

974
00:59:29,748 --> 00:59:32,748
Wow! That was so high!

975
00:59:32,748 --> 00:59:36,748
Things kind of got really crazy, I'm not too sure what happened.

976
00:59:36,748 --> 00:59:40,748
クロちゃんすごすぎて、わからなくなってきたかも...
Kuro-chan was so intense, I might have lost track of things...

977
00:59:40,748 --> 00:59:43,748
But we still have one more thing, one more very exciting thing to share with you!

978
00:59:43,748 --> 00:59:48,748
まだまだ楽しみがあるよ！
There's still more to look forward to!

979
00:59:49,748 --> 00:59:53,748
Wow... maybe Ruffians, can you guess what it is?

980
00:59:53,748 --> 00:59:56,748
何かな？何かな？
What could it be? What could it be?

981
00:59:57,748 --> 01:00:02,748
Wow... FUWAMOCO and our 1st anniversary...

982
01:00:01,529 --> 01:00:06,029
And at last we were able to release
our first original song, "Bring It On!"

983
01:00:06,529 --> 01:00:10,829
And then for our second anniversary, we were
able to release "Lifetime Showtime!"

984
01:00:11,029 --> 01:00:16,029
Our original song that's grown with us
along this journey, a very special song.

985
01:00:17,029 --> 01:00:22,029
And you know, for FUWAMOCO, singing and
dancing is something that means so much to us!

986
01:00:22,529 --> 01:00:24,529
Yeah, music!

987
01:00:25,529 --> 01:00:29,529
And Ruffians, you might have heard that
you'd like to hear more from us too, right?

988
01:00:29,629 --> 01:00:32,529
Yeah! Yeah! What do you think? Yeah!

989
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:37,029
Well... our announcement is...

990
01:00:38,029 --> 01:00:41,029
Drumroll! Okay, drumroll please!

991
01:00:41,529 --> 01:00:46,529
Bau bau bau bau bau...

992
01:00:46,629 --> 01:00:49,529
DA-DAN! A new original song!

993
01:00:50,029 --> 01:00:53,529
Yeah! 新しいオリ曲！
Yeah! A new original song!

994
01:00:54,529 --> 01:00:57,029
And this song is extra special!

995
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:02,029
It's written by none other than the legendary
rock idol song composer Matsukuma Kenta-san,

996
01:01:02,529 --> 01:01:07,529
who's worked with many famous idol groups
so we love, also writing music for the

997
01:01:08,029 --> 01:01:13,029
idol group that Kuro-chan produces,
MAMESHIBA NO TAIGUN!

998
01:01:14,029 --> 01:01:18,029
But Ruffians, you might be
a little bit surprised, okay?

999
01:01:18,529 --> 01:01:20,529
So get ready!

1000
01:01:21,529 --> 01:01:26,529
Ruffians, with this song, we'd like to express
our deepest feelings as demon dogs.

1001
01:01:30,029 --> 01:01:32,529
DEMON'S RESIDENCE.

1002
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,629
「相棒、どこへ行こうか」
"Partner, where shall we go?"

1003
01:01:58,629 --> 01:02:01,029
ネオンの脇を抜け
Slipping past the neon lights

1004
01:02:01,529 --> 01:02:03,629
バブルガムがはじけたら
Once the bubblegum pops

1005
01:02:03,629 --> 01:02:06,029
let's go

1006
01:02:06,629 --> 01:02:08,929
最低な夜を潜って
Diving through the lowest of nights

1007
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:11,429
僕らは群れをなす
We form a pack

1008
01:02:11,529 --> 01:02:13,829
「あの頃よりもマシだね」
"It's better than back then, isn't it?"

1009
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:16,029
my way

1010
01:02:16,629 --> 01:02:19,029
「不完全なんです」
"It's incomplete"

1011
01:02:19,029 --> 01:02:21,629
首輪をつけた
Wearing a collar

1012
01:02:21,629 --> 01:02:24,129
良い子なんかんじゃもう
If it's just about being a good girl, then

1013
01:02:24,529 --> 01:02:26,629
イ　ヤ
NO WAY

1014
01:02:26,629 --> 01:02:27,829
Ah!!

1015
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:28,929
DEMON'S RESIDENCE

1016
01:02:28,929 --> 01:02:29,929
噛みついていけ
Bite your way through

1017
01:02:29,929 --> 01:02:31,929
この街は檻のようで
This city is like a cage

1018
01:02:31,929 --> 01:02:33,029
気分はどうだい
How are you feeling?

1019
01:02:33,029 --> 01:02:34,729
泣いているのかい
Are you crying?

1020
01:02:34,729 --> 01:02:36,229
鎖をちぎって
Tear off the chains

1021
01:02:36,229 --> 01:02:38,029
叫んでいたいんだ
I want to keep shouting

1022
01:02:38,029 --> 01:02:39,229
stray dogs

1023
01:02:39,229 --> 01:02:40,629
彼方へと
To the beyond

1024
01:02:40,629 --> 01:02:41,929
飛ぶ鳥を
At the flying birds

1025
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:43,329
見上げるだけかい
Are you just looking up?

1026
01:02:43,329 --> 01:02:44,529
それでいいのかい
Is that really okay?

1027
01:02:44,529 --> 01:02:46,329
震えるなら
If you're trembling

1028
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:50,529
ほら青く
Look, turn blue

1029
01:02:57,529 --> 01:02:59,729
「説教なんかはいらない」
"I don't need any preaching"

1030
01:02:59,729 --> 01:03:01,629
スプレー缶振って
Shaking the spray can

1031
01:03:01,629 --> 01:03:03,629
イタズラ書きで
With graffiti

1032
01:03:03,629 --> 01:03:07,029
彩る runway
Color the runway

1033
01:03:07,629 --> 01:03:10,029
愛情なんか coin toss
Affection is just a coin toss

1034
01:03:10,029 --> 01:03:12,029
誰に bet するのか
Who are you betting on?

1035
01:03:12,029 --> 01:03:15,029
不確定要素ばかりね
It's nothing but uncertainties

1036
01:03:15,029 --> 01:03:17,329
lonely

1037
01:03:18,329 --> 01:03:20,329
二人で
The two of us

1038
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:23,329
ひとつと決めた
Decided to be as one

1039
01:03:23,529 --> 01:03:27,529
あの日を忘れない
I won't forget that day

1040
01:03:27,629 --> 01:03:28,729
Ah!!

1041
01:03:28,729 --> 01:03:29,929
DEMON'S RESIDENCE

1042
01:03:29,929 --> 01:03:31,629
満天の空
A star-filled sky

1043
01:03:31,629 --> 01:03:33,929
あの星がひどく不快で
Those stars are terribly unpleasant

1044
01:03:33,929 --> 01:03:34,929
勝利はどうだい
How's victory?

1045
01:03:34,929 --> 01:03:36,029
味がするのかい
Does it have a taste?

1046
01:03:36,029 --> 01:03:37,329
鎖を噛んで
Biting the chains

1047
01:03:37,329 --> 01:03:39,329
唸っていたいんだ
I want to keep growling

1048
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:40,629
stray dogs

1049
01:03:40,629 --> 01:03:42,729
僕ら宇宙さえも
Even the universe

1050
01:03:42,729 --> 01:03:43,929
撃ち落として
We'll shoot it down

1051
01:03:43,929 --> 01:03:45,129
見下ろす奈落
Looking down into the abyss

1052
01:03:45,129 --> 01:03:46,529
ビルは輝く
Buildings are shining

1053
01:03:46,529 --> 01:03:49,329
LOL Now I am

1054
01:03:49,329 --> 01:03:53,529
free!!

1055
01:04:04,529 --> 01:04:14,029
Woah oh oh oh oh oh...

1056
01:04:14,529 --> 01:04:19,029
孤独を分け合い食べた
We shared and ate our loneliness

1057
01:04:19,529 --> 01:04:23,529
あの日を忘れない
I won't forget that day

1058
01:04:23,529 --> 01:04:24,529
嗚呼
Ah

1059
01:04:24,529 --> 01:04:27,029
夜を睨んだ stray dogs
The stray dogs that glared at the night

1060
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:29,529
そうだ怪物は世界のほうさ
That's right, the monster is the world itself

1061
01:04:29,629 --> 01:04:30,829
抜け出せるのかい
Can you break out?

1062
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:32,029
足は動くかい
Can your legs move?

1063
01:04:32,029 --> 01:04:34,329
走るなら今
If you're going to run, it's now

1064
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:35,329
DEMON'S RESIDENCE

1065
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:36,829
stray dogs 僕ら
We stray dogs

1066
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:39,629
この街を駆け抜けていけ
Let's run through this city

1067
01:04:39,629 --> 01:04:41,529
地獄の果てに
At the end of hell

1068
01:04:41,529 --> 01:04:42,729
何が見えるかい
What can you see?

1069

この街は檻のようで
This city is like a cage

1073
01:04:49,529 --> 01:04:50,729

How about you?

1074
01:04:50,729 --> 01:04:52,329
共に駆けるかい？
Will you run together?

1075
01:04:52,329 --> 01:04:54,829
夜明けが合図だ
Dawn is the signal

1076
01:04:54,929 --> 01:05:00,529
行こう

1092
01:05:48,964 --> 01:06:01,584
Lyrics: Kris Roche / Music: Alobahn (-81), Kris Roche / Arrangement: Alobahn (-81)

1093
01:05:52,101 --> 01:05:56,184
Bau bau! Thank you for always being here for FuwaMoco!

1094
01:05:56,269 --> 01:05:58,684
Please listen to:

1095
01:05:58,772 --> 01:06:01,584
side by side!

1096
01:06:04,784 --> 01:06:12,084
Finally we made it through but not without some tears

1097
01:06:12,184 --> 01:06:19,584
With the help of friends so true we faced all of our fears

1098
01:06:19,784 --> 01:06:26,584
Now we're here to celebrate all that we have done

1099
01:06:26,784 --> 01:06:31,084
I can feel it's more than just a game of fate

1100
01:06:31,184 --> 01:06:34,784
'cause our stories have just begun

1101
01:06:34,984 --> 01:06:38,584
Hand in hand we're not waiting on tomorrow

1102
01:06:38,784 --> 01:06:42,584
From now on its the heart that we will follow

1103
01:06:42,784 --> 01:06:50,084
We'll move on passed the heartbreak and the sorrow If you stay by my side

1104
01:06:50,584 --> 01:06:54,084
Dancing harmonics feeling the music

1105
01:06:54,184 --> 01:06:57,784
as we come alive, and sparks ignite

1106
01:06:57,984 --> 01:07:01,784
We're making memories everyday underneath

1107
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:05,584
the summer sky and through the night

1108
01:07:05,784 --> 01:07:09,384
We're singing melodies every time we hear music

1109
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:13,384
from inside as hearts collide

1110
01:07:13,584 --> 01:07:17,084
Bringing out the best in each other now

1111
01:07:17,184 --> 01:07:21,384
we're feeling free like were meant to be

1112
01:07:21,684 --> 01:07:25,584
Even though there's been rough times when nobody wanted us,

1113
01:07:25,684 --> 01:07:28,584
we kept going and we kept dreaming!

1114
01:07:28,684 --> 01:07:31,384
Now we're here, we're not alone anymore!

1115
01:07:31,484 --> 01:07:33,784
We'll be here together, with a smile to protect!

1116
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:36,084
Come on, let's go!

1117
01:07:36,184 --> 01:07:39,784
Dancing harmonics feeling the music

1118
01:07:39,884 --> 01:07:43,384
as we come alive, and sparks ignite

1119
01:07:43,584 --> 01:07:47,384
We're making memories everyday underneath

1120
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:51,384
the summer sky and through the night

1121
01:07:51,584 --> 01:07:55,184
We're singing melodies every time we hear music

1122
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:59,184
from inside as hearts collide

1123
01:07:59,384 --> 01:08:02,884
Bringing out the best in each other now

1124
01:08:02,984 --> 01:08:07,084
we're feeling free like were meant to be

1125
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:38,584
Nya nya nya nya nya nya nya...

1126
01:08:39,339 --> 01:08:41,384
Bau bau!

1127
01:08:45,784 --> 01:08:48,784
Thank you for the encore, Ruffians!

1128
01:08:48,884 --> 01:08:52,884
That was: side by side! Bau bau!

1129
01:08:53,084 --> 01:08:57,384
We're really happy we could perform side by side for the first time live today!

1130
01:08:57,484 --> 01:09:00,384
Yeah! 初披露できてとっても嬉しいです！
Yeah! We're so happy to perform it for the first time!

1131
01:09:00,484 --> 01:09:04,584
Side by side is a song made by Alobahn-san, but also between FuwaMoco!

1132
01:09:05,784 --> 01:09:10,084
Yeah, it's ours! We know it's a song that you love a lot,

1133
01:09:10,184 --> 01:09:14,784
but we also do because it's very special to us

1134
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:20,084
since it's the ending theme for a visual novel that we care about!

1135
01:09:20,184 --> 01:09:23,584
NEKOPARA!

1136
01:09:24,584 --> 01:09:31,084
And with this song, our dream of seeing the opening or ending theme for a visual novel came true!

1137
01:09:32,584 --> 01:09:39,084
Yeah! そう、この曲でFUWAMOCOの夢、美少女ゲームの主題歌を歌うことが叶いました！
Yeah! That's right, with this song, FUWAMOCO's dream of singing a theme song for a bishoujo game came true!

1138
01:09:39,184 --> 01:09:43,084
Our dream came true! Thank you! ありがとう！
Our dream came true! Thank you! Thank you!

1139
01:09:43,884 --> 01:09:48,384
And thank you so much for joining us for our special day again this year!

1140
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:51,584
It's been a dream with you!

1141
01:09:51,684 --> 01:09:56,784
And you know, it's all because of you that we're able to be here

1142
01:09:56,884 --> 01:10:00,084
and do all the amazing things that we do, so thank you!

1143
01:10:01,532 --> 01:10:04,099
Ah, this next song is our last song.

1144
01:10:04,932 --> 01:10:08,432
But, like, overall, it's a very special one.

1145
01:10:09,732 --> 01:10:12,132
You know, FUWAMOCO is Demon Guard Dogs.

1146
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:14,999
We're here to protect your smile, right?

1147
01:10:15,332 --> 01:10:17,199
We'll continue to do that.

1148
01:10:17,399 --> 01:10:20,299
Protect your smile. Yeah, do our best, idol!

1149
01:10:20,432 --> 01:10:24,199
And just as our fluffy and fuzzy selves, too.

1150
01:10:24,932 --> 01:10:29,399
We'll continue to be here for thousands and thousands of demon dog years.

1151
01:10:29,965 --> 01:10:33,799
Always remembering that, you know, every day isn't given.

1152
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:36,799
Yeah, we don't take anything for granted.

1153
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:40,932
And you know, when you're down, we hope that you'll remember...

1154
01:10:41,365 --> 01:10:43,999
...that we're always here cheering you on, okay?

1155
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:45,999
We'll cheer you on Ruffians!

1156
01:10:46,332 --> 01:10:49,799
So please listen closely to the lyrics of our last song for today.

1157
01:11:05,132 --> 01:11:06,832
明日も
Tomorrow

1158
01:11:07,099 --> 01:11:08,732
明後日も
The day after tomorrow

1159
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:12,799
あなたが笑ってますように
I hope you'll be smiling

1160
01:11:12,932 --> 01:11:14,399
ずっと
Always

1161
01:11:14,565 --> 01:11:17,232
Lala...

1162
01:11:19,032 --> 01:11:22,932
Thank you so much Ruffians for spending our birthday with us today!

1163
01:11:23,465 --> 01:11:26,832
Please think of this song whenever things are rough and know Double B is here.

1164
01:11:27,532 --> 01:11:30,999
This last song is for you. Wishful Garnet!

1165
01:11:32,932 --> 01:11:35,999
過去を振り返ると
When I look back

1166
01:11:36,165 --> 01:11:38,832
思い出す ガーネットの空
I remember the garnet sky

1167
01:11:41,332 --> 01:11:44,299
あふれてく 光
Overflowing light

1168
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:49,999
この瞳に映し出されたあの日は
That day reflected in these eyes

1169
01:11:51,032 --> 01:11:55,599
美しく 揺れる
Beautifully swaying

1170
01:11:56,332 --> 01:11:57,532
What do you think?

1171
01:11:58,232 --> 01:12:01,632
紅く 滲んだ空に
In the crimson-stained sky

1172
01:12:02,332 --> 01:12:04,332
願いました
I made a wish

1173
01:12:04,532 --> 01:12:07,532
どうかこの願い
Please let this wish

1174
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:10,632
届けてください
Reach you

1175
01:12:11,532 --> 01:12:13,299
明日も
Tomorrow

1176
01:12:13,465 --> 01:12:14,999
明後日も
The day after tomorrow

1177
01:12:15,165 --> 01:12:19,099
あなたが笑ってますように
I hope you'll be smiling

1178
01:12:19,299 --> 01:12:22,999
離れ離れになっても
Even if we're apart

1179
01:12:23,132 --> 01:12:26,899
前を向けますように
I hope you can look forward

1180
01:12:27,099 --> 01:12:30,099
あなたを縛る鎖を
The chains that bind you

1181
01:12:30,299 --> 01:12:33,399
わたしが壊してあげる もう
I'll break them for you, no more

1182
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:36,632
負けないで 進むこと
Don't lose, keep moving forward

1183
01:12:36,832 --> 01:12:40,132
いつでもそばにいるから
Because I'm always by your side

1184
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:53,399
落ち込んだり
Being depressed

1185
01:12:53,565 --> 01:12:56,799
自信を無くした時だって
Or even when you lose confidence

1186
01:12:57,732 --> 01:13:00,799
目の前にいてくれる
You are there in front of my eyes

1187
01:13:01,732 --> 01:13:05,099
あなたの笑顔に 何度となく
To your smile, countless times

1188
01:13:05,265 --> 01:13:08,199
救われた
I was saved

1189
01:13:10,132 --> 01:13:11,699
だから
That's why

1190
01:13:12,799 --> 01:13:14,199
So I love you

1191
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:18,332
挫けそうになったら 手を伸ばして
If you're about to give up, reach out your hand

1192
01:13:19,632 --> 01:13:23,332
まだ知らない 明日
To the tomorrow we don't know yet

1193
01:13:24,699 --> 01:13:27,132
一緒に見つけよう
Let's find it together

1194
01:13:28,099 --> 01:13:29,799
明日も
Tomorrow

1195
01:13:29,965 --> 01:13:31,399
明後日も
The day after tomorrow

1196
01:13:31,565 --> 01:13:35,532
あなたを照らしていたい
I want to keep shining on you

1197
01:13:35,699 --> 01:13:38,999
泣きそうになった時は
When you're about to cry

1198
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:42,432
こっち向いてほしい
I want you to look this way

1199
01:13:42,632 --> 01:13:46,399
世界でひとりぼっち
Alone in the world

1200
01:13:46,565 --> 01:13:49,832
そんな風に思わないで
Don't think like that

1201
01:13:50,432 --> 01:13:53,232
愛してくれる人はきっと
People who love you surely...

1202
01:13:54,099 --> 01:13:57,299
いつもあなたを想ってる
...are always thinking of you

1203
01:14:04,332 --> 01:14:06,399
Wishful Garnet!

1204
01:14:19,399 --> 01:14:24,999
Lala...

1205
01:14:26,099 --> 01:14:28,132

明後日も
The day after tomorrow

1210
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:43,099
あなたが笑ってますように
I hope you'll be smiling

1211
01:14:43,299 --> 01:14:46,999
離れ離れになっても
Even if we're apart

1212
01:14:47,132 --> 01:14:50,832
前を向けますように
I hope you can look forward

1213
01:14:51,032 --> 01:14:54,099
あなたを縛る鎖を
The chains that bind you

1214
01:14:54,299 --> 01:14:57,132
わたしが壊してあげる もう
I'll break them for you, no more

1215
01:14:57,432 --> 01:15:00,299
負けないで 進むこと
Don't lose, keep moving forward

1216
01:15:00,499 --> 01:15:02,299
輝く空へ
To the shining sky

明日も

1218
01:15:04,165 --> 01:15:06,370
明後日も あなたが笑ってますように
The day after tomorrow, I hope you'll be smiling

1219
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:09,380
離れ離れになっても
Even if we are far apart,

1220
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:12,700
前を向けますように
I hope we can keep looking forward

1221
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,940
あなたを縛る鎖を
The chains that bind you,

1222
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:19,140
わたしが壊してあげる wo-oh
I will break them for you, wo-oh

1223
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:24,220
もう負けないで進むこと
Never lose again, and keep moving forward

1224
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:27,100
いつでもそばに
Always by your side,

1225
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:30,180
あなたのそばに
By your side,

1226
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:35,460
わたしはいつもいるから
Because I'll always be here

1227
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:40,740
La la la...

1228
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:45,300
Yeah! Yeah!

1229
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:50,140
Yeah! Yeah!

1230
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:56,020
Wo-oh... La la la...

1231
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:12,620
