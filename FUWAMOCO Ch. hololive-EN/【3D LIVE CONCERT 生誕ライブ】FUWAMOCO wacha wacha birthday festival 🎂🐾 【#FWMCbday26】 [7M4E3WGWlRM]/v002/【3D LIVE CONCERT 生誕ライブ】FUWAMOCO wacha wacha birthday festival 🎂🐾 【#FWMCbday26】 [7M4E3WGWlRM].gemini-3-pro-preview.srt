242
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:35,029
I think we need a special guest with us, right?

243
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:35,729
Yeah!

244
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:38,429
Okay, let's call her on together.

245
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,229

00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:57,229
Shinigami dog.

252
00:10:57,229 --> 00:10:58,229
Yeah!

253
00:10:58,229 --> 00:10:59,429
Thank you for coming to our birthday!

00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:03,229
Thank you for inviting me! I'm happy to be here!

255
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,029
What's up, Ruffians?

256
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:08,429
But I see you have a pretty nice shirt there, huh?

257
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:11,729
I do. Wow, look at this logo.

258
00:11:11,729 --> 00:11:12,729
What could it say?

259
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:14,229
Check it out. Respect.

260
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:16,229

261
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:17,429
With respect.

262
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:23,029
But you know, it might be cute if we matched, right?

263
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:23,729
Right!

264
00:11:25,229 --> 00:11:27,229
Ah, well... maybe we'll just go run...

265
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,429
...and we'll get changed.

266
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:30,729
Entertain them with the 'Bau Bau's for a second.

267
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:31,729
Okay, I got this.

268
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:32,729
No problem.

269
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:34,029
They won't bite... maybe.

270
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:34,729
Yeah, okay.

271
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:35,729
Bau bau!

272
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,229
Ruffians!

273
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:41,229

できないかも… できない！
I might not be able to... I can't!

276
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:47,229
I can't... I'm sorry, I can't.

277
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:48,429
I can't do it!

278
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:49,729
I did my best.

279
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:50,729
Did we change?

280
00:11:50,729 --> 00:11:51,729
We changed, right?

281
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:52,729
Yes! See?

282
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:54,229
I can't even bend.

283
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:56,729
But now... we're matching!

284
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:57,729
Matching!

285
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:59,029
Twinning!

286
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:00,729
Tripleting?

287
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:01,729
Tripleting!

288
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:03,229
Ah, that has a nice ring to it.

289
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:06,729
And this next song...

290
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:08,229
is one that FUWAMOCO...

291
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:10,729
We wanted to sing with you for such a long time!

292
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,729
Yes!

293
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:15,429
Something nostalgic... and I think you'll be able to see why.

294
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:17,429
There's some rap... as well.

295
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:21,029
But it's also very cute, right?

296
00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:27,229
次歌う曲は、Calli先輩と一緒にずっと歌いたかった大好きな曲ですね！
This next song is one we've wanted to sing with Calli-senpai for a long time; it's our favorite!

297
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:28,029
そうですね！
That's right!

298
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:30,729
It's both cute... it's cool...

299
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:34,029
But, I think, you know, it shares an important part that...

300
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:36,729
You know, you should be proud of what you like, right?

301
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:40,729
Important meaning of being proud... being strong about what you like, yeah!

302
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:41,729
Yeah, your likes!

303
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,029
You know, whether that be games...

304
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,729
Or anime...

305
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:48,029
Or idols!

306
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:49,229
Figures!

307
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:51,729
Or maybe even... VTubers?

308
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,729
Yeah!

309
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:55,729
You know, after all, life is more fun when...

310
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:57,229
...you're just true to yourself.

311
00:12:57,229 --> 00:12:58,229
Right?

312
00:12:58,229 --> 00:12:59,429
Definitely. I agree.

313
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:01,229
So, are you ready to sing this song for you?

314
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:02,229
Okay!

315
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:04,229

00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:38,972
YAGOO-san?

849
00:47:39,272 --> 00:47:40,672
That's a good guess maybe...

850
00:47:45,472 --> 00:47:47,472
Maybe you should get ready...

851
00:47:47,672 --> 00:47:49,972
...because, you know, they aren't quite as bad as Pero...

852
00:47:50,272 --> 00:47:52,972
...but they can get pretty nasty sometimes!

853
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:59,472
Moco-chan, you're not going to be rude to our next guest or anything... right?

854
00:47:59,972 --> 00:48:01,472
Especially before calling them out!

855
00:48:01,672 --> 00:48:03,272
We'll see!

856
00:48:04,472 --> 00:48:06,472
Well, let's get them out here then!

857
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:08,972
Who could it be?

858
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:11,972
せーの！
Ready, set!

859
00:48:12,272 --> 00:48:13,272
どうぞ！
Come on out!

860
00:48:15,472 --> 00:48:18,972

00:48:26,672 --> 00:48:27,972

初めまして！
Nice to meet you!

00:48:34,472 --> 00:48:36,972
チワワじゃないよ、FUWAWAだよ！
Not a Chihuahua, it's Fuwawa!

868
00:48:37,472 --> 00:48:39,472
FUWAWAじゃないよ、MOCOCOだよ！
Not Fuwawa, it's Mococo!

869
00:48:39,972 --> 00:48:41,972
二人合わせて...
Together we are...

870
00:48:41,972 --> 00:48:43,272
FUWAMOCOです！
FUWAMOCO!

871
00:48:44,972 --> 00:48:45,972
よろしくお願いします！
Nice to meet you!

872
00:48:48,972 --> 00:48:52,472

874
00:48:55,672 --> 00:48:56,472

875
00:48:57,972 --> 00:48:58,972
いいしんねー！
Looking good!

876
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:04,972
ちょっとね、視聴者のラフィアンズはたくさんいると思いますけど...
Um, I think there are a lot of Ruffians watching right now, but...

877
00:49:05,472 --> 00:49:08,972
...クロちゃんがどんな人なのか説明してもらえますか？
...could you explain what kind of person Kuro-chan is?

878
00:49:09,972 --> 00:49:11,972
え、自分ですんのそれ？
Eh, I have to do it myself?

879
00:49:13,472 --> 00:49:14,472
Introduction?

880
00:49:14,672 --> 00:49:15,972
わかったしんよ。
Understood shin yo.

881
00:49:16,272 --> 00:49:17,972
だってこれ海外の人も見てますもんね？
Because overseas people are watching this too, right?

882
00:49:18,472 --> 00:49:20,472
海外の全員分かる自己紹介しますからね。
I'll do an intro that everyone overseas will understand.

883
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:22,972
Nice to meet you!

884
00:49:22,972 --> 00:49:24,472
Nice to meet you!

885
00:49:24,672 --> 00:49:25,972
Chu chu chu chu...

886
00:49:25,972 --> 00:49:26,672
...Tulip!

887
00:49:29,972 --> 00:49:30,972
ちょっと困らないで！
Don't look so troubled!

888
00:49:32,972 --> 00:49:33,972
Tulip?

889
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:34,472
No no no no no!

890
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,972
ちょっとまだ分からないかもしれないから...
We might not understand yet, so...

891
00:49:38,472 --> 00:49:42,972
安田大サーカスっていうトリオを組んでる芸人さんで...
I'm a comedian in a trio called Yasuda Dai Circus...

892
00:49:43,472 --> 00:49:45,972
あと豆柴の大群のプロデューサーもやってます...
I also work as the producer for Mameshiba no Taigun...

893
00:49:46,472 --> 00:49:47,472
作詞とかもしてます...
I write lyrics too...

894
00:49:47,972 --> 00:49:48,972
クロちゃんです！
I'm Kuro-chan!

895
00:49:50,972 --> 00:49:53,472
じゃあ今回は英語でお願いします！
Okay, then in English this time please!

896
00:49:53,972 --> 00:49:54,972
僕が！？
Me?!

897
00:49:55,272 --> 00:49:56,272
自分で！？
By myself?!

898
00:49:57,472 --> 00:49:59,472
そんなこと急に言われたら...
If you tell me to do that so suddenly...

899
00:49:59,972 --> 00:50:00,972
It's shy...

900
00:50:01,272 --> 00:50:02,272
Flower...

901
00:50:06,127 --> 00:50:07,027
頑張って！
Do your best!

902
00:50:07,027 --> 00:50:08,027
ファッション！
Fashion!

903
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:09,727
えーと…なんだろ、なんだろ…
Umm... what is it, what is it...

904
00:50:09,727 --> 00:50:11,927
フェイマス・コメディアン！
Famous Comedian!

905
00:50:13,127 --> 00:50:15,427
アンド、アイドル・プロデューサー！
And, Idol Producer!

906
00:50:15,827 --> 00:50:17,127
イヤ、イヤ、クール、クール！
Yeah, yeah, cool, cool!

907
00:50:17,427 --> 00:50:18,727
やってるしんよ〜！
I'm doing it-shin yo!

908
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:20,027
できる！いい！
You can do it! Nice!

909
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,927
クロちゃん、テレビでよく見てるけど…
Kuro-chan, we see you on TV often, but...

910
00:50:24,327 --> 00:50:27,727
ちょっとフワモコのペットのペロちゃんと…
You kinda resemble FUWAMOCO's pet, Pero-chan...

911
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:30,427
えっと、ちょっと似てるところがたくさんあるね。
Umm, there are a lot of parts that look alike.

912
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:31,427
似てる！？
Look alike!?

913
00:50:31,627 --> 00:50:34,327
ちょっと後ろの飾りに見てください…見えますか？
Please look at the decoration in the back... can you see it?

914
00:50:36,427 --> 00:50:37,727
そう！それがペロですね！
Yes! That is Pero!

915
00:50:38,627 --> 00:50:41,827
ちょっと待って！球体というか丸いところが似てるだけじゃない！？
Wait a minute! Isn't it just that we're both round spheres!?

916
00:50:41,827 --> 00:50:42,927
そうじゃない？
Isn't that it?

917
00:50:42,927 --> 00:50:43,927
本当？
Really?

918
00:50:44,427 --> 00:50:47,227
えっと、クロちゃんと似てるところは…
Umm, the part that resembles Kuro-chan is...

919
00:50:47,227 --> 00:50:48,527
嘘つきで…
Being a liar...

920
00:50:48,527 --> 00:50:50,127
女の子好きで…
Liking girls...

921
00:50:50,127 --> 00:50:50,927
あら！
Oh my!

922
00:50:50,927 --> 00:50:52,027
やらしい！
So sleazy!

923
00:50:52,027 --> 00:50:54,827
だからね、見た目で騙されないで！
So, don't be deceived by appearances!

924
00:50:54,827 --> 00:50:57,627
え、クロちゃんはそんなんで大丈夫なの？言われて。
Eh, is Kuro-chan okay being told that?

925
00:50:57,627 --> 00:50:59,327
いや、酷い！悲しくなってきた！
No, that's cruel! I'm getting sad!

926
00:50:59,327 --> 00:51:00,927
エーン、エーン、エーン！
*Crying noises*

927
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:02,527
エンポー、ソエンフーン！
*Exaggerated crying gibberish*

928
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:04,427
ワオ〜ン！
Wao~n! (Howling)

929
00:51:05,027 --> 00:51:07,927
全然、人のギャグを聞かないよね、君達は！
You two really don't listen to people's jokes at all!

930
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,727
できれば…
If possible...

931
00:51:10,727 --> 00:51:15,127
クロちゃんはペロの友達になってくれませんか？
Would Kuro-chan please become Pero's friend?

932
00:51:15,127 --> 00:51:17,727
え？フワモコの友達じゃなくて、ペロの友達なんの？
Eh? Not FUWAMOCO's friend, but Pero's friend?

933
00:51:17,727 --> 00:51:21,327
そう、フワモコはクロちゃんと友達になりたくないから！
Right, because FUWAMOCO doesn't want to be Kuro-chan's friend!

934
00:51:21,927 --> 00:51:22,927
おかしくない？それ！
Isn't that weird!?

935
00:51:22,927 --> 00:51:24,927
いやいやいや、気持ち悪いから！
No no no, because you're creepy!

936
00:51:24,927 --> 00:51:28,327
気持ち悪くない！マニアにはウケる！
I'm not creepy! I'm popular with maniacs!

937
00:51:28,327 --> 00:51:29,927
いや、違う！
No, that's wrong!

938
00:51:29,927 --> 00:51:31,027
気持ち悪い、やっぱり。
Creepy, as I thought.

939
00:51:31,727 --> 00:51:32,927
でも、でも、モコちゃん…
But, but, Moco-chan...

940
00:51:32,927 --> 00:51:35,327
ちょっとやりすぎですよ、失礼です！
That's a bit too much, it's rude!

941
00:51:35,627 --> 00:51:38,927
いや、もしもペロと仲良くなって欲しいんだったら、
Well, if you really want me to get along with Pero,

942
00:51:38,927 --> 00:51:42,227
フワモコちゃん、クロちゃんに可愛らしく頼んだ方がいいんじゃない？
Fuwamoco-chan, shouldn't you ask Kuro-chan cutely?

943
00:51:42,627 --> 00:51:44,427
はぁ〜ん？NO！
Huuuh? NO!

944
00:51:44,427 --> 00:51:46,127
NO！NO！
NO! NO!

945
00:51:46,427 --> 00:51:48,327
しっかりとした否定！
A firm denial!

946
00:51:49,727 --> 00:51:53,527
けど、ペロ可愛いから仲良くなってもいいとは思ってるよ。
But, Pero is cute, so I think it's okay to get along.

947
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,927
あ、嬉しい嬉しい！
Ah, happy happy!

948
00:51:54,927 --> 00:51:59,027
可愛くないけど、なんか仲良くなってくれたら嬉しいかな。
You're not cute, but I guess I'd be happy if you got along.

949
00:51:59,327 --> 00:52:01,927
感情が…感情が色々ありすぎなのよ、本当に。
There are... way too many mixed emotions, really.

950
00:52:01,927 --> 00:52:06,127
まあまあ！クロちゃんって芸人さんだけど、
Now now! Kuro-chan, you are a comedian but...

951
00:52:06,127 --> 00:52:08,527
アイドルになりたいんですよね、ね？
You want to become an idol, right?

952
00:52:09,027 --> 00:52:14,627
そう！元々アイドルになろうと思ったのに騙されて芸人にさせられたから…
Yes! Originally I thought I'd become an idol, but I was tricked into being a comedian...

953
00:52:14,627 --> 00:52:17,427
アイドルは本当に夢！ドリーム！
Being an idol is truly my dream! Dream!

954
00:52:17,827 --> 00:52:19,927
なんか悲しいなぁ、可哀想。
That's kinda sad, poor thing.

955
00:52:19,927 --> 00:52:22,527
でもドリームって大事ですから！大事！
But dreams are important! Important!

956
00:52:23,927 --> 00:52:27,427
そう、で、まぁクロちゃんのドリームはアイドルなんだから、
So, since Kuro-chan's dream is to be an idol,

957
00:52:28,027 --> 00:52:31,927
もうせっかく！一緒に歌ってくれませんか？
Why not take this chance! Won't you sing together with us?

958
00:52:32,427 --> 00:52:34,327
あ！いいしんよ、いいしんよ！
Ah! That's good-shin yo, good-shin yo!

959
00:52:34,627 --> 00:52:35,827
OKだしんよ！
It's OK-dashin yo!

960
00:52:35,827 --> 00:52:37,727
この曲、ちょっと踊れるもんね。
This song, we can dance a bit to it.

961
00:52:37,727 --> 00:52:39,327
この曲？次の曲ね？
This song? The next song right?

962
00:52:40,127 --> 00:52:41,527
あの、ハードル上げないで。
Umm, don't raise the hurdle.

963
00:52:41,527 --> 00:52:42,727
え、大丈夫っしょ？
Eh, it'll be fine right?

964
00:52:42,727 --> 00:52:46,127
ね！アイドルのプロデュースもやってるし！
Right! You're also doing idol producing!

965
00:52:46,127 --> 00:52:47,227
そうそう！
Yeah yeah!

966
00:52:47,227 --> 00:52:48,827
実力見せてよ！
Show us your real skill!

967
00:52:48,827 --> 00:52:49,727
見せて！
Show us!

968
00:52:49,727 --> 00:52:51,927
OKだしんよ！いくしんよ、いくしんよ〜！
OK-dashin yo! Let's go-shin yo, let's go-shin yo!

969
00:52:51,927 --> 00:52:53,427
オッケー！
Okay!

970
00:52:53,827 --> 00:52:58,427
じゃあ、すっごく可愛い曲を一緒に歌いましょう！
Then, let's sing a super cute song together!

971
00:52:58,427 --> 00:53:00,127
え、何の歌？楽しみ！
Eh, what song? Looking forward to it!

972
00:53:00,127 --> 00:53:01,427
オッケー！
Okay!

973
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:05,327
じゃあ、一緒にタイトルコールしましょうね！
Then, let's do the title call together!

974
00:53:05,427 --> 00:53:06,427
ね！
Okay!

975
00:53:06,827 --> 00:53:09,427
せーの！『ちゅ、多様性。』
Ready! 'Chu, Tayousei.'

976
00:53:09,427 --> 00:53:11,027
『多様性』やんの！？
We're doing 'Tayousei'!?

977
00:53:28,827 --> 00:53:32,327
我愛你 酔いが覚めない
Wo ai ni (I love you), I won't sober up.

978
00:53:32,327 --> 00:53:35,127
Oh, I need you 恋が醒めない
Oh, I need you, love won't wake up.

979
00:53:35,127 --> 00:53:40,727
お生憎様の慣れ果て察して
Guess the unfortunate outcome.

980
00:53:41,627 --> 00:53:44,427
無問題 破裂してみて
Mou mantai (No problem), try bursting.

981
00:53:44,427 --> 00:53:47,427
Hold me tight トラウマの味
Hold me tight, the taste of trauma.

982
00:53:47,427 --> 00:53:52,727
猛反対 お手お座りでハイ♡報酬
Strong objection, 'Paw', 'Sit', Yes♡ Reward.

983
00:53:53,227 --> 00:53:56,327
喉の奥がチクンチクン
The back of my throat prickles.

984
00:53:57,227 --> 00:53:59,627
僕はドクンドクン
My heart goes thump-thump.

985
00:54:00,127 --> 00:54:05,327
鼓動で孤独消してみせてよ
Erase the loneliness with your heartbeat.

986
00:54:06,127 --> 00:54:09,327
愛も恋も独裁して
Dictate both love and romance.

987
00:54:09,827 --> 00:54:12,427
僕を独占して
Monopolize me.

988
00:54:12,827 --> 00:54:18,027
このまま中毒になるまでチューしよう
Let's kiss until we become addicted like this.

989
00:54:18,727 --> 00:54:21,727
Get get get on! Get get get on! Get on chu!

990
00:54:21,727 --> 00:54:24,927
Get get get on! Get get get on! Get on chu!

991
00:54:24,927 --> 00:54:28,127
熱く、とろけるくらいに溢れた気持ちが
These overflowing feelings, hot enough to melt,

992
00:54:29,627 --> 00:54:31,727
たまらないでしょ
Are unbearable, right?

993
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:34,727
Get get get on! Get get get on! Get on chu!

994
00:54:34,727 --> 00:54:37,927
Get get get on! Get get get on! Get on chu!

995
00:54:37,927 --> 00:54:41,027
我愛你 無問題
Wo ai ni (I love you), Mou mantai (No problem).

996
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,927
Get get get on chu!

997
00:54:44,227 --> 00:54:47,227
ポン・チー・カン 勝負はいつも
Pong, Chi, Kang, the match is always...

998
00:54:47,227 --> 00:54:50,227
トンチンカン 僕に言わせりゃ
Incoherent, if you ask me.

999
00:54:50,227 --> 00:54:53,227
ちんぷんかんぷんだ 最後はロンでしょ？
It's all gibberish, the end is 'Ron' right?

1000
00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:59,827
もう何回？ヤラれればいい
How many times? Should I be beaten?

1001
00:54:59,827 --> 00:55:01,927
Oh, One night 忘れられない
Oh, One night, I can't forget.

1002
00:55:02,748 --> 00:55:04,848
終わんない トキメキ 偏愛 予習
Never-ending heart-throbbing partiality preparation.

1003
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:06,948
トキメキ変愛
Heart-throbbing strange love.

1004
00:55:07,148 --> 00:55:07,898
よし！
Alright!

1005
00:55:08,848 --> 00:55:11,248
喉の奥がチクンチクン
The back of my throat prickles.

1006
00:55:11,848 --> 00:55:14,198
僕はドクンドクン
My heart goes thump-thump.

1007
00:55:15,048 --> 00:55:19,748
心臓ごと引きずり出してみせてよ
Drag out my whole heart and show it to me.

1008
00:55:21,748 --> 00:55:24,748
気持ちいいね 面倒くさいけど
It feels good, even though it's troublesome.

1009
00:55:24,748 --> 00:55:27,248
やっぱ照れくさいけど
It's embarrassing after all, but...

1010
00:55:27,848 --> 00:55:32,948
死ぬまで忘れられないチューしよ
Let's share a kiss we won't forget until we die.

1011
00:55:34,148 --> 00:55:36,948
イカれた街はゾンビで溢れる
The crazy city is overflowing with zombies.

1012
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:40,048
君は僕に恋して
You fall in love with me.

1013
00:55:40,848 --> 00:55:45,748
ドクメク胸に繋がるロープを引きなよ
Pull the rope connected to my throbbing chest.

1014
00:55:46,748 --> 00:55:49,748
Bet bet bet on... Bet on chu!

1015
00:55:49,748 --> 00:55:52,348
Bet bet bet on... Bet on chu!

1016
00:55:52,848 --> 00:55:57,948
本気で狂えちゃうくらいの鬱々しさが
The gloominess that could seriously drive me crazy...

1017
00:55:57,948 --> 00:55:59,248
美しいでしょ
Is beautiful, isn't it?

1018
00:55:59,748 --> 00:56:02,248
Get get get on... Get on chu!

1019
00:56:02,248 --> 00:56:04,848
Get get get on... Get on chu!

1020
00:56:04,848 --> 00:56:05,748
せーの！
One, two!

1021
00:56:05,748 --> 00:56:08,048
ポン・チー・カン 終わんない
Pon-Chi-Kan, it never ends.

1022
00:56:08,748 --> 00:56:11,148
Get get get on chu!

1023
00:56:11,848 --> 00:56:14,248
我愛你 無問題
I love you, no problem.

1024
00:56:14,748 --> 00:56:17,748
Get get get on chu!

1025
00:56:24,248 --> 00:56:25,748
わー！やったー！
Wow! We did it!

えっと... さよならする前に...
Um... before we say goodbye...

1033
00:56:39,748 --> 00:56:40,348
え、なに？
Eh, what?

1034
00:56:40,948 --> 00:56:43,148
一個お願いしてもいいですか？
Can I ask for one favor?

1035
00:56:43,248 --> 00:56:44,848
一個だけだしんよ
Just one thing, shin.

1036
00:56:45,248 --> 00:56:46,248
一個だけじゃあ...
Just one thing, then...

1037
00:56:46,948 --> 00:56:50,048
えっと... FUWAMOCOは魔界の番犬で...
Um... FUWAMOCO are Demon Guard Dogs...

1038
00:56:50,748 --> 00:56:52,748
バウバウをよく言ってるんですけど
and we often say 'Bau Bau'...

1039
00:56:53,948 --> 00:56:55,748
クロちゃん、カメラに向かって
Kuro-chan, facing the camera...

1040
00:56:55,948 --> 00:56:57,948
FUWAMOCOのように可愛い...
Just like FUWAMOCO, a cute...

1041
00:56:57,948 --> 00:56:59,748
バウバウをしてもらえますか？
...'Bau Bau', could you do it?

1042
00:57:00,248 --> 00:57:01,748

Is that your best?

1046
00:57:10,848 --> 00:57:12,048

One more time!

1047
00:57:12,148 --> 00:57:13,248

実はもう一個やりたいことがあるんですけど
Actually, there is one more thing I want to do.

00:57:24,848 --> 00:57:26,748
先ほどやりましたけど
We did it earlier, but...

1054
00:57:26,748 --> 00:57:29,248
FUWAMOCOはいつもやってる自己紹介があって
FUWAMOCO has a self-introduction we always do.

1055
00:57:30,248 --> 00:57:32,248
できれば三人で一緒にやりたいです！
If possible, I want to do it with all three of us!

1056
00:57:32,748 --> 00:57:33,748
あ、あれ可愛かったから
Ah, that was cute so...

1057
00:57:33,748 --> 00:57:35,148
やりたい、クロちゃんも！
I want to do it too, Kuro-chan does!

1058
00:57:36,148 --> 00:57:37,248
じゃあ行きますよー！
Then here we go!

1059
00:57:37,748 --> 00:57:38,748
オッケー！
Okay!

00:57:39,248 --> 00:57:40,948
ふわふわじゃないよ
Not fluffy fluffy (Fuwafuwa)...

1061

フワワだよ！
It's Fuwawa!

1062
00:57:42,248 --> 00:57:43,248
わわわわー！
Wa wa wa wa!

1063
00:57:43,248 --> 00:57:44,248

00:57:44,248 --> 00:57:45,248
クロちゃんだよ！
It's Kuro-chan!

1065
00:57:45,748 --> 00:57:46,948
ええ！？
Ehh!?

1066
00:57:46,948 --> 00:57:48,048
クロちゃんじゃないよ！
Not Kuro-chan!

1067
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,148
モココだよ！
It's Mococo!

1068
00:57:49,148 --> 00:57:50,048
三人に合わせて！
Align with the three of us!

1069
00:57:50,148 --> 00:57:51,048
合わせて！
Align it!

1070
00:57:51,048 --> 00:57:52,748
いやいやいや！
No no no no!

1071
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:54,248
怒んないで！どうしたの？
Don't get mad! What's wrong?

1072
00:57:54,748 --> 00:57:55,748
出てけクロちゃん！
Get out, Kuro-chan!

1073
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:56,948
出てかないから！
I'm not leaving!

00:57:56,948 --> 00:57:57,948
なんなのそれ！
What is that!

1075
00:57:59,748 --> 00:58:01,748
もう嘘とかつくのやめようね
Let's stop telling lies already.

1076
00:58:01,748 --> 00:58:02,748
やらないと！
I have to do it!

1077

モココパーンチしちゃうよ！
I'm gonna Mococo Punch you!

1078
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:08,248
痛ーい！
Ouuuch!

1079
00:58:09,748 --> 00:58:11,248
救急車一台！
One ambulance!

1080
00:58:12,048 --> 00:58:13,248
いらないよ！
We don't need it!

1081
00:58:13,248 --> 00:58:14,748
もう嘘！
Another lie!

1082
00:58:14,848 --> 00:58:15,848
いらないって何それ！
What do you mean we don't need it!

1083
00:58:15,948 --> 00:58:17,748
プンプン！
Hmph hmph! (Angry SFX)

1084
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:19,148
なんてプンプン怒んのちょっと！
Why are you getting so angry!

1085
00:58:19,148 --> 00:58:20,748
落ち着いて、落ち着いて！
Calm down, calm down!

1086
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:21,748
なんで？
Why?

1087
00:58:22,148 --> 00:58:24,048
大丈夫、モコちゃん大丈夫！
It's okay, Moco-chan, it's okay!

1088
00:58:24,748 --> 00:58:26,248
クロちゃんはこれからも...
Kuro-chan, from now on...

1089
00:58:26,748 --> 00:58:28,248
みんなをいっぱい笑顔にして
...make everyone smile a lot...

1090
00:58:28,748 --> 00:58:30,748
素敵なアイドルになってくださいね！
...and please become a wonderful idol!

1091
00:58:30,948 --> 00:58:31,948

Leave it to me, shin!

1092
00:58:32,248 --> 00:58:33,748

最後にクロちゃんにハイタッチしてお別れしようね
Let's high-five Kuro-chan and say goodbye.

1096
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:39,748
おっけー！
Okay!

1097
00:58:39,748 --> 00:58:40,948
仲直り仲直り、いい？
Reconciliation, reconciliation, okay?

1098
00:58:41,048 --> 00:58:41,948
仲直りね！
Reconciliation, right!

1099
00:58:42,748 --> 00:58:43,748
いくしんよ！
Here I go, shin!

1100
00:58:43,748 --> 00:58:45,248
ハイタッチ！ハイタッチ！
High five! High five!

1101
00:58:45,748 --> 00:58:46,948

へへーん！
Heheee!

1108
00:58:56,148 --> 00:58:57,148
ひどくない？
Isn't that mean?

1109
00:58:57,148 --> 00:58:58,048
もうちょっと！
Geez!

1110
00:58:58,148 --> 00:58:58,948
なんなの？
What is it?

1111
00:58:58,948 --> 00:58:59,348
けど！
But!

1112
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:02,748
FUWAMOCOちゃん、本当にお誕生日おめでとうございます！
FUWAMOCO-chan, really, Happy Birthday!

1113
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:05,048

1118
00:59:13,148 --> 00:59:14,748
Let's stay going!
Let's keep going!

1119
00:59:19,748 --> 00:59:21,748
Fireworks!

1120
00:59:21,748 --> 00:59:24,748
Look at the beautiful fireworks! Yeah!

1121
00:59:24,748 --> 00:59:26,248
Tamaya~!

1122
00:59:26,248 --> 00:59:27,748
Kagiya~!

1123
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:29,748
Bau Bau!

1124
00:59:29,748 --> 00:59:31,748
Wow!

1125
00:59:31,748 --> 00:59:33,048
That was so fun!

1126
00:59:33,248 --> 00:59:36,748
Things kind of got really crazy there...

1127
00:59:36,748 --> 00:59:38,048
I'm not too sure what happened...

1128
00:59:38,048 --> 00:59:40,948
なんか色々すごすぎて分からなくなってきたかも
It was all so amazing, I might be getting confused.

1129
00:59:40,948 --> 00:59:43,748
But we still have one more thing!

1130
00:59:43,948 --> 00:59:46,948
One more very exciting thing to share with you all!

1131
00:59:46,948 --> 00:59:48,748
まだまだ楽しみがあるよ！
There's still more fun to come!

1132
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:54,748
Maybe... Ruffians... can you guess what it is?

1133
00:59:54,848 --> 00:59:56,148
何かな？何かな？
What is it? What is it?

1134
00:59:57,748 --> 00:59:59,748
Well... Fuwamoco...

1135
00:59:59,748 --> 01:00:01,748
On our first anniversary...

1136
01:00:01,529 --> 01:00:05,479
Going to be fun!

1137
01:00:06,429 --> 01:00:08,379
And then for our second anniversary...

1138
01:00:08,429 --> 01:00:10,679
we were able to release "Lifetime Showtime"!

1139
01:00:11,029 --> 01:00:14,629
Our original song that's grown with us along this journey.

1140
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:17,029
A very special song.

1141
01:00:17,729 --> 01:00:23,029
And you know, for Fuwawa and Mococo, singing and dancing is something that means so much to us.

1142
01:00:25,029 --> 01:00:25,929
And Ruffians...

1143
01:00:26,329 --> 01:00:29,529
might have heard that you'd like to hear more from us too.

1144
01:00:29,629 --> 01:00:30,329
Right?

1145
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:33,029
What do you think?

1146
01:00:34,029 --> 01:00:34,729
Well...

1147
01:00:36,029 --> 01:00:37,729
The announcement is...

1148
01:00:38,029 --> 01:00:38,729
Drumroll!

1149
01:00:46,329 --> 01:00:46,829
Dan!
Bam!

1150
01:00:48,029 --> 01:00:50,029
A new original song!

1151
01:00:54,529 --> 01:00:57,729
And this song is extra special.

1152
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:02,329
It's written by none other than the legendary rock idol song composer...

1153
01:01:02,529 --> 01:01:03,829
Matsukuma Kenta-san!

1154
01:01:04,029 --> 01:01:07,029
Who works with many famous idol groups that we love.

1155
01:01:07,529 --> 01:01:12,329
Also written music for the idol group that Kuro-chan produces, Mameshiba no Taigun-san!

1156
01:01:14,329 --> 01:01:18,329
But Ruffians, you might be a little bit surprised, okay?

1157
01:01:18,529 --> 01:01:19,729
So get ready.

1158
01:01:20,529 --> 01:01:21,329
Ruffians...

1159
01:01:21,529 --> 01:01:22,629
With this song...

1160
01:01:22,729 --> 01:01:27,029
we'd like to express our rawest feelings as demon dogs.

1161
01:01:30,029 --> 01:01:32,329
Demon's Residence

1162
01:01:56,729 --> 01:01:58,629
「相棒、どこへ行こうか」
"Partner, where shall we go?"

1163
01:01:59,029 --> 01:02:00,729
ネオンの脇を抜け
Slip past the neon lights.

1164
01:02:01,329 --> 01:02:04,729
バブルガムがはじけたら let's go
When the bubblegum pops, let's go.

1165
01:02:07,029 --> 01:02:08,929
最低な夜を潜って
Diving under the worst kind of night,

1166
01:02:09,129 --> 01:02:11,029
僕らは群れをなす
We form a pack.

1167
01:02:11,529 --> 01:02:15,029
「あの頃よりもマシだね」 my way
"It's better than back then," my way.

1168
01:02:17,029 --> 01:02:19,029
「不完全なんです」
"I am imperfect."

1169
01:02:19,129 --> 01:02:22,029
首輪をつけた
Wearing a collar,

1170
01:02:22,329 --> 01:02:25,529
良い子なんかじゃもうイヤ Ah!!
I don't wanna be a "good girl" anymore, Ah!!

1171
01:02:27,329 --> 01:02:29,029
DEMON'S RESIDENCE

1172
01:02:29,029 --> 01:02:30,029
噛みついていけ
Bite into it.

1173
01:02:30,029 --> 01:02:32,329
この街は檻のようで
This city is like a cage.

1174
01:02:32,529 --> 01:02:33,529
気分はどうだい
How does it feel?

1175
01:02:33,729 --> 01:02:34,729
泣いているのかい
Are you crying?

1176
01:02:34,929 --> 01:02:38,529
鎖をちぎって叫んでいたいんだ
I want to tear off these chains and scream.

1177
01:02:38,729 --> 01:02:39,729
stray dogs

1178
01:02:39,929 --> 01:02:42,329
遥か彼方へと飛ぶ鳥を
The birds flying far away into the distance,

1179
01:02:42,729 --> 01:02:43,629
見上げるだけかい
Are you just going to look up at them?

1180
01:02:43,729 --> 01:02:44,829
それでいいのかい
Is that enough for you?

1181
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:48,529
燃えるなら ほら青く
If you're gonna burn, then burn blue.

1182
01:02:57,829 --> 01:02:59,729
「説教なんかいらない」
"I don't need any lectures."

1183
01:03:00,029 --> 01:03:01,829
スプレー缶振って
Shake the spray can.

1184
01:03:02,329 --> 01:03:05,729
イタズラ書きで彩る runway
Color the runway with graffiti.

1185
01:03:08,029 --> 01:03:10,029
愛情なんか coin toss
Love is just a coin toss.

1186
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:12,029
誰にbetするのか
Who are you gonna bet on?

1187
01:03:12,529 --> 01:03:15,929
不確定要素ばかりね lonely
It's all just uncertain factors, lonely.

1188
01:03:18,029 --> 01:03:20,029
二人で
The two of us,

1189
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:23,029
ひとつと決めた
decided to be one.

1190
01:03:23,529 --> 01:03:27,029
あの日を忘れない Ah!!
I won't forget that day, Ah!!

1191
01:03:28,729 --> 01:03:30,529
DEMON'S RESIDENCE

1192
01:03:30,529 --> 01:03:31,529
満天の空
The sky full of stars,

1193
01:03:31,529 --> 01:03:33,529
あの星がひどく不快で
that star is terribly unpleasant.

1194
01:03:33,629 --> 01:03:34,629
勝利はどうだい
How is victory?

1195
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:35,729
味がするのかい
Does it have a taste?

1196
01:03:35,929 --> 01:03:39,529
鎖を噛んで唸っていたんだ
Biting the chains, I was growling.

1197
01:03:39,729 --> 01:03:40,729
stray dogs

1198
01:03:40,929 --> 01:03:43,529
僕ら宇宙さえも撃ち落として
We shoot down even the cosmos.

1199
01:03:43,729 --> 01:03:44,629
見下ろす奈落
The abyss looking down,

1200
01:03:44,729 --> 01:03:45,729
ビルは輝く
The buildings shine.

1201
01:03:46,029 --> 01:03:50,029
LOL Now I am free!

1202
01:04:14,729 --> 01:04:17,029
孤独を分け合い
We shared our loneliness,

1203
01:04:17,129 --> 01:04:19,529
食べた
and devoured it.

1204
01:04:20,029 --> 01:04:23,329
あの日を忘れない
I won't forget that day.

1205
01:04:23,529 --> 01:04:25,029
鳴呼
Ah...

1206
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:27,029
夜を睨んだ stray dogs そうだ
Stray dogs glaring at the night, that's right.

1207
01:04:27,329 --> 01:04:29,529
怪物は世界のほうさ
The world is the real monster.

1208
01:04:29,929 --> 01:04:30,929
抜け出せるのかい
Can you escape?

1209
01:04:31,029 --> 01:04:32,029
足は動くかい
Do your legs move?

1210
01:04:32,329 --> 01:04:34,729
走るなら今
If you're gonna run, do it now.

1211
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,529
DEMON'S RESIDENCE

1212
01:04:36,529 --> 01:04:37,529
stray dogs 僕ら
stray dogs, we are...

1213
01:04:37,529 --> 01:04:39,729
この街を駆けて行け
Run through this city.

1214
01:04:40,029 --> 01:04:40,929
地獄の果てに
At the end of hell,

1215
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:42,029
何が見えるかい
what will we see?

1216
01:04:42,329 --> 01:04:45,729
鎖をちぎって叫んでいたいんだ
I want to tear off these chains and scream.

1217
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:47,029
stray dogs 僕ら
stray dogs, we are...

1218
01:04:47,129 --> 01:04:49,529
この街は檻のようで
This city is like a cage.

1219
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:50,729
君ならどうだい
How about you?

1220
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,029
共にかけるかい
Will you run with us?

1221
01:04:52,329 --> 01:04:54,729
夜明けが合図だ
Dawn is the signal,

1222
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:56,529
行こう
let's go.

1223
01:05:16,584 --> 01:05:20,584
アンコール! アンコール!
Encore! Encore!

1224
01:05:51,684 --> 01:05:53,084
Bau bau!

1225
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:57,784
Thank you for always being here for us, Ruffians!

1226
01:05:58,084 --> 01:06:01,084
Please listen to... side by side!

1227
01:06:04,584 --> 01:06:06,984
Finally we made it through

1228
01:06:06,984 --> 01:06:10,384
but not without some tears

1229
01:06:12,584 --> 01:06:15,384
With the help of friends so true

1230
01:06:15,384 --> 01:06:18,384
we faced all of our feelings

1231
01:06:20,084 --> 01:06:23,384
Now we're here to celebrate

1232
01:06:23,384 --> 01:06:25,984
all that we have done

1233
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:30,584
I can feel it's more than just a game of fate

1234
01:06:30,584 --> 01:06:34,384
'cause our stories have just begun

1235
01:06:35,584 --> 01:06:38,984
Hand in hand we're not waiting on tomorrow

1236
01:06:38,984 --> 01:06:42,784
From now on it's the heart that we will follow

1237
01:06:42,784 --> 01:06:47,084
We'll move on past the heartbreak and the sorrow if you

1238
01:06:47,084 --> 01:06:49,584
Stay by my side

1239
01:06:50,584 --> 01:06:53,784
Dancing harmonies feeding the music

1240
01:06:53,784 --> 01:06:57,784
as we come alive, and sparks ignite

1241
01:06:58,584 --> 01:07:01,784
We're making memories everyday underneath

1242
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:05,784
the summer sky and through the night

1243
01:07:06,584 --> 01:07:09,784
We're singing melodies every time we hear music

1244
01:07:09,784 --> 01:07:13,784
from inside as hearts collide

1245
01:07:14,584 --> 01:07:17,384
Bringing out the best in each other

1246
01:07:17,384 --> 01:07:21,084
now we're feeling free like we're meant to be

1247
01:07:22,084 --> 01:07:24,084
Even though there's been rough times

1248
01:07:24,084 --> 01:07:25,784
where nobody wanted us

1249
01:07:25,784 --> 01:07:27,384
We kept going!

1250
01:07:27,384 --> 01:07:29,084
And we kept dreaming!

1251
01:07:29,084 --> 01:07:30,384
Now we're here

1252
01:07:30,384 --> 01:07:32,384
we're not alone anymore!

1253
01:07:32,384 --> 01:07:33,784
So be here together

1254
01:07:33,784 --> 01:07:35,084
with a smile to protect!

1255
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:37,084
Come on, let's go!

1256
01:07:37,084 --> 01:07:39,784
Dancing harmonies feeding the music

1257
01:07:39,784 --> 01:07:43,784
as we come alive, and sparks ignite

1258
01:07:44,584 --> 01:07:47,784
We're making memories everyday underneath

1259
01:07:47,784 --> 01:07:51,784
the summer sky and through the night

1260
01:07:52,584 --> 01:07:55,784
We're singing melodies every time we hear music

1261
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:59,784
from inside as hearts collide

1262
01:08:00,584 --> 01:08:03,384
Bringing out the best in each other

1263
01:08:03,384 --> 01:08:07,084
now we're feeling free like we're meant to be

1264
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:11,584
Nya, nya nya nya...

1265
01:08:39,384 --> 01:08:41,084
Bau bau!

1266
01:08:45,784 --> 01:08:48,084
Thank you for the encore Ruffians!

1267
01:08:48,684 --> 01:08:50,584
That was side by side!

1268
01:08:53,084 --> 01:08:58,084
We really sang side by side for you for the first time live today!

1269
01:09:00,084 --> 01:09:02,084
初披露できてとっても嬉しい！
I'm so happy we could perform it for the first time!

1270
01:09:02,584 --> 01:09:06,084
Side by side is a song made by Aiobahn-san...

1271
01:09:06,084 --> 01:09:09,084
but also featuring FUWAMOCO!

1272
01:09:11,084 --> 01:09:15,084
You know, we know it's a song that you love a lot...

1273
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:17,584
but we love it too because...

1274
01:09:17,584 --> 01:09:21,084
it's very special to us since it's the ending theme...

1275
01:09:21,084 --> 01:09:23,584
for a visual novel that we care about!

1276
01:09:23,584 --> 01:09:25,084
Nekopara!

1277
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:28,584
And with this song...

1278
01:09:28,584 --> 01:09:33,084
our dream of singing the opening or ending theme for a visual novel came true!

1279
01:09:35,584 --> 01:09:38,084
そう、この曲でフワモコの夢...
Yes, with this song, FUWAMOCO's dream...

1280
01:09:38,084 --> 01:09:42,584
美少女ゲームの主題歌を歌うことが叶いました！
of singing a bishoujo game theme song came true!

1281
01:09:45,584 --> 01:09:47,084
ありがとう！
Thank you!

1282
01:09:47,084 --> 01:09:51,084
And thank you so much for joining us for a special day again this year!

1283
01:09:52,584 --> 01:09:54,584
It's been a dream, Ruffians!

1284
01:09:55,584 --> 01:09:57,084
And you know...

1285
01:09:57,084 --> 01:10:00,084
it's all because of you that we're able to be here...

1286
01:10:00,084 --> 01:10:02,584
and do all the amazing things that we do, so...

1287
01:10:02,584 --> 01:10:04,084
Thank you!

1288
01:10:04,415 --> 01:10:06,065
Ah... Right...

1289
01:10:06,065 --> 01:10:09,465
But... like, above all... it's a very special one.

1290
01:10:10,065 --> 01:10:11,465
You know, FuwaMoco...

1291
01:10:11,465 --> 01:10:13,765
...as Demon Guard Dogs...

1292
01:10:13,765 --> 01:10:16,465
...we're here to protect your smile, right?

1293
01:10:16,465 --> 01:10:17,765
We'll continue to do that!

1294
01:10:17,765 --> 01:10:19,365
Protect your smile!

1295
01:10:19,365 --> 01:10:20,765
Yeah! Do our all as idols!

1296
01:10:20,765 --> 01:10:24,165
And satisfy our fluffy and fuzzy souls too!

1297
01:10:24,165 --> 01:10:25,465
Yeah!

1298
01:10:25,965 --> 01:10:30,465
We'll continue to be here for thousands and thousands of Demon Dog years!

1299
01:10:30,465 --> 01:10:34,765
And we'll remember that, you know... every day isn't given.

1300
01:10:34,765 --> 01:10:37,365
We don't take anything for granted.

1301
01:10:38,065 --> 01:10:40,465
And you know, when you're down,

1302
01:10:40,465 --> 01:10:44,065
we hope that you'll remember that we're always here cheering you on, okay?

1303
01:10:44,065 --> 01:10:46,265
We'll cheer you on always!

1304
01:10:46,265 --> 01:10:50,765
So please listen closely to the lyrics of our last song for today.

1305
01:11:05,865 --> 01:11:07,865
明日も明後日も
Tomorrow, and the day after too,

1306
01:11:07,865 --> 01:11:13,665
あなたが笑ってますように ずっと
I hope you are smiling, forever.

1307
01:11:14,465 --> 01:11:17,765
lala...

1308
01:11:19,465 --> 01:11:22,465
Thank you so much Ruffians for spending our birthday with us today!

1309
01:11:22,465 --> 01:11:24,865
Please think of this song whenever things are rough,

1310
01:11:24,865 --> 01:11:26,465
and know that we'll be here!

1311
01:11:27,465 --> 01:11:29,365
This last song is for you!

1312
01:11:29,365 --> 01:11:31,465
Wishful Garnet!

1313
01:11:33,365 --> 01:11:37,765
過去を振り返ると思い出す
When I look back at the past, I remember

1314
01:11:37,765 --> 01:11:40,865
茜色の空
The madder red sky,

1315
01:11:40,865 --> 01:11:45,165
溢れてく光
and the overflowing light.

1316
01:11:45,165 --> 01:11:49,765
この瞳に映し出されたあの日は
That day reflected in these eyes,

1317
01:11:49,765 --> 01:11:54,965
美しく揺れる
shimmers beautifully.

1318
01:11:56,165 --> 01:11:57,465
What do you think?

1319
01:11:57,965 --> 01:12:01,565
赤く滲んだ空に
To the red-stained sky,

1320
01:12:01,565 --> 01:12:04,165
願いました
I made a wish.

1321
01:12:04,165 --> 01:12:08,765
どうかこの願い
Please, let this wish...

1322
01:12:08,765 --> 01:12:11,465
届けてください
...be delivered.

1323
01:12:11,465 --> 01:12:13,665
明日も明後日も
Tomorrow, and the day after too,

1324
01:12:13,665 --> 01:12:16,865
あなたが笑ってますように
I hope you are smiling.

1325
