We're finally here together in 3D!

25
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,200
Yeah! And just for today,

26
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,800
for this special occasion,

27
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,800
we're back home here in the Northwest Passage

28
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,000
in Abbotsford!

29
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,700
Yeah, Ruffians!

30
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,600
Yeah, this is it! This is the Abbotsford home!

31
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,300
Can you believe it?

32
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,300
It's nice, right?

33
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,800
This is the place that these puppies grew up!

34
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,300
Yeah! And you know, I'm so excited for our first time to be in 3D,

35
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,200
but to tell the truth, I'm a bit nervous, Fuwa-chan...

36
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,200
Is it okay if I hide behind you, Fuwawa?

37
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,300
Moco-chan, no! You can't, okay?

38
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
This is our chance to show the Ruffians

39
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,600
just how fluffy and fuzzy we are, you know?

40
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Okay, I'll do my best then!

41
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Yeah! Ruffians, we have so much to show you!

42
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,800
But I know something that will help me calm down a bit.

43
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,800
Ruffians, can you do me a favor, please?

44
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,400
Well, can you please tweet with the hashtag...

45
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,500
#FWMC3D!

46
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,500

We'll go find them, okay?

00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:04,148
Hi!

53
00:05:04,248 --> 00:05:05,148
But...

54
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:06,248
Whoa!

55
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,548
It's time at last.

56
00:05:07,648 --> 00:05:08,548
What?

57
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:09,548
I'm... Hi!

58
00:05:09,648 --> 00:05:11,548
I'm still a bit nervous, though.

59
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:12,348
Hi!

60
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:14,548
Ca- Ca- Can you do the thing?

61
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,548
The thing?

62
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,148
The thing!

63
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:17,148
Ah, okay.

64
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:18,548
Okay, Mococo, are you ready?

65
00:05:18,648 --> 00:05:19,548
Yeah!

66
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:20,148
Okay.

67
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:23,148
Ei! Haha!

68
00:05:23,248 --> 00:05:24,548
Good. Now, Fuwawa, your turn!

69
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:25,148
Oh, my turn?

70
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:26,548
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Turn around, turn around!

71
00:05:26,648 --> 00:05:28,548
Is this just because you want to hit me?

72
00:05:28,648 --> 00:05:29,548
No! It's okay!

73
00:05:29,648 --> 00:05:30,148
Okay...

74
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:31,548
Okay, here we go!

75
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:34,548
Ei! Ow! Oh, wow!

76
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:37,148
Maybe I'm a bit better now.

77
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:38,148
You're good?

78
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:39,548
Yeah, I think I'm okay.

79
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:41,548
Oh, wow!

80
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:45,548
If we're ready now, maybe we could share a song with the Ruffians!

81
00:05:45,648 --> 00:05:46,548
Yeah!

82
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:48,548
Our first song for today!

83
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,548
Yeah, you know, it's a very important song to us.

84
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:56,548

00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:56,548
Thank you so much!

173
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:59,048
You know, it means so much to us to...

174
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:02,523
...today!

175
00:10:02,523 --> 00:10:03,523
Wow!

176
00:10:03,523 --> 00:10:04,223
Hot!

177
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,423
あつい！
Sweaty!

178
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:07,023
Did you notice something?

179
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,023
This was actually the full version of Lifetime Showtime!

180
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:12,323
You know, the first time ever!

181
00:10:12,323 --> 00:10:14,323
What did you think?

182
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:17,523
You know it has the BAU BAU BAU BAU...

183
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:20,523
We hope you enjoyed it!

184
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,523
But you know, now... I'm a bit sweaty.

185
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:26,523
Me too!

186
00:10:26,523 --> 00:10:28,123
So hot!

187
00:10:30,523 --> 00:10:34,523
Well, Lifetime Showtime is actually a song that we shared with you...

188
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:38,023
...for the very first time on the day we debuted...

189
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:41,523
...just a little bit more than a year ago.

190
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:43,023
Our introduction song.

191
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:45,323
You know, with Lifetime Showtime...

192
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:48,323
...we really hope that maybe you could tell us apart...

193
00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:51,523
...you know, because we're twins, sometimes it's a bit tricky to understand.

194
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:54,023
Yeah, twins! BAU BAU!

195
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:57,623
Yeah, it can be hard to understand.

196
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:04,523
Sometimes I see people...

197
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:07,323
...they still don't know. They can't tell the difference!

198
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:08,523
Why?! I'm fluffy!

199
00:11:08,523 --> 00:11:10,523
I'm fuzzy! Mococo's fuzzy!

Yeah! Why is it hard? BAU BAU!

201
00:11:13,523 --> 00:11:16,023
So, uh, maybe we should help them.

202
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:18,523
Maybe that would be good.

203
00:11:18,523 --> 00:11:21,323
Excuse me, I'm just gonna kind of steal this camera from you.

204
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:24,523
Oh, we'll be taking that.

...you know, do not touch. The ears are not allowed, okay?

No, they're good Ruffians.

00:16:30,346 --> 00:16:31,546
Oh! It's our house!

321
00:16:31,796 --> 00:16:35,396
Yeah, like this! Mention, this is our childhood home here in Northwest Passage.

322
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:37,146
Yeah, the Makai!

323
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:39,946
What do you think? Do you like it?

324
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:43,121
Is it a little bit different than you expected?

325
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:46,471
It's pretty nice! I mean, don't worry about the paint!

326
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:49,321
Yeah, you know, we just got into a little bit of fun and mischief!

327
00:16:50,146 --> 00:16:52,621
Yeah! Mama Puppy and Papa Puppy aren't home right now.

328
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,746
Yeah, don't worry about that, okay?

329
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:56,646
Don't bother knocking on the door!

330
00:16:57,021 --> 00:16:59,121
You can see they're not home! Wait, don't try!

331
00:17:00,196 --> 00:17:03,046
Yeah! But you know, Northwest Passage is just filled with lots of nature!

332
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:05,221
So let's go take a look over here!

333
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:09,196
You see these? They're the wild dande-bauwbauws!

334
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:10,646
Dande-bauwbauws!

335
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:12,721
They're so fluffy!

336
00:17:12,946 --> 00:17:16,196
Right? I love them so much! They're really nice to look at, just like the rest of it.

337
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:20,446
You know, some people, because they grow wild and everything, they think they're a nuisance.

338
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:22,571
But we love them, もこちゃん！ You know, our moons!
But we love them, Mococchi! You know, our moons!

339
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:25,921
Oh! Over here we have two moons, twin moons!

340
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:28,521
It's a bit different in the Northwest Passage, you know?

341
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:32,496
And you know, it's because of the twin moons that Mama Puppy received the blessing and that we're here now.

342
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:34,571
Don't you think they're so pretty?

343
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,521
Just look up at them and you want to go bauwbauwbauw!

344
00:17:38,346 --> 00:17:39,996
And over this way, we have a stream!

345
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:43,396
Yeah, it's really fun playing in it on a hot day, summertime! So many memories!

346
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,046
And back over this way!

347
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:47,221
Bauwbauw!

348
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:49,346
Right here, this is our Legendary Tree of Promise!

349
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:51,946
Yeah, a very special part of our home! You know, we can't be without it, right?

350
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:55,346
And actually, it's even more beautiful at night! But well, you'll just have to take our word for it.

351
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:56,921
Yeah, okay! Bauwbauw!

352
00:17:57,146 --> 00:17:58,271
Bauwbauw!

353
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:02,896
We're so happy to be able to share our home like this with you, Ruffians!

354
00:18:03,196 --> 00:18:04,321
Somewhere special!

355
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:07,521
I'm looking forward to making so many more memories with you, Ruffians!

356
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:08,896
Bauwbauw!

357
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,521
間違いなくこれは...
No mistake, this is...

358
00:19:10,646 --> 00:19:14,921
It's I, the Great Perocino! Bauwbauw!

359
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:20,521
Pero! Are you here to ruin our 3D debut, Bauwbauw?!

360
00:19:20,796 --> 00:19:24,521
Nah, I'd never do anything of the sort! You would?!

361
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:28,521
After all, the star of the show is finally here now! Your mentor, the Great Perocino!

362
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:31,521
The Ruffians have been waiting for me! Don't you hear it? They're chanting my name!

363
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,521
Ruffians? So were we just the opening act, Bauwbauw?

364
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:37,521
Pero, you're just our pet, okay? And a nasty one at that, okay?

365
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:39,021
You're not the star!

366
00:19:40,521 --> 00:19:43,121
No! I think it's time we put you in your place!

367
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:45,121
Bauwbauw! Let me!

368
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:46,521

00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:49,521
おっかよー！
Okkayo!

371
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:01,346
Come on, just like this!

372
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:02,146
Hi!

373
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:03,446
Fuwawa, catch!

374
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:05,146
Yah!

375
00:20:05,846 --> 00:20:07,146
Ouch! Mococo!

376
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:08,546
Hi! Stop!

377
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:14,246
Bau Bau! Mococo-chan!

378
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,846
Look how fluffy Pero is!

379
00:20:16,146 --> 00:20:18,446
Not as fluffy as me! Hi! Catch!

380
00:20:18,546 --> 00:20:20,346
Yah! Eh! Stop bumping him around!

381
00:20:20,546 --> 00:20:22,646
Yah! Hi! Let me see!

382
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:26,346
Give him a few punches!

383
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:28,746
Yah! Yah! Mococo-chan! Just like that!

384
00:20:29,846 --> 00:20:31,246
Stop! Hi!

385
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:33,746
Well, maybe I'll show you a bit of mercy, hi!

386
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:37,446
But you have to admit, we're super strong, right? Hi!

387
00:20:38,246 --> 00:20:40,846
Well, you aren't weak, I guess.

388
00:20:43,046 --> 00:20:46,046
Okay then, admit it, hi, that you're just our pet!

389
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:52,546
I am not your pet! I am your mentor! Respect Pero-chan!

390
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:54,646
No, no, no! Mococo-chan, we have to do something!

391
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:55,746
Quick! Bau bau him!

392
00:21:00,046 --> 00:21:03,046
Take this! Stop stretching me out!

393
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:06,046
What do you say? Do you apologize for being so nasty?

394
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:10,046
I'll never apologize!

395
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:13,046
Okay well, this is your last chance!

396
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:16,046
Never! I'll go down like this! I'm not done!

397
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:17,346
Okay then! Goodbye then!

398
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:19,446
Goodbye! Bau Bau!

399
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:32,446
Well, that was fun!

400
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:34,046
Hi! 楽しかったね！
Hi! That was fun, wasn't it?

401
00:21:34,146 --> 00:21:37,346
Do you think he understands us, Ruffians? Hi!

402
00:21:39,546 --> 00:21:42,546
Oh, Mococo-chan. Let's do a game of respect Pero, okay? Hi! No!

403
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:45,346
After all, the best thing about having a pet is playing with them, right?

404
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:48,046
Yah! The proper way of playing with a pet! Right!

405
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:52,046
Aegis Potato! Mogu Mogu! Aegis Potato! Mogu Mogu!

406
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:53,046
It's so much fun!

407
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,246
あ！誰かの気配！
Ah! I sense someone!

408
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:56,546
I feel someone's presence! Maybe...

409
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:58,546
More people who've said... hi!

410
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:05,546
It's a good smell, Mococo-chan, it's a good smell!

411
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:14,046
Wait... a bit of a cute smell maybe? A cute smell!

うん! 行こう!
Yeah! Let's go!

506
00:29:37,894 --> 00:29:44,294
あのね、歌って踊ってたら、お腹がちょっと鳴っちゃった!
You know, after all that singing and dancing, my tummy's gotten a bit rumbly!

507
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:45,694
鳴っちゃった?
Rumbly?

508
00:29:45,894 --> 00:29:48,594
うん、お腹空いちゃった!
Yeah, I'm a bit hungry!

509
00:29:48,894 --> 00:29:52,794
もしかして、あそこに行けるかな?
Hmm, maybe we can go to THAT place?

510
00:29:52,894 --> 00:29:55,594
アッ、名物も食べられるかな?
Ah, and maybe get a bit of a specialty?

511
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:59,894
名物! ラフィアンズのみんなも付いてきてくれるよね?
Specialty! Ruffians, you'll come along with us, right?

512
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:01,369
High! Okay!

513
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:02,369
High! Okay!

514
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,569
High! One, two... Let's go go!

515
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:10,569
Pon pon pon pon pon pon pon pon!

516
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:10,069
Pon pon pon pon pon pon pon pon!

517
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,569
Wow! High here!

518
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:15,569
It's Akihabara! Akiba! High!

519
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:18,069
Bau bau! High!

520
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:21,069
Look at all the buildings, the signboards!

521
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:25,069
Right! I can feel all of
Akihabara's electronic energy

522
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:27,069
getting me...

523
00:31:27,069 --> 00:31:30,569
Exciting! Biri biri! High!

524
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:33,569
Well you know Akihabara has a bunch
of different stories to tell too,

525
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:36,569
so let's check them out! High!

526
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:39,069
Well please, over here! High!

527
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:43,569
Over here! We have a pharmacy!

528
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:46,569
And it seems like right now,
their top seller

529
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:50,569
is something that will help when your
Bau-Bau's feel like really rough.

530
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:54,069
I heard that it's been kind of tough recently,

531
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:58,569
so if you need something, please go here!

532
00:31:58,569 --> 00:32:02,569
And over here! We have YAGO!

533
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:07,569
The arcade here in Akihabara,
the latest and greatest games.

534
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:11,069
Ah, but Fuwawa, I forgot my coins,

535
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:13,069
so is it okay if I depend on you

536
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:16,069
so that we can play some
games together?

537
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:18,569
High! Bau-Bau!

538
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:23,069
Well next, let's check out
the food! We have RAMEN! High!

539
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:27,069
You know in case you need something
to really fill you up

540
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:31,069
and get ready to enjoy more of Akihabara!

541
00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:35,069
This way! Next, over here! Over here! High!

542
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:39,569
We have the Pero Cafe!

543
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:41,069
I hear that they have some...

544
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:43,069
some sort of suspicious and nasty maids,

545
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:45,069
but I'm sure it's relaxing enough.

546
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:49,069
And you know they have
Pero-lattes as well! High!

547
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:53,069
In case you need something.
And right beside there's Cover Denki

548
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:58,569
for electronics. You know, they've been
in Akihabara for a long time,

549
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:02,069
so they're well-trusted. And in
this way, we have Game Island!

550
00:33:02,069 --> 00:33:05,569
You know there's lots of retro games,

551
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:09,069
so I'm sure if there's something you're
looking for, they have it! High!

552
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:13,069
And then back this way! High!
We have the train!

553
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:17,569
The trains just go by
BAU BAU BAU! BAU BAU BAU!

554
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:21,069
Ah, but we also have some
light stage lights. High!

555
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:25,069
I wonder why? That's kind of strange.
But you know when you're in Akihabara

556
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:28,069
you're most likely here for...

557
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:31,569

what did we come here for again?

00:35:37,517 --> 00:35:40,117
Ruffians, do you remember?

593
00:35:46,117 --> 00:35:50,117
Mococo-chan, tell me... I'm hungry! We're hungry!

594
00:35:50,117 --> 00:35:53,717
As you know, if you come to Akiba...

595
00:35:53,717 --> 00:35:55,817

00:36:07,617 --> 00:36:11,917
Ruffians, is it okay if you treat us to some donuts this time?

00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:29,117
Am-am-am-am-am!

606
00:36:29,117 --> 00:36:31,617
Wait, wait! What about Mococo?

607
00:36:31,617 --> 00:36:33,617

Am-am-am-am-am-am-am!

609
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:38,617
Where's my donut?

This time it's donuts! FuwaMoco power!

Okay, ready? Ah...

Am-am-am!

617
00:37:01,117 --> 00:37:05,117
This tastes a little fluffy!

618
00:37:05,117 --> 00:37:08,617
And mine... ah... am-am-am!

619
00:37:09,117 --> 00:37:12,117
It's a bit fuzzy and pink!

620
00:37:12,117 --> 00:37:16,617
Mococo-chan, I want to taste it too. Can I have a bite?

621
00:37:16,617 --> 00:37:20,117
I guess we'll share a bite or two? Okay...

622
00:37:20,117 --> 00:37:22,917
Only small, okay?

623
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:25,617
You heard it, okay? Here you go!

624
00:37:25,617 --> 00:37:28,617
Am-am-am-am-am!

625
00:37:28,617 --> 00:37:32,117
You ate it all! It's so fuzzy!

626
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:35,617
Okay, I get a bite now. Mococo-chan, just a small bite.

627
00:37:35,617 --> 00:37:39,617
Not as big as my bite, okay? I'll be fair.

628
00:37:40,117 --> 00:37:44,117
Okay, here you go... Ah...

629
00:37:44,117 --> 00:37:46,617
Am-am-am-am-am!

630
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:49,117
BAU BAU! It was great too!

631
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:54,117
But you know, I still want my donut. I only had one!

632
00:37:54,117 --> 00:37:58,117
Mococo, I would like my donut!

633
00:37:58,117 --> 00:38:02,117
Donuts! Donuts! Donuts!

634
00:38:02,117 --> 00:38:04,617
一個残りあった！
There was one left!

635
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:10,117
Mococo, you know, I've been looking forward to the donuts so much!

636
00:38:10,117 --> 00:38:13,617
No, no, it's not fair! It has to be equal!

637
00:38:13,617 --> 00:38:17,117
No! No! It's mine! It's mine!

638
00:38:17,117 --> 00:38:19,617
Well, then we only have one choice!

639
00:38:21,117 --> 00:38:23,617
BAU BAU! What is this?

640
00:38:24,117 --> 00:38:27,617
A wrestling ring?!

641
00:38:27,617 --> 00:38:31,117
This is... FUWAMOCO WRESTLING!

642
00:38:31,117 --> 00:38:34,117

So fuzzy, so fluffy!

646
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:51,117
Thank you for coming to cheer us on!

647
00:38:51,117 --> 00:38:55,617
Mococo, I'll make sure that I beat up Mococo-chan a lot, okay?

648
00:38:55,617 --> 00:38:58,617
No, I'm gonna win, okay?

649
00:38:58,617 --> 00:39:02,117
I'm gonna do my best, okay?

650
00:39:02,117 --> 00:39:07,617
BAU BAU!

651
00:39:07,617 --> 00:39:12,117
Mococo-chan, I won't let you take that donut!

652
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,617
No, it's mine!

653
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:17,117
Stretch! Stretch!

654
00:39:17,617 --> 00:39:21,117
Okay... let's get a bit more ready, Mococo-chan!

655
00:39:21,117 --> 00:39:23,617
Take off the jackets!

656
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:34,117
BAU BAU! All ready!

657
00:39:34,117 --> 00:39:38,117
Wow, wow, wow! I, the Great Pero-chino,

658
00:39:38,117 --> 00:39:42,617
will be the referee for today's fight!

659
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:46,617
I guess we have a nasty referee for a nasty fight then!

660
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:49,617
But it's going to be fair because... Pero-chin!

1000
01:03:55,738 --> 01:03:59,638
追いつけなくて
I can't catch up

1001
01:04:23,238 --> 01:04:26,638
Thank you! Thank you!

1002
01:04:26,638 --> 01:04:30,638
Oh, we're back in the forest passage! Whoa!

1003
01:04:30,638 --> 01:04:35,638
Just like we said, it's so beautiful at nighttime! Ah!

1004
01:04:36,638 --> 01:04:40,638
Oh, we really wanted to share this view together with you! Hi!

1005
01:04:40,638 --> 01:04:44,638
For a long time that we waited for it, right Mococo-chan?

1006
01:04:44,638 --> 01:04:45,638
Right! Uh!

1007
01:04:45,638 --> 01:04:50,338
And today, we're able to sing the songs that we really loved here for you!

1008
01:04:50,338 --> 01:04:51,138
Yeah!

1009
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:53,138
In the place that we grew up.

1010
01:04:53,138 --> 01:04:55,438
Uh, it means so much to us!

1011
01:04:55,638 --> 01:04:59,138
But you know, we're no longer puppies, so you know...

1012
01:05:00,186 --> 01:05:00,786
One, two!

1013
01:05:00,786 --> 01:05:01,386
Yeah!

1014
01:05:01,486 --> 01:05:03,686
Hai! Hai! Hai!
Hi! Hi! Hi!

1015
01:05:04,086 --> 01:05:05,186
Actually...

1016
01:05:05,286 --> 01:05:06,986
...there's something, right Mococo?

1017
01:05:07,586 --> 01:05:09,686
There's something we wanted to tell you!

1018
01:05:10,586 --> 01:05:12,986
Is it okay if we go out that way?

1019
01:05:13,586 --> 01:05:14,386
Let's go!

1020
01:05:14,486 --> 01:05:15,386
こっち行こう！
Let's go this way!

1021
01:05:15,486 --> 01:05:16,686
行こう！
Let's go!

1022
01:05:21,586 --> 01:05:22,586
Abyssgard!

1023
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:23,686
Abyssgard!

1024
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:26,686
Right here, right under the tree of Abyssgard.

1025
01:05:27,286 --> 01:05:29,686
Yeah, the tree of Abyssgard.

1026
01:05:30,986 --> 01:05:33,386
It's a very special tree to us demon dogs,

1027
01:05:33,586 --> 01:05:36,186
but especially us demon guard dogs.

1028
01:05:37,386 --> 01:05:40,686
We'd like to sing our last song for today right here.

1029
01:05:40,986 --> 01:05:41,986
Right here.

1030
01:05:42,686 --> 01:05:45,086
And this song means so much to us...

1031
01:05:45,186 --> 01:05:46,686
...because it's all for you.

1032
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:51,686
You know, all of it. Everything is for you.

1033
01:05:52,386 --> 01:05:54,686
Thank you so much always.

1034
01:05:55,486 --> 01:05:58,686
Well, please listen to our last song for today.

1035
01:05:59,386 --> 01:06:01,686
Kimi ga Tame.

1036
01:06:11,386 --> 01:06:14,186
きみの瞳に映る
Reflected in your eyes

1037
01:06:14,386 --> 01:06:18,186
キミガタメ Lyrics: 須谷尚子 Music: 下川直哉
Kimi ga Tame Lyrics: Naoko Sutani Music: Naoya Shimokawa

1038
01:06:15,386 --> 01:06:18,186
きみの瞳に映る
Reflected in your eyes

1039
01:06:19,186 --> 01:06:23,986
わたしは何色ですか
What color am I?

1040
01:06:25,386 --> 01:06:31,186
赤深き望むなら
If you wish for a deep red

1041
01:06:31,786 --> 01:06:38,386
渡そう 陽の光を
I'll hand over the sunlight

1042
01:07:04,386 --> 01:07:09,386
悲しみが溢れ
Sadness overflows

1043
01:07:10,186 --> 01:07:15,186
瞼 閉じました
I closed my eyelids

1044
01:07:16,386 --> 01:07:21,186
こぼれた滴は
The spilled droplets

1045
01:07:22,186 --> 01:07:27,186
心に沁みゆく
Soak into the heart

1046
01:07:28,386 --> 01:07:33,386
行き渡る波は
The waves that spread

1047
01:07:34,186 --> 01:07:38,986
弱く 舞いえます
Can dance weakly

1048
01:07:40,186 --> 01:07:44,986
とどけし揺りかご
The delivered cradle

1049
01:07:45,986 --> 01:07:50,986
眠りを誘う
Invites sleep

1050
01:07:52,186 --> 01:07:56,986
夢に なつかしい
Nostalgic in dreams

1051
01:07:57,586 --> 01:08:02,986
面影をさがす
Searching for traces

1052
01:08:04,186 --> 01:08:08,986
手を伸ばし 強く
Reach out your hand strongly

1053
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:14,786
抱きしめたくなる
I want to hold you tight

1054
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:24,186
きみの瞳に映る
Reflected in your eyes

1055
01:08:25,186 --> 01:08:29,986
わたしは何色ですか
What color am I?

1056
01:08:31,386 --> 01:08:36,186
藍深き望むなら
If you wish for a deep indigo

1057
01:08:37,386 --> 01:08:42,386
渡そう 高き空を
I'll hand over the high sky

1058
01:08:55,586 --> 01:09:00,386
喜びが溢れ
Joy overflows

1059
01:09:01,186 --> 01:09:06,186
巡りあいました
We met each other

1060
01:09:07,186 --> 01:09:11,986
こぼれおつ笑みは
The smiles that spill out

1061
01:09:13,186 --> 01:09:18,186
別れを隠す
Hide the parting

1062
01:09:19,186 --> 01:09:23,986
人は いつしか
People eventually

1063
01:09:24,986 --> 01:09:29,686
朽ち果てるけれど
Rot away, but

1064
01:09:31,186 --> 01:09:35,986
唄となり
Becoming a song

1065
01:09:36,986 --> 01:09:41,986
語り継がれてゆくでしょう
It will be passed down, won't it

1066
01:09:46,386 --> 01:09:51,386
きみの瞳に映る
Reflected in your eyes

1067
01:09:52,186 --> 01:09:56,986
わたしは何色ですか
What color am I?

1068
01:09:57,786 --> 01:10:00,186
緑深き望むなら
If you wish for a deep green

1069
01:10:00,161 --> 01:10:04,361
緑深き望むなら
If you wish for the deep green

1070
01:10:04,361 --> 01:10:09,661
渡そうこの大地を
I'll give you this land

1071
01:10:34,661 --> 01:10:41,161
脆く儚げなものよ
Oh, such a fragile and fleeting thing

1072
01:10:46,561 --> 01:10:52,961
強く美しきものよ
Oh, such a strong and beautiful thing

1073
01:10:53,161 --> 01:11:00,661
あるがまま ha-
Just as you are, ha-

1074
01:11:00,661 --> 01:11:07,161
きみの瞳に映る
Reflected in your eyes

1075
01:11:07,161 --> 01:11:13,161
わたしは何色ですか
What color am I?

1076
01:11:13,361 --> 01:11:19,161
安らぎを覚えたなら
If you feel a sense of peace

1077
01:11:19,161 --> 01:11:24,961
そこにわたしはいる
I'll be right there

1078
01:11:25,161 --> 01:11:31,161
きみの瞳に映る
Reflected in your eyes

1079
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:37,161
わたしは何色ですか
What color am I?

1080
01:11:37,361 --> 01:11:43,161
うら深き望むなら
If you wish for the inner depths

1081
01:11:43,161 --> 01:11:49,161
渡そうこの想いを
I'll give you these feelings

1082
01:11:49,361 --> 01:11:57,161
渡そうこのすべてを
I'll give you everything

1083
01:13:10,661 --> 01:13:15,961
Ah, thank you so much, Ruffians! Thank you!

1084
01:13:17,361 --> 01:13:21,961
You know, we're not the best at
expressing our feelings through words,

1085
01:13:22,161 --> 01:13:24,561
but you know, today is a special day.

1086
01:13:25,661 --> 01:13:31,361
So you know, we did our best
and we wrote some letters for you.

1087
01:13:32,561 --> 01:13:33,961
Is it okay?

1088
01:13:37,161 --> 01:13:40,561
Do you want to hear them? Do you?

1089
01:13:40,961 --> 01:13:43,161
Okay! Okay!

1090
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:55,461
Fuwawa, I'll go first, then okay? Okay.

1091
01:13:58,661 --> 01:14:00,361
Dear Ruffians,

1092
01:14:00,661 --> 01:14:03,561
Thank you for all the fluffy headpats,

1093
01:14:03,561 --> 01:14:05,561
for all your warmth,

1094
01:14:05,561 --> 01:14:08,961
and for always being here for me
during this past year.

1095
01:14:09,661 --> 01:14:12,561
I never would have dreamed that I could be

1096
01:14:12,561 --> 01:14:16,161
standing here right now,
having already done so many

1097
01:14:16,161 --> 01:14:21,161
amazing things a little more than a year
from the day we first met,

1098
01:14:21,661 --> 01:14:24,161
but here I am!

1099
01:14:24,661 --> 01:14:27,661
And it's truly all thanks to you.

1100
01:14:28,161 --> 01:14:30,961
There have been many sunny days

1101
01:14:30,961 --> 01:14:33,561
and some rainy ones too,

1102
01:14:34,361 --> 01:14:39,161
but they've all been special
and full of meaning because

1103
01:14:39,161 --> 01:14:42,661
you know what?
You were there by my side.

1104
01:14:44,661 --> 01:14:48,561
Thank you from the bottom of my heart...

1105
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:52,661
Please continue to share
that beautiful smile of yours

1106
01:14:52,661 --> 01:14:55,161
with me lots and lots,

1107
01:14:55,161 --> 01:14:58,961
and I'll make sure that nothing
can lay a paw on it. Okay?

1108
01:15:00,209 --> 01:15:02,309
Sincerely, your fluffy Fuwawa.

1109
01:15:02,309 --> 01:15:05,309
Bau bau!

1110
01:15:13,309 --> 01:15:15,509
Ah, next, Mococo-chan, your turn.

1111
01:15:15,909 --> 01:15:17,809
I guess it's my turn then, huh?

1112
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:20,809
I'll do my best, huh!

1113
01:15:22,109 --> 01:15:23,909
Ruffians!

1114
01:15:24,609 --> 01:15:28,609
I can't believe we're finally here, after so long.

1115
01:15:29,209 --> 01:15:33,409
I'm so happy we've been able to spend today together.

1116
01:15:34,209 --> 01:15:36,409
To be honest, there were many hard times...

1117
01:15:38,009 --> 01:15:43,009
times when we doubted ourselves and were frustrated with our own limits...

1118
01:15:43,609 --> 01:15:49,009
but because you were here by my side with kind words and lots of headpats...

1119
01:15:49,209 --> 01:15:54,809
because you accepted me even when I was maybe a bit needy or being silly...

1120
01:15:55,109 --> 01:15:57,809
because of that, we were able to reach today!

1121
01:15:58,509 --> 01:16:01,109
There's still a lot of growing I have to do, but I...

1122
01:16:01,409 --> 01:16:07,609
hope you can watch me do my best and take even one step forward everyday.

1123
01:16:08,009 --> 01:16:12,509
Because you know, one step forward a day is seven steps a week!

1124
01:16:12,809 --> 01:16:16,609
And eventually, that will amount to something amazing.

1125
01:16:17,009 --> 01:16:22,009
And of course, I will always be waiting here for you, ready to protect your smile!

1126
01:16:22,509 --> 01:16:26,209
Nothing will ever break the pledge we made to you.

1127
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:32,609
So get ready, because your smile is going to be protected, whether you like it or not!

1128
01:16:32,609 --> 01:16:33,709
Got it?

1129
01:16:34,209 --> 01:16:36,709
Sincerely, your fuzzy Mococo.

1130
01:16:37,209 --> 01:16:39,709

Today, another huge dream of ours has come true.

1135
01:16:50,609 --> 01:16:53,809
Thank you so much, always.

1136
01:16:50,609 --> 01:16:53,809
Thank you so much, always.

1137
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:59,209
Please let us continue to protect your smile for-ever and ever, okay?

1138
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:59,209
Please let us continue to protect your smile for-ever and ever, okay?

1139
01:16:59,409 --> 01:17:01,509

1147
01:18:32,509 --> 01:18:34,009
Dearest Ruffians,

1148
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:38,009
Thank you for always being by our sides!!

1149
01:18:38,009 --> 01:18:43,009
We had so much fun wrestling, singing and dancing for you in 3D!

1150
01:18:43,009 --> 01:18:47,009
We're going to protect your smile furr-ever & ever!
