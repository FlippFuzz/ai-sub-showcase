that maybe things might be a little bit silly today too!

153
00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:08,556
Silly, oh! Especially with all the fun we have planned!

154
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:12,556
Yeah, you know, and our special guests! Oh, special guests! Yeah!

155
00:14:12,556 --> 00:14:15,556
So we hope that you'll cheer us on lots and lots

156
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:20,056
as we sing and dance together with them, okay? Oh, wow!

157
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:24,056
For our next song, we wanted to share a song that's very special to us.

158
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:28,556
It kind of goes back to our roots... oh, our roots!

159
00:14:28,556 --> 00:14:34,556
Our demon roots! Grrr... Bau Bau! Yeah, oh!

160
00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:40,556
Fuwamoco are very fluffy, fuzzy, and silly, but...

161
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:45,556
we're demon dogs, you know! Very hungry demon dogs! Oh, bau, yeah!

162
00:14:45,556 --> 00:14:51,056
You know, we might look cute, but don't doubt our strength, okay?

163
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,056
Yeah! Oh! Got it! Oh!

164
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:56,556
Please listen to our next song then. Kaibutsu.
Please listen to our next song then. Monster.

165
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:03,271
怪物
Monster

166
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:05,504
素晴らしき世界に今日も乾杯
Cheers to this wonderful world again today

167
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,604
街に飛び交う笑い声も
Even the laughter echoing through the city

168
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:11,504
見て見ぬふりしてるだけの作りもんさ
is just a fabrication we pretend not to see

169
00:15:11,604 --> 00:15:13,504
気が触れそうだ
I feel like I'm going crazy

170
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:17,404
クラクラするほどの良い匂いが ツンと刺した鼻の奥
The scent, so sweet it makes me dizzy, pricks the back of my nose

171
00:15:17,471 --> 00:15:20,237
目を醒ます本能のまま
Following my waking instincts

172
00:15:20,237 --> 00:15:23,071
今日は誰の番だ？
whose turn is it today?

173
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:26,571
この世界で何ができるのか
What can I do in this world?

174
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:29,771
僕には何ができるのか
What can I do?

175
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:32,937
ただその真っ黒な目から
Just so that from those pitch-black eyes

176
00:15:32,937 --> 00:15:35,871
涙こぼれ落ちないように
tears don't spill

177
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:39,037
Ah 願う未来に
Ah, to the future I wish for

178
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:41,804
何度でもずっと 喰らいつく
I'll keep biting into it over and over

179
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:44,837
この間違いだらけの世界の中
In this world full of mistakes

180
00:15:44,837 --> 00:15:47,404
君には笑ってほしいから
I want you to be smiling

181
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:49,837
もう誰も傷つけない
I don't want to hurt anyone anymore

182
00:15:49,837 --> 00:15:52,637
強く強くなりたいんだよ
I want to become strong, so strong

183
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:55,404
僕が僕でいられるように
So that I can remain myself

184
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:07,571
素晴らしき世界は今日も安泰
The wonderful world is peaceful again today

185
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:10,604
街に渦巻く悪い話も
Even the bad rumors swirling in the city

186
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:13,504
知らない知らないふりして目を逸らした
I pretended not to know and looked away

187
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:15,504
正気の沙汰じゃないな
This isn't sanity

188
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:18,237
真面目に着飾った行進
A march dressed in seriousness

189
00:16:18,237 --> 00:16:21,104
鳴らす足音が弾む
the sound of footsteps bouncing

190
00:16:21,204 --> 00:16:25,071
行き先は消えない消えない味が染み付いている
The destination is stained with an indelible, lingering taste

191
00:16:25,171 --> 00:16:27,571
裏側の世界
The world on the other side

192
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:38,371
Ah...

193
00:16:38,471 --> 00:16:40,904
清く正しく生きること
Living purely and honestly

194
00:16:40,904 --> 00:16:43,404
誰も悲しませずに生きること
living without making anyone sad

195
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,004
はみ出さず真っ直ぐに生きること
Living straight without straying

196
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:48,937
それが間違わないで生きること？
is that what it means to live without mistakes?

197
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:51,604
ありのまま生きることが正義か
Is living as you are justice?

198
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:54,137
騙し騙し生きるのは正義か
Is living by deceiving justice?

199
00:16:54,237 --> 00:16:57,304
僕の在るべき姿とは何だ
What is the way I should be?

200
00:16:57,404 --> 00:17:00,104
本当の僕は誰何者なんだ
Who am I really?

201
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:01,137
教えてくれよ
Tell me!

202
00:17:05,704 --> 00:17:09,571
教えてくれよ
Tell me!

203
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:14,437
今日も答えのない世界の中で
Even today, in a world without answers

204
00:17:14,437 --> 00:17:17,337
願ってるんだよ
I'm wishing

205
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:20,237
不器用だけれど
Awkward as I am

206
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:23,037
いつまでも君とただ笑っていたいから
I just want to be laughing with you forever

207
00:17:23,137 --> 00:17:25,871
跳ねる心臓が体揺らし
My racing heart shakes my body

208
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:28,504
叫ぶんだよ
and screams

209
00:17:28,604 --> 00:17:30,871
今こそ動き出せ
Move out now!

210
00:17:31,004 --> 00:17:33,504
Ah 弱い自分を
Ah, my weak self

211
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:35,404
何度でもずっと 喰らいつく
I'll keep biting into it over and over

212
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:38,004
この間違いだらけの世界の中
In this world full of mistakes

213
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:40,504
君には笑ってほしいから
I want you to be smiling

214
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:43,104
もう誰も泣かないよう
So that no one cries anymore

215
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,071
強く強くなりたいんだよ
I want to become strong, so strong

216
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:48,937
僕が僕でいられるように
So that I can remain myself

217
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:05,004
ただ君を守る
Just to protect you

218
00:18:05,004 --> 00:18:08,337
そのために走る 走る 走るんだよ
for that, I'll run, run, run

219
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:11,071
僕の中の僕を超える
Exceeding the me within myself

220
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,271
悲しみキャリブレーション
Kanashimi Calibration

221
00:19:02,237 --> 00:19:06,571
口づけさえ今は悲しいだけ
Even a kiss is only sad now

222
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:09,571
君の心
Your heart

223
00:19:09,571 --> 00:19:12,504
どこか置き去りのまま
remains left behind somewhere

224
00:19:12,604 --> 00:19:16,904
当たり前に見えたあの優しさ
That kindness that seemed so natural

225
00:19:17,004 --> 00:19:19,804
きっと他の誰かの
will surely become

226
00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:22,504
ものになる
someone else's

227
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:24,237
揺れる心
Trembling heart

228
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:25,871
迷う気持ち
lost feelings

229
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:27,504
どこにおけばいいの
where should I put them?

230
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:30,571
重なりあう手も
Our overlapping hands

231
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:33,504
古くさくないの
aren't old-fashioned

232
00:19:33,637 --> 00:19:36,037
焦る私
I'm panicking

233
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:37,237
孤独になる
getting lonely

234
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:38,337
二人きりなのに
even though it's just the two of us

235
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:41,337
届かない
Can't reach

236
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:44,271
声も届かない
even my voice can't reach

237
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:46,871
何もできない私
I can't do anything

238
00:19:46,871 --> 00:19:49,271
ただのマリオネット
just a marionette

239
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:51,937
君目指したディスティネーション
The destination aiming for you

240

00:19:54,537 --> 00:19:57,037
聞きたくない
I don't want to hear

242
00:19:57,037 --> 00:19:59,404
知りたくもない
I don't want to know

243
00:20:00,386 --> 00:20:02,886
チグハグになるコンビネーション
A combination that's becoming mismatched

244
00:20:02,886 --> 00:20:05,486
泣き出しそうなグラデーション
A gradation that looks like it's about to cry

245
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:10,586
私 どんな顔でいればいいかな
What kind of face should I make?

246
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:13,286
冗談だよね
It's a joke, right?

247
00:20:13,286 --> 00:20:15,586
好きだよって言ってよ
Tell me you love me

248
00:20:26,586 --> 00:20:31,586
胸に刺さる 棘はいつからだよ
Since when was this thorn stuck in my heart?

249
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:36,586
見えない壁 それは気づかぬフリ
An invisible wall, I pretend not to notice it

250
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:41,586
優しいフリ 今更しなくても
You don't have to pretend to be kind now

251
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:46,586
行きと分かってるのにできないの
I know how it goes, but I just can't do it

252
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:51,586
望む愛は昔ほど 手に入らないもの
The love I want is no longer as easy to get

253
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:57,086
他の誰かでは埋められないもの
Something that no one else can fill

254
00:20:57,086 --> 00:21:02,586
疑問さえも不満さえも出てるのに
Even though doubts and frustrations are surfacing

255
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:05,086
私動けない
I can't move

256
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:07,586
想い許せない
I can't forgive these feelings

257
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:13,086
後悔しちゃう 心 抑えきれない

262
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:30,086
受け入れないよ レボリューション
I won't accept it, revolution

263
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:34,586
強がることしか 今はできない
All I can do now is pretend to be strong

264
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:37,086
冗談だよね
It's a joke, right?

265
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:39,586
嘘だよって言ってよ
Tell me it's a lie

266

さよなら さよなら
Goodbye, goodbye

282
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,586
Bau bau!

283
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:13,086
We surprised you, Ruffians!

284
00:23:13,086 --> 00:23:18,086
And now Fuwawa and Mococo with Advent's Demon Dogs of the Throne, Bau Bau!

285
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:20,586
You get it now, Ruffians?

286
00:23:20,586 --> 00:23:22,586
Bau Bau!

287
00:23:22,586 --> 00:23:29,086
We hope you enjoyed seeing just a bit more of our power and not just cute fluff and fuzz all the time.

288
00:23:29,086 --> 00:23:32,586
And you know, together with Advent, we were able to sing...

289
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:37,086
...an idol song that we love called Kanashimi Calibration.

290
00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:41,586
And you know, this song has been really, really special to us...

291
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:47,586
...because it was a song that we wanted to sing together with Advent all the way back when we were together in the cell.

292
00:23:47,586 --> 00:23:51,086
And Ruffians, your calls were absolutely amazing!

293
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:55,086
Great job, Ruffians! Thank you!

294
00:23:55,086 --> 00:23:59,086
Destination! Right? Very, very hot!

295
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:04,586
Yeah, you gave us so much power during that last part of our performance there.

296
00:24:04,586 --> 00:24:08,086
Thank you, Ruffians!

297
00:24:08,086 --> 00:24:12,586
But, you know, we've shown you a little bite of what these Demon Dogs have.

298
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:18,086
But we want to be able to show the Ruffians lots of different sides of FuwaMoco today, right?

299
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:20,586
Right!

300
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:24,086
That side? All the sides.

301
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:29,586
But, you know, the next side is... it's a challenging side, Mocchan.

302
00:24:29,586 --> 00:24:33,586
It's going to be a bit of a challenge, okay?

303
00:23:33,586 --> 00:24:40,086
You know, FuwaMoco, we wanted to show a bit more of a "feeling" side.

304
00:24:40,086 --> 00:24:44,086
A feeling side... Oh, maybe a bit more...

305
00:24:44,086 --> 00:24:47,086
...sexy?

306
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:51,586
Sexy? Sexy?

307
00:24:51,586 --> 00:24:56,086
Yeah, 'cause you know, Mococo is sexy, right?

308
00:24:56,086 --> 00:24:58,586
Right?

309
00:24:58,586 --> 00:24:59,586
Huh?

310
00:24:59,586 --> 00:25:01,086
Huh? Do I hear your voice?

311
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:01,001
Yes!

312
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:03,567
No, no, no.

313
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:06,101
Yes! Well, I'll prove it to you, okay?

314
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:08,867
Okay, Mococo-sa, you do your best, okay?

315
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:09,601
Yeah!

316
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:15,667
Ugh, but to be able to do that, we've prepared some solo songs for you today!

317
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:17,434
Yay! Bau Bau!

318
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:18,534
No...

319
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:24,501
Not only is it going to be a bit of a challenge, but it'll be our first time dancing and singing on our own for you!

320
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:29,667
So, I... to tell the truth, I'm a little bit nervous.

321
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:32,501
Huh? Mococo-chan, nervous?

322
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:35,034
Oh no way! Never happened! Oh!

323
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:38,867
So, I'll do my best, but you need to make sure to give me lots of headpats, okay?

324
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:40,501
I'll give you headpats too!

325
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:41,101
Yeah!

326
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:44,134
Okay! Well, I'm too nervous right now.

327
00:25:44,134 --> 00:25:46,167
Okay, Mococo-chan, let's decide who's going to go...

328
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:47,001
No!

329
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:47,567
Huh?

330
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:52,301
I'm... because this is now... I want to go first! I want it! Yeah.

331
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:58,301
Okay, well, Mococo-chan, you have to go after though, okay?

332
00:25:58,301 --> 00:25:59,534
I guess.

333
00:25:59,534 --> 00:26:00,934
Let- Let me do it otherwise!

334
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,267
Huh? Yeah!

335
00:26:02,267 --> 00:26:04,367
Do your best, okay?

336
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:05,201
Okay!

337
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:06,501
Bye bye!

338
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:07,867
Bau Bau!

339
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,634
Well, Bau Bau!

340
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:16,201
I guess it's time for me to take you back a few years with this next song.

341
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:19,567
Please listen to: MUGO・ん…色っぽい.

00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:43,867
言えないのよ
I can't say it

345
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:50,601
言いたいことならどれくらい
How much is there that I want to say

346
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:54,367
あるかわからなくあふれてる
It's overflowing so much I don't even know

00:26:54,367 --> 00:26:57,401
私こちらの
I am normally

348
00:26:57,401 --> 00:27:02,101
お喋りだわ
quite a chatterbox

349
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:05,901
言いたいことならあなたには
There are things I want to say to you

350
00:27:05,901 --> 00:27:09,701
あとからあとからあふれてる
overflowing one after another

00:27:09,701 --> 00:27:12,734
私意外と
I am unexpectedly

352
00:27:12,734 --> 00:27:16,834
お喋りだわ なのに
quite a chatterbox, and yet

353
00:27:17,234 --> 00:27:22,667
いざとなるとうちきになる
when the time comes, I become shy

354
00:27:23,634 --> 00:27:26,801
遠い場所から
From a far away place

355
00:27:26,801 --> 00:27:32,167
何度も話しかけてるのに
even though I've spoken to you many times

356
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:35,634
目と目で通じ合う
Communicating eye to eye

357
00:27:35,634 --> 00:27:38,834
かすかに、ん、色っぽい
faintly, hmm, looking sexy

358

そういう仲になりたいわ
that's the kind of relationship I want to have

360
00:27:46,101 --> 00:27:49,134
無言 いくじなしね
Silence, how cowardly

361
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:52,501
無言 寂しがりね
Silence, how lonely

362
00:27:59,134 --> 00:28:02,167
言いたいことならあの日から
The things I've wanted to say since that day

363
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:06,234
誰にも負けずにあふれてる

私気持ちは
My feelings are

365
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:12,734
わがままだわ なのに
quite selfish, and yet

366
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:18,734
いざとなるとうちきになる
when the time comes, I become shy

367
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:22,234
書いた手紙も
Even the letter I wrote

368
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:27,801

明日 少し勇気を出して
Tomorrow, I'll have a little courage

378
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:24,067
視線投げてみようかしら
and maybe I'll try to catch your eye

379
00:29:24,701 --> 00:29:27,767

言えないのよ
I can't say it

389
00:30:00,116 --> 00:30:01,616
…さよなら。
...Goodbye.

390
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:30,616
筋肉を
Muscles...

391
00:30:30,716 --> 00:30:33,116
筋肉を触らせてよ
Let me touch your muscles

392
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,616
どんな感じなのかい？
What do they feel like?

393
00:30:36,116 --> 00:30:38,616
興味があるのよ
I'm curious

394
00:30:39,116 --> 00:30:43,316
男の子って不思議だね
Boys are mysterious, aren't they?

00:30:46,116 --> 00:30:48,116
わるきー
Warukii

396
00:30:48,316 --> 00:30:52,616
Hey, you know, Mococo is sexy too, right?

397
00:30:53,116 --> 00:30:57,316
Is it okay if I brush up against those big muscles of yours?

398
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:59,116
Bau bau!

399
00:30:59,616 --> 00:31:04,016
今日のバッグなんだか重くて
My bag today is somehow heavy

400
00:31:04,116 --> 00:31:10,116
そう 誰かに持たせて欲しかった
Yes, I wanted someone to carry it for me

401
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:15,116
だから ちょっと甘えてみて
So I tried acting a bit spoiled

402
00:31:15,216 --> 00:31:19,616
ハートを釣ってみた
And tried to hook your heart

403
00:31:21,616 --> 00:31:26,616
甘い溜息一つチラリと見て
Give a quick glance at one sweet sigh

404
00:31:27,616 --> 00:31:32,116
おねだりするのよ わるきー
And start begging, the bad girl

405
00:31:34,116 --> 00:31:39,116
筋肉を触らせてよ どれくらい硬いの？
Let me touch your muscles, how hard are they?

406
00:31:40,616 --> 00:31:44,616
女の子には興味津々
Girls are very curious

407
00:31:45,116 --> 00:31:47,916
逞しさ見てみたいのよ
I want to see your sturdiness

408
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:51,616
どんな感じなのかい？
What does it feel like?

409
00:31:52,116 --> 00:31:54,116
ワクワクしてるわ
I'm getting excited

410
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:57,916
上腕二頭筋てセクシーだね
Biceps are sexy, aren't they?

411
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:02,116
これを持って！
Hold this!

412
00:32:03,116 --> 00:32:07,616
男らしいマッチョがタイプよ
Manly macho guys are my type

413
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:13,116
でも 本当はそんなことないけど
But actually, that's not really true

414
00:32:14,116 --> 00:32:18,616
じっと見つめおだててあげなきゃ
I have to stare at you and flatter you

415
00:32:19,616 --> 00:32:23,616
何も釣れないわ
Or I won't catch anything

416
00:32:24,616 --> 00:32:30,116
こっちが頼んじゃなくてやらせてくれて
It's not that I'm asking, but let me do it

417
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:36,616
頼まれるように わるきー
So that you ask me instead, the bad girl

418
00:32:38,116 --> 00:32:43,116
筋肉に抱かれたいの いつの日がどこかで
I want to be embraced by muscles, someday, somewhere

419
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:48,616
私のために頑張って
Do your best for me

420
00:32:49,116 --> 00:32:54,616
筋肉に抱かれたいの 折れるくらい強く
I want to be embraced by muscles, as strong as if they'd break

421
00:32:55,116 --> 00:32:58,116
胸が熱くなるよ
My heart starts racing

422
00:32:58,216 --> 00:33:01,316
腹筋だって割れてるし…
Even your abs are ripped...

423
00:33:01,616 --> 00:33:05,616
これを持って！
Hold this!

424
00:33:10,116 --> 00:33:14,316
Hmm, you really are mysterious, aren't you?

425
00:33:14,616 --> 00:33:18,316
Or maybe it's just that I like exploring stars.

426
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:22,616
Hey! Hey hey! Will you help me get past my embarrassment?

427
00:33:23,116 --> 00:33:25,116
Bau bau!

428
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:30,116
髪をかきあげながら ため息つくように
While running my fingers through my hair, like letting out a sigh

429
00:33:31,616 --> 00:33:36,616
反応を見るわ わるきー
I'll watch your reaction, the bad girl

430
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:43,116
筋肉を触らせてよ どれくらい硬いの？
Let me touch your muscles, how hard are they?

431
00:33:44,616 --> 00:33:48,616

432
00:33:49,116 --> 00:33:52,616
逞しさ見てみたいのよ
I want to see your sturdiness

433
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:55,616

What does it feel like?

434
00:33:56,116 --> 00:33:58,116

上腕二頭筋てセクシーだね
Biceps are sexy, aren't they?

436
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:06,616
全部持って！
Hold it all!

437
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:12,916
Oh no! Mococo's side show is ending!

438
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:16,616
Well then, can you close your eyes for me?

439
00:34:17,116 --> 00:34:19,916
Hey, why are you peeking? Gosh!

440
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,616
Bau bau!

441
00:34:38,316 --> 00:34:41,616
Oh! What did you think, Ruffians?

442
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:44,316
My performance, Mococo in a play...

443
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,616
Mococo-chan's Warukii!

444
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,116
Mococo-chan!

445
00:34:48,716 --> 00:34:51,616
Why did it have to be such an embarrassing song, though?

446
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:55,616
I thought it fit you perfectly, Mococo-chan! Bau bau!

447
00:34:55,716 --> 00:34:57,616
Huh? Was it okay, Ruffians?

448
00:34:58,116 --> 00:35:00,116
Was it... sexy?

449
00:35:00,481 --> 00:35:01,431
いえす。
Yes.

450
00:35:01,531 --> 00:35:03,581
It was... It was...

451
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:07,581
えー、もしかしたらこれの練習をすればいいんじゃない、モコちゃん？
Um, maybe we could work on that, Mococo-chan?

452
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:08,631
わお！
Whoa!

453
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,931
もしかしたら、最初にできることは...
Maybe the first thing we can do for that...

454
00:35:12,031 --> 00:35:15,631

That's right! How was that song earlier? Was I being sexy with Mococo-chan?

Do you wanna party together with us? ...Bau Bau!

709
00:52:47,476 --> 00:52:54,376
You know we had some of our Holo-Dog Senpai join us for Yocoso Jappari-party...

710
00:52:54,376 --> 00:52:59,676
...and then performed an extra silly version of Let's Go! Onmyoji!

711
00:53:00,976 --> 00:53:05,676
What was that with the bells and the microwave?!

712
00:53:05,676 --> 00:53:10,676
You know, that's the necessary part of Let's Go! Onmyoji, you know!

713
00:53:10,676 --> 00:53:12,976
I guess... extra silly!

714
00:53:13,376 --> 00:53:18,376
We're just so happy to have a bunch of our friends here with us for our birthday live today.

715
00:53:18,376 --> 00:53:21,176
It's been really special so far, huh?

716
00:53:21,176 --> 00:53:23,376
But! But! We're still not done!

717
00:53:23,376 --> 00:53:27,676
Fuwamoco-time is still going! You're not tired yet, Ruffians?

718
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:30,176
No? Not time, right?!

719
00:53:31,176 --> 00:53:36,676
Yeah! Wow, Ruffians!

720
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:41,176
You know, it's our special day today...

721
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:46,676
...but actually, we have something we'd like to surprise you with!

722
00:53:47,676 --> 00:53:51,176
Are you ready? Can we get a drum roll?

723
00:53:51,176 --> 00:53:56,676
Tadaa! Our birthday merchandise!

724
00:54:00,676 --> 00:54:08,176
Here we have a Fuwawa birthday set and a Mococo birthday set! Bau Bau!

725
00:54:08,676 --> 00:54:13,676
Well... this year's birthday merch is a little bit embarrassing.

726
00:54:14,676 --> 00:54:17,676
I sure it's gonna be okay, Fuwawa. It's gonna be okay.
I'm sure it's gonna be okay, Fuwawa. It's gonna be okay.

727
00:54:18,176 --> 00:54:24,176
I know a lot of Ruffians have been waiting for a long time for something like this, but...

728
00:54:26,676 --> 00:54:31,176
Press that! Tada! We have the definitive FUWAMOCO dakimakura cover!

729
00:54:35,176 --> 00:54:39,176
Finally, right?! You know, Ruffians! You know, right?!

730
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:45,176
You can't just have Fuwa on one side and me on the other, okay? That's not okay! Got it?!

731
00:54:47,676 --> 00:54:52,676
So that's why we have a Fuwawa version and a Mococo version!

732
00:54:53,176 --> 00:54:59,176
Of course, with beautiful illustrations... but I love them!

733
00:55:00,191 --> 00:55:04,691
イコモチ！イコモチ！ありがとう！Thank you!
Ikomochi! Ikomochi! Arigato! Thank you!

734
00:55:05,291 --> 00:55:09,491
Wow! This is the Fuwawa dakimakura.

735
00:55:09,691 --> 00:55:15,691
And here is the Mococo dakimakura. Bau bau!

736
00:55:16,191 --> 00:55:20,691
They're very big. Mococo-chan, Mococo-chan...

737
00:55:20,691 --> 00:55:25,691
Fuwawa-chan! Bau bau!

738
00:55:26,191 --> 00:55:30,191
They're for hugging.

739
00:55:30,391 --> 00:55:34,991
They're for hugging. Yes.

740
00:55:35,191 --> 00:55:41,691
But you know, even though they might be a little bit embarrassing...

741
00:55:41,991 --> 00:55:48,191
We hope that they can help you sleep soundly at night, you know?

742
00:55:48,191 --> 00:55:54,191
Bau bau! Bau bau!

743
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:59,991
And next, we have Fuwamoco keychain plushies!

744
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:04,691
Look how compact they are! Compact!

745
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:10,191
But now, Fuwamoco can go anywhere and everywhere along with you.

746
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:15,691
Attached to your bag, maybe your keys, maybe even in your car.

747
00:56:16,191 --> 00:56:21,191
No matter what, we'll be by your side. It's super cute!

748
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:28,191
And next, we have a very cute Fuwawa hairband and Mococo hairband.

749
00:56:28,391 --> 00:56:30,691
Maybe you're wondering, what exactly is this?

750
00:56:30,991 --> 00:56:37,191
Well, this way we can help keep back the fluff from your face when you wash your face at night.

751
00:56:37,691 --> 00:56:43,191
Or maybe you can just have fun with a quick Fuwamoco style disguise!

752
00:56:43,391 --> 00:56:45,191
It's up to you!

753
00:56:45,691 --> 00:56:52,191
And finally, we have some cute collectible button badges of dakimakura Fuwamoco.

754
00:56:52,391 --> 00:56:58,691
They're sparkly and holographic, and come in a super cute heart shape.

755
00:56:59,191 --> 00:57:04,691
It's perfect for any ita-bag, you know? Just bringing a bit more Fuwamoco to your belongings.

756
00:57:05,691 --> 00:57:11,191
But we also have something special as well, right Mococo-chan?

757
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:20,191
You know, what would help you get an even better rest at night, right?

758
00:57:20,391 --> 00:57:26,691
Maybe a soothing sleepover ASMR voice from us? There's a Fuwawa voice...

759
00:57:27,191 --> 00:57:32,691
...and a Mococo voice. But we hope that you'll listen to both of them right before bed.

760
00:57:38,391 --> 00:57:46,691
And finally, for those who purchase the entire set, we also have a special thank you bonus voice message as well.

761
00:57:47,191 --> 00:57:54,191
And of course, there are also special hand-signed limited edition sets that come with a polaroid style card.

762
00:57:54,691 --> 00:58:03,191
So cute! We really hope that you'll be able to get your paws on them as well, Ruffians!

763
00:58:04,191 --> 00:58:12,191
And as a full set bonus, you'll receive one card that can be used in the Hololive Official Card Game!

764
00:58:12,691 --> 00:58:22,191
Yeah, one card for Fuwawa's set, one card for Mococo's set. And this card is only available to those who purchase from the Hololive Production Official Shop.

765
00:58:22,391 --> 00:58:27,691
Okay, got it! Please look forward to it, okay? Bau bau!

766
00:58:30,191 --> 00:58:33,691
You know, after that very exciting announcement...

767
00:58:33,991 --> 00:58:38,691
...we still have one last song we'd like to sing for you today.

768
00:58:39,191 --> 00:58:46,691
Well, this next song is one that's really important to us, especially when we were still locked up back in the cell.

769
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:55,691
And now that we're finally a part of Hololive, and you know, we're even able to have our first ever birthday live...

770
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:59,191
...we'd like to sing it for you. Okay? Please listen, Kirameki Rider!

Can't we just have a quick bite? Huh?

01:11:24,716 --> 01:11:25,796
Wow!

921
01:11:26,796 --> 01:11:28,676
My tummy's all full now,

922
01:11:28,676 --> 01:11:30,436
so let's do our best, you know?

923
01:11:31,276 --> 01:11:33,716
I guess we do have some important stuff to talk about, huh?

924
01:11:33,716 --> 01:11:34,556
Yeah.

925
01:11:35,156 --> 01:11:36,396
Okay! Let's go!

926
01:11:36,396 --> 01:11:37,556
Woah!

927
01:11:43,996 --> 01:11:45,236
Ah, wait, Mococo!

928
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:47,556
I think there's some cream on your face.

929
01:11:48,036 --> 01:11:49,996
Right over here. Mm!

930
01:11:52,676 --> 01:11:54,876
Hey! You ate it, huh?!

931
01:11:54,876 --> 01:11:55,956
You know!

932
01:11:56,476 --> 01:11:57,956
It was yummy.

933
01:11:58,436 --> 01:12:00,836
Mococo, you still have cream on your face!

934
01:12:00,836 --> 01:12:01,676
Still!

935
01:12:02,396 --> 01:12:04,636
Ah, maybe just one more... let's just get it all!

936
01:12:04,636 --> 01:12:05,636
Okay!

937
01:12:11,396 --> 01:12:12,596
Ah, well, where was I?

938
01:12:13,036 --> 01:12:14,516
Ah, our birthday, huh?

939
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:16,036
Yeah!

940
01:12:16,356 --> 01:12:19,636
We're super happy to be able to share and perform

941
01:12:19,636 --> 01:12:21,556
some of my favorite songs with you today.

942
01:12:22,316 --> 01:12:25,556
As well as show lots of different sides of ourselves as idols.

943
01:12:26,396 --> 01:12:28,396
We've put all into our performance today, you know?

944
01:12:28,716 --> 01:12:31,076
Our fluff and our fights.

945
01:12:31,516 --> 01:12:34,236
Sweat and tears, but most importantly,

946
01:12:34,236 --> 01:12:35,556
so much of our love.

947
01:12:36,076 --> 01:12:39,156
So we hope they're able to shine just even a little bit.

948
01:12:39,556 --> 01:12:42,036
Well, we'll continue to do our best,

949
01:12:42,036 --> 01:12:44,476
so please continue to cheer lots for us, okay?

950
01:12:44,996 --> 01:12:48,116
We'll do our best to go into even stronger demon-guard dogs, yeah!

951
01:12:48,116 --> 01:12:50,276
To protect your smile, okay?

952
01:12:50,716 --> 01:12:52,076
Don't take your eyes off us!

953
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:53,236
Mm! You know!

954
01:12:53,596 --> 01:12:56,116
Fuwamoco, we'll continue to keep an eye on you too, okay?

955
01:12:56,116 --> 01:12:57,116
Yeah.

956
01:12:59,196 --> 01:13:00,836
Bau bau!

957
01:13:00,836 --> 01:13:02,116

958
01:13:02,116 --> 01:13:03,076

960
01:13:04,196 --> 01:13:04,836
Yeah!

961
01:13:05,356 --> 01:13:08,716
Well, with that, we'd like to go into our

962
01:13:08,716 --> 01:13:10,196
final final song for today. Final final.

963
01:13:10,756 --> 01:13:14,596
But before, for the Ruffians who are all part
of our membership, the Doggy Pack...

964
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:16,036
Have you joined? Uh...

965
01:13:16,396 --> 01:13:17,436
Yeah!

966
01:13:17,796 --> 01:13:21,316
Well, we still have a few more songs we'd like to sing

967
01:13:21,316 --> 01:13:23,996
from our hearts to yours. Yeah.

968
01:13:24,356 --> 01:13:26,796
You know, just a little heart to heart.

969
01:13:27,316 --> 01:13:30,076
So we hope... don't, don't run off,

970
01:13:30,076 --> 01:13:32,636
don't go anywhere after this, okay? Don't, don't go away, okay?

971
01:13:33,236 --> 01:13:35,796
Mm, there's just a little more we'd like to share with you. Yeah.

972
01:13:36,196 --> 01:13:37,316
Got it. Uh...

973
01:13:37,756 --> 01:13:40,556
Well, please wait a little while while we wipe off some of our sweat

974
01:13:40,556 --> 01:13:42,796
and fix ourselves up and fuzz a little, okay?

975
01:13:43,636 --> 01:13:46,716
But you know, in the meantime, maybe you can get your paws

976
01:13:46,716 --> 01:13:49,036
on some of our birthday merch as well! Birthday merch! Yeah.

977
01:13:49,436 --> 01:13:51,916
But really, thank you so much for being a Ruffian.

978
01:13:52,436 --> 01:13:54,916
Yeah. We'll continue to do our all.

979
01:13:57,676 --> 01:14:00,116
So let's continue on this bright journey together, okay?

980
01:14:00,116 --> 01:14:02,396
Uh... woah!

981
01:14:03,476 --> 01:14:06,236
Well, this last song is especially dear to us,

982
01:14:06,236 --> 01:14:09,036
and has kept us going when times have been tough too. Uh...

983
01:14:09,756 --> 01:14:12,836
We know and hope that you'll know we'll always be here for you,

984
01:14:12,836 --> 01:14:15,236
and that someone out there will be always waiting.

985
01:14:15,596 --> 01:14:17,596
So do your best, okay?

986
01:14:19,716 --> 01:14:22,236
Well then, please listen to our last song.

987
01:14:22,636 --> 01:14:24,636
