放て！
Fire!

5
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,300
心に刻んだ夢を
The dreams engraved in my heart

6
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,750
未来さえ置き去りにして
Leaving even the future behind

7
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,750
限界など知らない
Knowing no limits

8
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,000
意味無い
There's no point

9
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,150
この能力（ちから）が
This power...

10
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,000
光散らす
...scatters light

11
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:07,808
その先に遥かな想いを
With far-off feelings ahead

12
00:05:10,308 --> 00:05:15,908
歩いてきたこの道を振り返ることしか
If the only thing I can do is look back on the path I've walked...

13
00:05:16,408 --> 00:05:22,608
出来ないなら今ここで全てを壊せる
then I'll break everything right here and now.

14
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:29,008
暗闇に堕ちる街並み 人はどこまで立ち向かえるの？
Fallen cityscapes in the darkness; just how far can people stand against it?

15
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:36,408
加速するその痛みから誰かをきっと守れるよ
I'm sure I can protect someone from this accelerating pain.

16
00:05:37,308 --> 00:05:42,808
Looking! The blitz loop this planet to search my Only my railgun can shoot it.

17
00:05:43,308 --> 00:05:50,408
今すぐ身体中を光の速さで駆け巡った確かな予感
Right now, a definite premonition raced through my body at the speed of light.

18
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:57,508
掴め！望むものなら残さず輝ける自分らしさで
Seize it! If it's what you desire, you can shine by being yourself without leaving anything behind.

19
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:04,508
信じてるよあの日の誓いをこの瞳に光る涙
I believe in that day's vow, and the tears shining in these eyes...

20
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:09,808
それさえも強さになるから
even they will become my strength.

21
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:17,808
立ち止まると少しだけ感じる切なさに
In the faint sadness I feel when I come to a halt...

22
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:24,608
戸惑うことないなんて嘘はつかないよ
I won't lie and say I'm never bewildered.

23
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:31,408
宙に舞うコインが描く放物線が決める運命
The parabola drawn by a coin dancing in the air determines destiny.

24
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:38,108
打ち出した答えが今日も私の胸を駆け巡る
The answer I struck out races through my heart again today.

25
00:06:39,808 --> 00:06:44,908
Sparkling! The shiny lights awake true desire. Only my railgun can shoot it.

26
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:53,108
必ず貫いてく途惑うことなく傷ついても走り続ける
I'll always pierce through, without hesitation, continuing to run even if I get hurt.

27
00:06:54,008 --> 00:07:00,108
狙え！凛と煌めく視線は狂いなく闇を切り裂く
Aim! My dignified, sparkling gaze will slice through the darkness without error.

28
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:06,508
迷いなんて吹き飛ばせばいいこの心が叫ぶ限り
I should just blow away any hesitation as long as my heart screams out.

29
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:12,108
誰ひとり邪魔などさせない
I won't let anyone get in my way.

30
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:46,908
儚く舞う無数の願いはこの両手に積もってゆく
The countlessly dancing, fleeting wishes pile up in both my hands.

31
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:53,408
切り裂く闇に見えてくるのは重く深く切ない記憶
What I see through the cut-open darkness are heavy, deep, and painful memories.

32
00:07:53,908 --> 00:08:00,108
色褪せてゆく現実に揺れる絶望には負けたくない
I don't want to lose to the despair swaying in the fading reality.

33
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:06,808
私が今私であること胸を張って全て誇れる
That I am who I am right now—I can take pride in all of it.

34
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:13,408
Looking! The blitz loop this planet to search my Only my railgun can shoot it.

35
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:19,608
今すぐ身体中を光の速さで駆け巡った確かな予感
Right now, a definite premonition raced through my body at the speed of light.

36
00:08:20,508 --> 00:08:26,708
放て！心に刻んだ夢を未来さえ置き去りにして
Release it! Leave the future itself behind with the dream carved into your heart.

37
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:33,508
限界など知らない意味ないこの能力(ちから)が光散らす
Boundaries are unknown and meaningless; this power scatters light.

38
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:39,608
その先に遥かな想いを
With far-off feelings ahead

39
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:13,608
ギターと孤独と蒼い惑星
Guitars, Loneliness and Blue Planet

40
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:27,508
突然降る夕立 ああ傘もないや嫌
A sudden evening shower, ah, I don't even have an umbrella, how annoying.

41
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:31,208
空のご機嫌なんかしらない
I don't care about the sky's mood.

42
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:37,108
季節の変わり目の服は何着りゃいいんだろ
What should I wear during the change of seasons?

43
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:41,208
春と秋 どこいっちゃったんだよ
Spring and autumn, where did they go?

44
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:45,908
息もできない情報の圧力
The pressure of information that leaves me unable to breathe.

45
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:50,608
めまいの螺旋 私はどこにいる
A spiral of dizziness, where am I?

46
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:56,208
こんなに こんなに 息の音がするのに
Despite my breath sounding like this, so much...

47
00:09:57,108 --> 00:10:00,808
変だね 世界の音がしない
It's strange, I can't hear the sounds of the world.

48
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:05,496
足りない　足りない
Not enough, not enough

49
00:10:05,696 --> 00:10:07,496
誰にも気づかれない
Not noticed by anyone

50
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:09,496
殴り書きみたいな音
Sounds like scribbling

51
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:12,096
出せない状態で叫んだよ
I screamed in a state where I couldn't get it out

52
00:10:12,796 --> 00:10:14,796
ありのままなんて
Things as they are...

53
00:10:14,996 --> 00:10:17,096
誰に見せるんだ
Who am I going to show?

54
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:21,096
馬鹿な私は歌うだけ
Stupid me, I just sing

55
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:24,796
ぶちまけちゃおうか　星に
Shall I spill it all out to the stars?

56
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:41,096
エリクサーに張り替える作業も　なんとなくなんだ
Even the task of restringing with Elixirs is just half-hearted

57
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:45,796
欠けた爪を少し触る
I touch my chipped nail slightly

58
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:51,096
半径300mmの体で必死に鳴いてる
Crying out desperately with a body of 300mm radius

59
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:55,996
音楽に酔っちゃえば　ココが地球だな
If I get drunk on music, then this is Earth

60
00:10:56,796 --> 00:11:00,796
空気を握って　空を殴るよ
Grabbing the air and punching the sky

61
00:11:01,696 --> 00:11:05,796
何も起きない　私は無能さ
Nothing happens, I'm incompetent

62
00:11:06,696 --> 00:11:10,696
だけどさその手で　この鉄を弾いたら
But if I pluck these iron strings with that hand

63
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:15,596
何かが変わって見えた
Something seemed to change

64
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:21,596
よう眩しい眩しい　そんなに光るなよ
How dazzling, dazzling, don't shine so much

65
00:11:22,596 --> 00:11:26,796
私のダサい影が　より濃くなってしまうだろう
My lame shadow will only grow darker

66
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,796
なんでこんなに熱くなっちゃってんだ　止まんない
Why have I become so hot? I can't stop

67
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:36,596
馬鹿な私は歌うだけ
Stupid me, I just sing

68
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,796
うるさいんだって心臓
My heart is so loud

69
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:53,796
蒼い惑星　独りぼっち
Blue planet, all alone

70
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:58,796
いっぱいの音を聴いてきた
I've heard so many sounds

71
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:03,896
回り続けて幾億年
Continuing to spin for billions of years

72
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:09,096
一瞬でもいいから　ああ
Even just for a moment, ah...

73
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,096
聴いて　聴けよ
Listen, listen!

74
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:16,596
わたし　わたし　わたしはここにいる
I, I, I am right here

75
00:12:17,096 --> 00:12:21,096
殴り書きみたいな音　出せない状態で叫んだよ
I screamed in a state where I couldn't get out these scribbled-like sounds

76
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:25,796
何かになりたい　なりたい　何者かでいい
I want to be something, I want to be something, anyone will do

77
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:31,096
馬鹿な私は歌うだけ
Stupid me, I just sing

78
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:34,796
ぶちまけちゃおうか　星に
Shall I spill it all out to the stars?

79
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:08,596
歌聞いてくれてありがとう！
Thanks for listening to my song!

80
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:15,596
聞いてくれるこの環境、とっても嬉しく思います！
I'm so happy to have this environment where people listen to me!

81
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:20,096
いやー、『ギターと孤独と蒼い惑星』もね、もうかなり難しくて、
Man, "Guitars and Solitude and the Blue Planet" was really difficult,

82
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:24,096
練習頑張ったんで、どうだったかな？
and I worked hard on practicing it, so I wonder how it was?

83
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:28,096
よかった？嬉しいよー！
Was it good? I'm so happy!

84
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:35,096
あ、ホロライブ4期生、角巻わためです！
Ah, I'm Tsunomaki Watame of Hololive Gen 4!

85
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:38,596
これ見よがしに弾いております！
I'm playing this ostentatiously!

86
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:43,096
今日でなんと、9歳になりました！
And today, I turned 9 years old!

87
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:46,596
お祝いっぱいありがとう！
Thank you for all the celebrations!

88
00:13:47,096 --> 00:13:50,596
ありがとうございます、ありがとうございます。
Thank you so much, thank you so much.

89
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:54,596
いや、この日のために、もうたくさん、たくさん頑張って準備もしてきたので。
Man, I've worked so hard and prepared so much for this day.

90
00:13:55,596 --> 00:13:59,096
ぜひ最後まで、見て楽しんでほしいなと思います！
So I hope you'll watch and enjoy until the very end!

91
00:14:00,096 --> 00:14:02,096
よろしくべいべー！
Rock on, baby!

92
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:05,096
ということでね、これはあの、片付けますね。
And with that, I'm going to put this away.

93
00:14:05,096 --> 00:14:07,596
もう使わないのでね。
I won't be using it anymore.

94
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:11,096
はい、ちょっと待っててね。よいしょ、よいしょ。
Okay, wait a bit. Heave-ho, heave-ho.

95
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:14,596
よいしょっと。このギターが、ギターが...
There we go. This guitar, the guitar...

96
00:14:14,596 --> 00:14:17,096
よいしょ、よいしょ。
Heave-ho, heave-ho.

97
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,596
肩凝りになっちまう。
I'm going to get stiff shoulders.

98
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:30,096
やー待っててくれてありがとう。ございます。
Thanks for waiting. Thank you.

99
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:34,596
今日のハッシュタグは！なんと！前代未聞！

I'd be so happy if you could use this hashtag and post a ton!

102
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:52,096
今日はアニソンナイトフィーバー、楽しんでいけますかー！
Can we enjoy Anime Song Night Fever today?!

103
00:14:52,596 --> 00:14:54,596
いけますかー！
Can we?!

104
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:58,596
わためは、いけます！
Watame is ready!

105
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:02,596
では、アニソンナイトフィーバー、行くぞー！
Then, Anime Song Night Fever, let's go!

106
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:06,377
ん？
Hm?

107
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:07,879
何だこれは？
What is this?

108
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:12,317
こんなのステージに置いてあったら いけないでしょ
You can't have things like this just lying on the stage.

109
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:13,852
つぎに...
Next...

110
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:15,477
なにこれ？
What is this?

111
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:17,121
あ、何なの？
Oh, what is it?

112
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:18,889
誰 これ置いたの？
Who put this here?

113
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:20,077
あ...
Oh...

114
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:22,994
なんじゃこりゃ！
What the heck is this?!

115
00:15:29,868 --> 00:15:32,977
渇いた叫び
Kawaita Sakebi

116
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:35,977
作詞・作曲：小松未歩
Lyrics/Composition: Miho Komatsu

117
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:50,122
このままもう少し歩こう 肩を抱き
Let's walk just a bit further like this, arm in arm

118
00:15:50,122 --> 00:15:55,060
消えゆく夢を数え枯れてく仲間を見た
I watched friends wither as they counted their fading dreams

119
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:08,006
通い慣れた道に迷い込むこのごろ
Lately, I've been getting lost on familiar paths

120
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:18,783
闇がもう一人の自分をつくる
The darkness creates another version of myself

121
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:24,389
渇いた叫びがくじけそうな
A parched shout pierces through

122
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:28,059
胸を突き刺す
my disheartened chest

123
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:33,031
君を誘って世界を見たいな
I want to invite you along to see the world

124
00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:40,305
だれにも出せない答えが
The answer no one else can give

125
00:16:40,305 --> 00:16:44,676
僕の中にある
lies within me

126
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:47,979
駆け引きがカギ
The bargaining is the key

127
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:53,318
とどけ fly at higher game
Reach out, fly at higher game

128
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:08,520
いくつの悲しみを一緒に越えただろう？
I wonder how many sorrows we've overcome together?

129
00:17:12,391 --> 00:17:16,228
気が済むまで求めたあの日の僕達がいた
We were there that day, searching until satisfied

130
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:24,640
時代が巡るなら またどこかで会えるね
If the times come around, we'll meet again somewhere

131
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:36,318
その時が来るまで諦めない
I won't give up until that time comes

132
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,490
冷めてく想いは どうしても否めないけど
Though I can't deny my feelings are cooling down

133
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:51,433
恋に落ちて変わってくのもいいね
It's also nice to fall in love and change

134
00:17:53,568 --> 00:17:58,307
焦らず騒がずあるがままでと願うから
I wish to stay as I am, without rushing or fussing

135
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:05,647
心に花を
Let a flower in our hearts

136
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:11,253
咲かそう just take my heart
bloom; just take my heart

137
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:41,693
渇いた叫びがくじけそうな
A parched shout pierces through

138
00:18:41,693 --> 00:18:45,188
胸を突き刺す
my disheartened chest

139
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:50,362
君を誘って世界を見たいな
I want to invite you along to see the world

140
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:57,933
だれにも出せない答えが
The answer no one else can give

141
00:18:57,933 --> 00:19:02,340
夢の中にある
lies within my dreams

142
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:07,145
僕を信じて
Believe in me

143
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:10,782
咲かそう just take my heart
Let it bloom; just take my heart

144
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:17,689
人生は続いてく
Life goes on

145
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:22,192
カサブタ
作詞・作曲：千綿偉功
Kasabuta
Lyrics/Composition: Chiwata Hidenori

146
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:26,892
明日へ続く坂道の途中で
Halfway up the slope that leads to tomorrow

147
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:32,492
すれ違う大人たちはつぶやくのさ
The adults passing by whisper to themselves

148
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:38,392
愛とか夢とか理想も解るけど
I understand things like love, dreams, and ideals

149
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:44,392
目の前の現実はそんなに甘くないって
But they say reality isn't that sweet

150
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:47,492
つまずきながらも
Though we stumble

151
00:20:47,592 --> 00:20:50,192
転がりながらも
Though we roll along

152
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:54,792
カサブタだらけの情熱を忘れたくない
I don't want to forget this passion covered in scabs

153
00:20:56,392 --> 00:21:01,092
大人になれない僕らの 強がりをひとつ聞いてくれ
Listen to one show of strength from us who can't grow up

154
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:04,392
逃げも隠れもしないから
We won't run or hide

155
00:21:04,492 --> 00:21:07,592
笑いたい奴だけ笑え
So those who want to laugh can laugh

156
00:21:07,992 --> 00:21:12,592
せめて頼りない僕らの 自由の芽を摘み取らないで
At least don't pluck the sprouts of freedom from us who are unreliable

157
00:21:13,092 --> 00:21:17,992
水をあげるその役目を 果たせばいいんだろう？
It's fine as long as we fulfill the role of watering them, right?

158
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:27,592
何度も繰り返した失敗とか
The failures we've repeated over and over

159
00:21:28,692 --> 00:21:32,792
大きく食い違った考えとか
The ideas that were so far apart

160
00:21:34,492 --> 00:21:38,792
僕らの基準はとても不確かで
Our standards are so uncertain

161
00:21:39,692 --> 00:21:44,592
昨日より何となく歩幅が広くなった
Somehow my stride feels wider than yesterday

162
00:21:45,092 --> 00:21:47,692
背伸びをしながら
While stretching ourselves thin

163
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:50,292
打ちのめされながら
While being beaten down

164
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:54,792
カサブタをちょっとはがすけど 答えは出ない
I peel off a scab a bit, but there's no answer

165
00:21:56,392 --> 00:22:01,192
大人になりたい僕らの わがままをひとつ聞いてくれ
Listen to one selfish wish from us who want to grow up

166
00:22:01,992 --> 00:22:04,692
寝ても覚めても縛られる
Bound whether asleep or awake

167
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:07,492
時間を少しだけ止めて
Just stop time for a little while

168
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:12,592
せめてふがいない僕らの 自由の実を切り取らないで
At least don't cut off the fruits of freedom from us who are pathetic

169
00:22:13,092 --> 00:22:17,992
赤く熟すその時まで 悩めばいいんだろう
It's fine as long as we worry until they ripen red

170
00:22:41,092 --> 00:22:46,092
大人になれない僕らの 強がりをひとつ聞いてくれ
Listen to one show of strength from us who can't grow up

171
00:22:46,592 --> 00:22:49,392
逃げも隠れもしないから
We won't run or hide

172
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:52,492
笑いたい奴だけ笑え
So those who want to laugh can laugh

173
00:22:52,892 --> 00:22:57,492
せめて頼りない僕らの 自由の芽を摘み取らないで
At least don't pluck the sprouts of freedom from us who are unreliable

174
00:22:57,992 --> 00:23:02,592
水をあげるその役目を 果たせばいいんだろう
It's fine as long as we fulfill the role of watering them, right?

175
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:41,192
Catch You Catch Me
作詞・作曲：広瀬香美
Catch You Catch Me
Lyrics/Composition: Kohmi Hirose

176
00:23:42,692 --> 00:23:45,492
会いたいな
I want to see you

177
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,792
会えないな
I can't see you

178
00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:50,492
切ないな この気持ち
It's painful, this feeling

179
00:23:50,992 --> 00:23:53,492
言えないな
I can't say it

180
00:23:53,592 --> 00:23:55,492
言いたいな
I want to say it

181
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:57,792
チャンス 逃してばかり
I keep missing every chance

182
00:23:58,392 --> 00:24:01,992
だって だって だって
Because, because, because

183
00:24:02,592 --> 00:24:05,592
翼広げ二人で
Spreading our wings together

184
00:24:05,992 --> 00:24:08,992
空をマラソン
Marathon through the sky

185
00:24:09,092 --> 00:24:12,192
夢をユニゾンしたい
I want our dreams in unison

186
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:16,592
ほら Catch You Catch You Catch Me Catch Me 待って
See? Catch you, catch you, catch me, catch me... wait

187
00:24:17,092 --> 00:24:19,092
こっちを向いて
Look my way

188
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:20,792
スキだといって
Tell me you love me

189
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:24,192
そう Nice to Meet You Good to See You きっと
That's right, nice to meet you, good to see you, surely

190
00:24:24,592 --> 00:24:32,092
私の想い あなたのハートに 飛んで飛んで飛んで行け
Let my feelings fly, fly, fly into your heart

191
00:24:32,592 --> 00:24:35,192
迷わない
I won't hesitate

192
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:50,292
たまにね 無くなっちゃう
Sometimes it just runs out

193
00:24:50,392 --> 00:24:53,792
身体のバッテリー
The body's battery

194
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,292
あなたの笑顔で いつも充電満タン
Your smile always gives me a full charge

195
00:24:57,392 --> 00:25:00,192
パワー全開
Power at full blast

196
00:25:00,307 --> 00:25:01,607
パワー爆発しちゃう
My power is about to explode

197
00:25:02,307 --> 00:25:05,607
お願い お願い お願い お願い
Please, please, please, please

198
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:09,407
まだねお友達かな
Are we still just friends?

199
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:13,707
笑って見つめて楽しい毎日にしたい
I want to smile and look at you, and make every day fun

200
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:20,707
ほら Catch You Catch You Catch Me Catch Me ゼッタイ
Look, I'll definitely Catch You Catch Me

201
00:25:20,907 --> 00:25:24,507
運命だって お似合いだって そう
Because it's fate, because we're a perfect match, yes

202
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:28,407
Nice to Meet You Good to See You きっと
Nice to meet you, good to see you, surely

203
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:32,407
誰にも負けない あなたに世界で一番
I won't lose to anyone, to you, the most in the world

204
00:25:33,707 --> 00:25:36,807
コ・イ・シ・テ・ル
I'm in love with you

205
00:27:18,807 --> 00:27:22,307
また夢から覚める 濡れた瞼を開ける
Waking from a dream again, opening my wet eyelids

206
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:26,007
狂おしいほど思い残す 遠い日の無力を呪う
Left with regrets so intense it's maddening, cursing the helplessness of distant days

207
00:27:26,307 --> 00:27:29,707
身を焼かれるような絶望も糧にはなろうか
Will even the despair that feels like it's burning my body become nourishment?

208
00:27:29,907 --> 00:27:31,307
憧れに焦がれるまま燃やし続けている
Continuing to burn while longing for my aspirations

209
00:27:31,507 --> 00:27:34,907
キラキラな星様したあなたのeyes
Your eyes, like twinkling stars

210
00:27:35,107 --> 00:27:37,607
カラカラ渇いて可哀想なlack of 愛？
Parched and pitiful, a lack of love?

211
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:41,107
全てを孤独から救う眩しい光
A dazzling light that saves everything from loneliness

212
00:27:41,307 --> 00:27:44,507
僕にだけ落ちる shadow はあなたのせい？
Is the shadow falling only on me your fault?

213
00:27:44,707 --> 00:27:46,607
致命的な欠落をくれたね
You gave me a fatal deficiency

214
00:27:46,807 --> 00:27:49,307
身勝手な巨星 狂わされた生
A selfish giant star, a life driven mad

215
00:27:50,307 --> 00:27:53,307
お願い、声を聞かせて、声を聞かせて
Please, let me hear your voice, let me hear your voice

216
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:56,007
絡まって歪んでしまった僕らに
To us, who have become entangled and distorted

217
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,307
くれたのはあなただけ、あなただけ
The one who gave it was only you, only you

218
00:27:59,507 --> 00:28:02,107
(ああ、あなただけ、あなただけ)
(Ah, only you, only you)

219
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:05,707
お願い、僕を見ていて、僕を見ていて
Please, keep looking at me, keep looking at me

220
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:09,107
宿命に刻まれた痛みさえ武器にして
Turning even the pain carved into destiny into a weapon

221
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:12,607
いつかの後悔すら照らせるように
So that even someday's regrets can be illuminated

222
00:28:14,807 --> 00:28:18,107
あなたがいないと生きていけない
I can't live without you

223
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:21,507
何もかも捧げてしまっていい
It's fine to sacrifice everything

224
00:28:21,707 --> 00:28:24,107
あなたの愛がまだ足りない
Your love is still not enough

225
00:28:24,307 --> 00:28:26,807
欠けたものは何で埋めたらいい？
What should I fill the missing pieces with?

226
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:30,107
致命的、致命的、致命的な愛
Fatal, fatal, fatal love

227
00:28:30,307 --> 00:28:33,107
運命的、運命的、運命的な愛
Fateful, fateful, fateful love

228
00:28:33,307 --> 00:28:36,107
必然的、必然的、必然的な哀
Inevitable, inevitable, inevitable sorrow

229
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:37,607
僕を見ていてね
Keep looking at me

230
00:28:37,807 --> 00:28:39,807
最愛のファタール！
My dearest Fatale!

231
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:54,707
キラキラな星様したあなたのeyes
Your eyes, like twinkling stars

232
00:28:54,907 --> 00:28:57,407
カラカラ渇いて可哀想なlack of 愛？
Parched and pitiful, a lack of love?

233
00:28:57,607 --> 00:29:00,807
遥か彼方から放たれた美しさに
At the beauty emitted from far, far away

234
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:04,207
灼かれた眼、捥がれた羽、創造的堕天
Burned eyes, torn wings, a creative fall from grace

235
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:06,807
あらゆる視界をジャック その輝きはエゴイスティック
Hijacking all fields of vision, that brilliance is egoistic

236
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:09,407
胸の奥仕舞った感傷さえ引っ張り出して昇華して
Pulling out even the sentimentality hidden deep in my heart and sublimating it

237
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:15,807
僕という運命を全部抱きしめてゆく
I'll embrace all of the destiny that is me

238
00:29:16,707 --> 00:29:19,707
あなたがいないと生きていけない
I can't live without you

239
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:22,707
眩しさでこの身を照らして欲しい
I want you to illuminate this body with brilliance

240
00:29:22,907 --> 00:29:25,307
あなたの愛がまだ足りない
Your love is still not enough

241
00:29:25,507 --> 00:29:28,007
夢の中で貰うしかないのに
Even though I can only receive it in a dream

242
00:29:28,307 --> 00:29:31,107
致命的、致命的、致命的な愛
Fatal, fatal, fatal love

243
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:34,107
運命的、運命前、運命的な愛
Fateful, fateful, fateful love

244
00:29:34,307 --> 00:29:37,107
必然的、必然的、必然的な哀
Inevitable, inevitable, inevitable sorrow

245
00:29:37,307 --> 00:29:39,807
誰のものでもない 最愛のファタール！
Belonging to no one, my dearest Fatale!

246
00:29:41,807 --> 00:29:44,507
何度悔やんだだろう 何度呪っただろう
How many times have I regretted it? How many times have I cursed it?

247
00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:49,307
どれほどの幸福を注いだとしても
No matter how much happiness I pour in

248
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:53,307
満たされることのない器
A vessel that can never be filled

249
00:29:54,307 --> 00:29:56,807
何度夢見ただろう 何度願っただろう
How many times have I dreamed of it? How many times have I wished for it?

250
00:29:57,307 --> 00:30:01,707
僕の胸で膿み続けている傷を撫でる手を
For a hand to stroke the wound that continues to fester in my chest

251
00:30:02,762 --> 00:30:04,892
僕の胸で震え続けている傷を撫でる手を
With a hand that strokes the wound still trembling in my chest

252
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:08,182
この舞台で足掻くことをやめない
I won't stop struggling on this stage

253
00:30:08,662 --> 00:30:11,282
ただ一つのアイに近づきたい
I want to get closer to that one and only "Ai"

254
00:30:11,662 --> 00:30:14,212
固く定まったこの宿命
This destiny that has been firmly decided

255
00:30:14,662 --> 00:30:17,242
あの星の光からこぼれた闇
The darkness that spilled from the light of that star

256
00:30:17,662 --> 00:30:20,282
あなたがいないと生きていけない
I can't live without you

257
00:30:20,662 --> 00:30:23,282
何もかも捧げてしまっていい
I'm fine with giving up everything

258
00:30:23,662 --> 00:30:26,282
あなたの愛がまだ足りない
Your love is still not enough

259
00:30:26,662 --> 00:30:29,262
欠けたものは何で埋めたらいい？
What should I use to fill what's missing?

260
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:32,582
致命的、致命的、致命的な愛
Fatal, fatal, fatal love

261
00:30:32,962 --> 00:30:35,312
運命的、運命的、運命的な愛
Fated, fated, fated love

262
00:30:35,862 --> 00:30:38,512
必然的、必然的、必然的な愛
Inevitable, inevitable, inevitable love

263
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,582
僕を見ていてね
Keep your eyes on me

264
00:30:40,962 --> 00:30:43,262
最愛のファタール！
My beloved fatal!

265
00:30:48,062 --> 00:30:49,362
You're fatal

266
00:30:52,562 --> 00:30:55,262
最愛のファタール
My beloved fatal

267
00:31:08,162 --> 00:31:10,262
まるで御伽の話
Like a fairy tale

268
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:13,262
終わり迎えた証
The sign that it has ended

269
00:31:13,662 --> 00:31:16,262
長過ぎる旅路から
From the journey that was too long

270
00:31:16,662 --> 00:31:17,612
切り出した一節
A single verse cut out

271
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:20,242
それはかつてこの地に
It was once in this land

272
00:31:20,662 --> 00:31:23,262
影を落とした悪を
The evil that cast a shadow

273
00:31:23,662 --> 00:31:26,012
討ち取りし勇者との
With the hero who struck it down

274
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:27,362
短い旅の記憶
Memories of a short journey

275
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,912
物語は終わり
The story ends

276
00:31:39,262 --> 00:31:41,512
勇者は眠りにつく
The hero falls into slumber

277
00:31:41,662 --> 00:31:45,762
穏やかな日常を　この地に残して
Leaving a peaceful daily life in this land

278
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:50,062
時の流れは無情に　人を忘れさせる
The passage of time heartlessly makes people forget

279
00:31:50,512 --> 00:31:55,162
そこに生きた軌跡も　錆び付いていく
Even the traces of living there begin to rust

280
00:31:55,612 --> 00:31:59,262
それでも君の　言葉も願いも勇気も
Even so, your words, your wishes, and your courage

281
00:31:59,612 --> 00:32:03,762
今も確かに　私の中で生きてる
Are still certainly alive within me

282
00:32:06,212 --> 00:32:08,912
同じ道を選んだ
We chose the same path

283
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:11,262
それだけだったはずなのに
That was all it was supposed to be, and yet

284
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:13,862
いつからかどうして
Since when and why

285
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:17,762
頬を伝う涙の理由を
The reason for the tears streaming down my cheeks

286
00:32:18,112 --> 00:32:20,062
もっと知りたいんだ
I want to know more about it

287
00:32:20,462 --> 00:32:24,262
今更だって　共に歩んだ旅路を辿れば
Even if it's too late, if I retrace the journey we walked together

288
00:32:24,612 --> 00:32:29,262
そこに君はいなくとも　きっと見つけられる
Even if you're not there, I'll surely be able to find it

289
00:32:34,862 --> 00:32:37,262
物語は続く
The story continues

290
00:32:37,562 --> 00:32:39,262
一人の旅へと発つ
Setting off on a journey alone

291
00:32:39,612 --> 00:32:43,562
立ち寄る街で出会う人の
In the people I meet in the towns I stop at

292
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:48,062
記憶の中に残る君は
You, who remains in their memories

293
00:32:48,462 --> 00:32:50,762
相も変わらずお人好しで
Are as much of a softie as ever

294
00:32:51,112 --> 00:32:53,262
格好つけてばかりだね
And just always trying to look cool, aren't you?

295
00:32:53,762 --> 00:32:57,262
あちらこちらに作ったシンボルは
The symbols you made here and there

296
00:32:57,612 --> 00:32:59,762
勝ち取った平和の証
Are the proof of the peace you won

297
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:02,962
それすら未来でいつか
So that even in the future someday

298
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:05,762
私が一人にならないように
I won't be alone

299
00:33:06,212 --> 00:33:09,762
あの旅を思い出せるように
So that I can remember that journey

300
00:33:10,212 --> 00:33:12,962
残された目印
A mark left behind

301
00:33:21,762 --> 00:33:24,762
まるで御伽の話
Like a fairy tale

302
00:33:25,062 --> 00:33:27,762
終わり迎えた証
The sign that it has ended

303
00:33:28,162 --> 00:33:30,562
私を変えた出会い
The encounter that changed me

304
00:33:30,912 --> 00:33:33,262
百分の一の旅路
One-hundredth of a journey

305
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,762
君の勇気をいつか　風がさらって
Even if the wind carries away your courage someday

306
00:33:37,112 --> 00:33:41,762
誰の記憶から消えてしまっても
And it disappears from everyone's memory

307
00:33:42,162 --> 00:33:45,262
私が未来に連れて行くから
I will take it with me into the future

308
00:33:45,662 --> 00:33:47,862
君の手を取った
I took your hand

309
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:50,262
あの日全て始まった
Everything started that day

310
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:54,262
くだらなくて思わずふっと
So silly that I can't help but

311
00:33:54,612 --> 00:33:56,762
笑ってしまうような
Suddenly burst out laughing

312
00:33:57,162 --> 00:34:00,262
ありふれた時間が　今も眩しい
That commonplace time is still dazzling even now

313
00:34:00,762 --> 00:34:03,262
知りたいんだ
I want to know

314
00:34:03,612 --> 00:34:06,262
今更だって振り返ると
Even if it's too late, looking back

315
00:34:06,662 --> 00:34:09,262
そこにはいつでも
There you always are

316
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:13,262
優しく微笑みかける君がいるから
Smiling gently at me

317
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:25,262
新たな旅の始まりは
The beginning of a new journey is

318
00:34:25,662 --> 00:34:29,262
君が守り抜いたこの地に
In this land that you protected to the end

319
00:34:29,662 --> 00:34:32,762
芽吹いた命と共に
Together with the life that has sprouted

320
00:34:49,762 --> 00:34:52,562
勇者、いい曲だったね〜。
"The Brave," that was a great song, wasn't it?

321
00:34:52,762 --> 00:34:54,262
うん。
Yeah.

322
00:34:54,562 --> 00:34:57,262
VJとかもね、あ、VJっていうのは
Even the VJ... Oh, by VJ

323
00:34:57,362 --> 00:35:00,062
この後ろのMVのことなんだけど。
I mean the MV behind me.

324
00:35:00,262 --> 00:35:02,562
VJとかもね、こだわってみたので、
Since I was really particular about the VJ as well,

325
00:35:02,762 --> 00:35:06,262
ぜひぜひ、いっぱい見てもらいたいな。
I'd really, really love for you all to watch it a lot.

326
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,262
アーカイブとかもね。
In the archives and such.

327
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:10,962
あ、まだ終わってないけどね！

なんかさ、今までのセトリさ、
You know, the setlist so far,

332
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,562
あの、平成の...

333
00:35:00,143 --> 00:35:04,743
...とか、まあ令和のアニソンとかを盛り込んでみたんだけど、知ってる曲はありましたか？

334
00:35:07,043 --> 00:35:09,743
お気に入りの曲とかあったかな？
Did you find any favorites?

335
00:35:10,643 --> 00:35:15,143
なんか好きな曲とか、もし見つかったりしたら、
If you found any songs you liked...

But! That's not all!

340
00:35:29,143 --> 00:35:31,343
一曲だけ、まあこの後、
Just one more song after this...

341
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:35,143
ちょっとゲームの曲とかもなんか混ざってんだけど、
...it's mixed with some game songs, but...

342
00:35:35,643 --> 00:35:40,143
あの、コンセプトがあるセトリになってます。この後。
...the setlist has a concept from here on.

I've always cleared the hurdles I couldn't jump over with a spirit that wouldn't lose, but...

Without knowing

434
00:45:56,713 --> 00:45:59,143
走り出した
I've started running

435
00:45:59,143 --> 00:46:01,643
想いが今でも
With feelings that, even now

436
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:04,473
この胸を確かに
Are surely beating

437
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:07,473
叩いてるから
Within this chest

438
00:46:07,813 --> 00:46:10,243
今日の僕が
Today's "me" will

439
00:46:10,243 --> 00:46:12,643
その先に続く
Build a tomorrow

440
00:46:13,113 --> 00:46:15,743
僕らなりの
In our own way

441
00:46:15,743 --> 00:46:18,213
明日を築いていく
That continues on ahead

442
00:46:18,413 --> 00:46:21,243
答えはそう
The answer, yes

443
00:46:21,243 --> 00:46:24,913
いつもここにある
Is always right here

444
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:39,143
過ぎた季節を
I don't have time

445
00:46:39,143 --> 00:46:41,643
嘆く暇はない
To lament the seasons gone by

446
00:46:41,943 --> 00:46:44,473
二度と迷って
So that I won't get lost

447
00:46:44,473 --> 00:46:47,473
しまわぬように
Ever again

448
00:46:47,813 --> 00:46:50,273
数えきれない
The countless

449
00:46:50,273 --> 00:46:52,773
ほんのささやかな
Tiny regrets

450
00:46:53,113 --> 00:46:55,643
そんな後悔
I held them

451
00:46:55,643 --> 00:46:58,213
抱えたまま
Close to me

452
00:46:58,543 --> 00:47:00,973
その背中だけ追いかけて
Chasing only after your back

453
00:47:00,973 --> 00:47:03,473
ここまで来たんだ
I've come this far

454
00:47:03,773 --> 00:47:06,273
探していた
I've found something

455
00:47:06,273 --> 00:47:08,973
僕だけにできること
That only I can do

456
00:47:09,513 --> 00:47:11,943
あの日くれた
The words you gave me

457
00:47:11,943 --> 00:47:14,473
言葉が今でも
That day are still

458
00:47:14,643 --> 00:47:17,113
この胸に確かに
Surely reaching

459
00:47:17,113 --> 00:47:20,273
届いてるから
Into my heart

460
00:47:20,613 --> 00:47:23,043
昨日よりも
More than yesterday

461
00:47:23,043 --> 00:47:25,473
今日僕は僕の
Today I'm realizing

462
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:28,443
生まれてきた
The reason

463
00:47:28,443 --> 00:47:31,273
理由に気付いていく
That I was born

464
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:34,243
答えはそう
The answer, yes

465
00:47:34,243 --> 00:47:37,913
いつもここにある
Is always right here

466
00:47:48,113 --> 00:47:51,613
ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

467
00:47:53,513 --> 00:47:55,413
だいぶ楽しいねー！
This is so much fun!

468
00:47:57,113 --> 00:48:00,113
ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！ハイ！
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

469
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:00,913
もっとー！
More!

470
00:48:05,113 --> 00:48:07,613
みんなありがとー！
Thank you everyone!

471
00:48:14,573 --> 00:48:16,943
全てがまるで
Everything was as if

472
00:48:16,943 --> 00:48:20,913
当たり前みたいだった
It were only natural

473
00:48:21,243 --> 00:48:23,773
尊い日々は
The precious days

474
00:48:23,773 --> 00:48:26,343
まだ終わらない
Have not ended yet

475
00:48:26,673 --> 00:48:31,273
そしてまた
And then again

476
00:48:33,113 --> 00:48:35,513
走り出した
I've started running

477
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:38,013
想いが今でも
With feelings that, even now

478
00:48:38,213 --> 00:48:40,773
この胸を確かに
Are surely beating

479
00:48:40,773 --> 00:48:43,773
叩いてるから
Within this chest

480
00:48:44,013 --> 00:48:46,473
今日の僕が
Today's "me" will

481
00:48:46,473 --> 00:48:48,943
その先に続く
Build a tomorrow

482
00:48:49,373 --> 00:48:51,973
僕らなりの
In our own way

483
00:48:51,973 --> 00:48:54,473
明日を築いていく
That continues on ahead

484
00:48:54,673 --> 00:48:57,473
答えはそう
The answer, yes

485
00:48:57,473 --> 00:49:01,413
いつもここにある
Is always right here

486
00:49:30,313 --> 00:49:32,113
みんなー！
Everyone!

487
00:49:32,513 --> 00:49:36,313
ギリワルのロボ、かっこよかったー！
The Giriwaru robot was so cool!

488
00:49:36,713 --> 00:49:40,213
ロボット、乗って飛んじゃったよー！
I rode the robot and flew!

489
00:49:40,913 --> 00:49:44,313
すごい！かっこよかったよねー！
Amazing! It was cool, right?

490
00:49:44,713 --> 00:49:49,113
いや、この3曲はロボットの曲をテーマに
Well, these three songs...

491
00:49:49,113 --> 00:49:52,913
歌って躍らせていただきましたー！
...were performed with a robot theme!

492
00:49:53,413 --> 00:49:56,413
さらにゲストもね、たくさん出演してくれて
And many guests appeared...

493
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:59,613
本当にありがとー！嬉しい！
...thank you so much! I'm so happy!

494
00:50:00,714 --> 00:50:02,354
はーい！ありがとうございました！感謝です！
Hi! Thank you so much! I'm grateful!

495
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:05,674
あ、そういえば、ころころ、ころころ、みんな気づいたかな？
Ah, by the way, did everyone notice the rolling?

496
00:50:06,474 --> 00:50:09,314
ころころ最初から実はそうだったんだけど、あの小顔ローラーがんばりまして
I've actually been doing it since the beginning,
but I worked hard with that face roller.

497
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:13,634
実はわため、小顔になったんですよね、こう見えて
Believe it or not, Watame's face actually got smaller.

498
00:50:14,474 --> 00:50:18,634
もうあれだね、顔デカって言われなくなっちゃうな、みんなめんごめんご
Now I won't be called "big face" anymore.
Sorry about that, everyone!

499
00:50:20,314 --> 00:50:22,754
そんな変わってないって、言わない！言わない！
Don't say it hasn't changed! Don't! Don't!

500
00:50:22,874 --> 00:50:24,634
ちゃんとちっちゃくなったんだ！
It definitely got smaller!

501
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:28,674
あ、このあとね、メン限3Dライブも10時15分からわためチャンネルでやりますので
Ah, after this, I'll be doing a membership-only
3D live on the Watame Channel from 10:15 PM.

502
00:50:29,474 --> 00:50:33,314
他の衣装のね、この小顔のわためも見てほしいなと思います
So I'd like you to see this small-faced Watame
in other outfits too.

503
00:50:34,314 --> 00:50:37,754
歌って踊りますんで、ぜひ10時15分メンバーシップに入ってお待ちください
I'll be singing and dancing, so please join
the membership and wait for 10:15 PM.

504
00:50:38,474 --> 00:50:41,634
でも！まだライブも終わりではありません！ここで告知があります！
But! The live show isn't over yet!
I have an announcement to make!

505
00:50:42,314 --> 00:50:45,634
角巻わための新曲...「ビリ」、なんと発表いたします！
Tsunomaki Watame's new song... "Biri"!
I'm announcing it now!

506
00:50:46,314 --> 00:50:50,634
このあと10時からMVが投稿されて、で、楽曲配信が24時から始まります！
The MV will be posted at 10 PM, and the
digital release starts at midnight!

507
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:52,754
よろしくお願いします！
Please look forward to it!

508
00:50:53,474 --> 00:50:57,314
神田ジョンさん、篠崎あやとさん、DECO*27さんという布陣で作った
It was made by a team consisting of
Kanda John, Ayato Shinozaki, and DECO*27.

509
00:50:57,874 --> 00:51:02,634
わための新しく、あたらしい部分だったりとか、まあちょっとあんまり歌ったことないような感じの曲になっているかなと思っているので
I think it shows a new side of Watame, and it's a type
of song I haven't really sung much before.

510
00:51:03,314 --> 00:51:05,674
ぜひ楽しみにしててください！あ、でも！
So please look forward to it! Oh, but...!

511
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:09,754
あ、でもこのあと、まだ一曲ぐらいをやる時間があるか...
Oh, but wait, there's still time for about
one more song after this...

512
00:51:10,474 --> 00:51:12,634
はあ、はあ、じゃあ、ビリやろうか！
Yeah, yeah... then shall we do "Biri"?

513
00:51:13,314 --> 00:51:17,634
えー、あと一曲、ビリ、新曲。ぜひみんなに聴いていただきたいなと思うので
Well, one last song. "Biri", the new song.
I'd really like everyone to hear it.

514
00:51:18,314 --> 00:51:23,634
最後まで、あのダンスも可愛いんで、ちょっと一生懸命踊ります。見てください！
Until the end... the dance is cute too, so I'll
do my best. Please watch!

515
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:27,634
では、最後の曲、聴いてください。ビリ。
Well then, please listen to the final song: "Biri".

516
00:52:25,994 --> 00:52:27,794
三度毎度でグダダダダ
Another flop, every single time

517
00:52:28,294 --> 00:52:30,494
もうハイローガチャでぐちゃぐちゃ
Messy high-low gacha games

518
00:52:30,994 --> 00:52:33,194
同情少年ポジグダダダ
Sympathy seeking, a sloppy position

519
00:52:33,694 --> 00:52:36,294
毎回歌うわなんてこったい感
I sing it every time, feeling like "good grief"

520
00:52:49,394 --> 00:52:51,494
三度やるだけやるしかない
Might as well just do it one more time

521
00:52:51,994 --> 00:52:54,094
もう小さいことで凹んでらんないわ
Can't be getting depressed over the small stuff anymore

522
00:52:54,694 --> 00:52:56,994
全うするまで育つだけさ
Just gotta grow until I see it through

523
00:52:57,594 --> 00:53:00,294
心配いらずのジェットコースター
A worry-free roller coaster

524
00:53:00,894 --> 00:53:03,694
研ぎ上げた五感で
With my senses sharpened

525
00:53:04,194 --> 00:53:06,794
おめかしさぞかしハッピーでいっぱい
Dressed up and surely full of happiness

526
00:53:07,294 --> 00:53:10,194
描き込んだ願いが
The wishes I've sketched in

527
00:53:10,694 --> 00:53:12,594
香り立つ今僕になるんだ
Will become me now, fragrant and blooming

528
00:53:13,094 --> 00:53:15,994
僕しかできないこと
The things only I can do

529
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:18,594
認めてほしいの
I want you to acknowledge them

530
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:22,294
「どうせ」とか思ってらんないわ
I can't keep thinking "well, whatever"

531
00:53:24,794 --> 00:53:27,394
妄言ばこん！切り刻んでいこう
Nonsense, pow! Let's slice it all up

532
00:53:27,694 --> 00:53:30,394
まだ一等賞まで放電がありそう
Seems like there's still a spark left for first place

533
00:53:30,694 --> 00:53:33,294
当選しちゃうかは挑戦次第
Whether I win or not depends on the challenge

534
00:53:33,694 --> 00:53:36,294
やるかやらないかだ
It's about whether you do it or not

535
00:53:36,694 --> 00:53:39,294
「はぁめんどっぽい」これでエンドっぽい
"Ugh, what a pain." Seems like this is the end

536
00:53:39,694 --> 00:53:42,294
叩き潰した弱音がちょー痛い
The complaints I crushed are super painful

537
00:53:42,694 --> 00:53:45,194
夢が叶っちゃって甘くなれ
My dreams came true, so get soft

538
00:53:45,694 --> 00:53:48,494
黙れ！判定はノーノーノー グッバイ
Shut up! The verdict is no-no-no, goodbye

539
00:53:59,794 --> 00:54:02,294
三度やるだけやるだけバッド
One more time, just doing it is bad enough

540
00:54:02,694 --> 00:54:05,294
もう涙腺アミダ全泣きが確定
My tear ducts are a lottery, crying is guaranteed

541
00:54:06,194 --> 00:54:08,694
同情求めてはわわわわわ
Seeking sympathy, hawawawa

542
00:54:09,094 --> 00:54:11,394
ねえちゃんと抱きしめて
Hey, hold me tight

543
00:54:12,294 --> 00:54:14,794
顔出した絶望で
With the despair that peeked out

544
00:54:15,194 --> 00:54:17,794
ごまかし乗る歌詞ハッピーが足んない
Lyrics riding on deception, not enough happiness

545
00:54:18,294 --> 00:54:20,794
あたしを愛せない
I can't love myself

546
00:54:21,194 --> 00:54:23,794
比べたら比べるだけ負け犬（ルーザー）
If I compare, I'm just a loser the more I do

547
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:27,494
ありなし選べちゃうけど
I can choose between "yes" or "no"

548
00:54:28,094 --> 00:54:29,994
弱気になるかも
But I might get cold feet

549
00:54:30,594 --> 00:54:34,194
「どうせ無理」思って仕舞っちゃうわ
I'll end up thinking "it's impossible anyway"

550
00:54:35,094 --> 00:54:37,894
有言だもん！叶わないもん
Because I said it! Because it won't come true

551
00:54:38,294 --> 00:54:40,794
また一等賞指くわえて見てるの
Watching first place again with envy

552
00:54:41,294 --> 00:54:43,794
あたしじゃない誰かだったの
It was someone who isn't me

553
00:54:44,294 --> 00:54:47,294
ノーノー誰か代わってよ
No, no, someone trade places with me

554
00:54:53,294 --> 00:54:55,394
せーので間違いの未来
One, two, a mistaken future

555
00:54:56,294 --> 00:54:58,494
前進もっとハイになって
Moving forward, get even higher

556
00:54:59,194 --> 00:55:00,494
贅沢夢見ていたい
I want to keep dreaming big

557
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:01,709
声にしたい 息ができない
I want to speak out, but I can't breathe

558
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:03,709
ローさん黙ってね？
Ro-san, please be quiet, okay?

559
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:06,009
Wa wa 全部無駄に決まってるじゃん
Wa wa, it's all decided to be a waste, right?

560
00:55:06,309 --> 00:55:08,709
はあ？さあさあ 圧が強すぎる ブレーキ
Huh? Well, well, the pressure is too strong, brake

561
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:10,309
ブレーキ、アクセル 噛み合わないね 笑えるくらい
Brake, accel, they don't mesh, it's almost laughable

562
00:55:10,609 --> 00:55:12,009
それならこのまま行くしかないか
Then, I guess I have no choice but to go like this

563
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,709
やっぱり分担 それのがいいか
As expected, sharing it, is that better?

564
00:55:14,009 --> 00:55:16,309
大丈夫 無理無理 重ねて
It's okay, impossible impossible, layering it

565
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:22,009
僕しか会えない子と仲良くしてるの
I'm getting along with the one only I can see

566
00:55:22,409 --> 00:55:24,509
どうせならかまして見ちゃいますか
In that case, shall we try to make an impact?

567
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:27,709
かまして見ちゃいますか
Shall we try to make an impact?

568
00:55:28,009 --> 00:55:30,509
妄言はぱーん 切り裂いていけ
Delusions are 'bang!' Rip through them

569
00:55:31,009 --> 00:55:33,609
また一丁 しゃにむに加えて見てても
One more time, even if I try to add it recklessly

570
00:55:34,409 --> 00:55:37,209
誰かじゃない僕がいいんだよ
Not someone else, I'm the one who's fine

571
00:55:37,509 --> 00:55:39,809
OK！明日を叶えるんだ
OK! I'll make tomorrow come true

572
00:55:40,109 --> 00:55:42,709
鳴呼 飛ばせ！ 溢れ出せば
Ah, fly! If it overflows

573
00:55:42,909 --> 00:55:45,509
すり倒した美学でぐちゃみたい
Worn down, it's like a mess with aesthetics

574
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:49,209
夢が叶ったって止まらねー 黙れ！
Even if dreams come true, I won't stop, shut up!

575
00:55:49,409 --> 00:55:53,209
不完全は No No No No No No Goodbye
Incompleteness is no, no, no, no, no, no, goodbye

576
00:55:58,409 --> 00:56:00,209
ビリ ビリ ビリ
Biri biri biri

577
00:56:06,709 --> 00:56:08,709
ビリ ビリ ビリ ビリ
Biri biri biri biri

578
00:56:17,029 --> 00:56:17,859
みんなー！
Everyone!

579
00:56:17,859 --> 00:56:21,709
角巻わため生誕祭2025 アニソンNight Fever!!
Watame Birthday 2025: Anison Night Fever!!

580
00:56:21,709 --> 00:56:24,209
楽しんでいただけましたでしょうかー！
