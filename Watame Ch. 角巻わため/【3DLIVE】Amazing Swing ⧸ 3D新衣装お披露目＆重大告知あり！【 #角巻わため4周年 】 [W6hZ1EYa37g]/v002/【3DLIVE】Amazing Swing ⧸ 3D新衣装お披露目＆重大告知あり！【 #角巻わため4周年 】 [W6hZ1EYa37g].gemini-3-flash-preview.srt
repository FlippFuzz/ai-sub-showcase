Do-do-do-do-down

49
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:29,866
Go for broke!

50
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:35,466
埃着飾ら見てまま ごちゃごちゃフロア転ばらぬトマササイズ
Decked out in dust, look as you are; the cluttered floor, no-fall Watama-cise

51
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:39,166
退廃的な大事実の劇だ 待機室も一流のフィクサーばかり
A decadent great truth's play; the waiting room is full of top-notch fixers

消えたい言葉を探して
Searching for words to make me disappear

111

いつだってフーフーさ
I'm always like "foo-foo"!

126
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:04,491
天気予報はアテにならないから
Since the weather forecast can't be trusted

00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:23,091
止まらない
Never stopping

142
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,991
止まらない
Never stopping

143
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:26,991
止まらない
Never stopping

144
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:28,991
止まらない
Never stopping

145
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,991
止まらない
Never stopping

146
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,991
止まらない
Never stopping

147
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:34,991
止まらない
Never stopping

148
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:36,991
止まらない
Never stopping

149
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:40,591
上げてきな DANCE STEP キミの瞳から
Turn it up, DANCE STEP, from your eyes

150
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:44,591
輝きを奪う 流星群
A meteor shower that steals the sparkle

151
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:48,591
秘密のドアを 抜けてきて
Come through the secret door

152
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:52,291
You and I oh yeah! (Oh yeah!) (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

153
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:56,191
shake shake 今夜は止まらない
shake shake, it's not stopping tonight

154
00:11:56,491 --> 00:12:00,191
だから今は 夢の中
So for now, we're in a dream

155
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:04,191
ミラーボールが回り回る ハニー
The mirror ball spins round and round, honey

156
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:07,691
oh yeah! (oh yeah!) (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

157
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:11,591
寂しくたって 一人きりの夜には
Even if it's lonely, on those nights all alone

158
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:14,591
癒えない言葉 ボクが探して
I'll look for words that can't be healed

159
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:18,591
秘密のドアを 抜けてきて
Come through the secret door

160
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:22,291
You and I oh yeah! (Oh yeah!) (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

161
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:26,191
shake shake 今夜は止まらない
shake shake, it's not stopping tonight

162
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:30,191
だから今は 夢の中
So for now, we're in a dream

163
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:34,191
ミラーボールが回り回る ハニー
The mirror ball spins round and round, honey

164
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:44,591
oh yeah! (oh yeah!) (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

165
00:12:57,591 --> 00:13:01,291
全然つかめないキミのこと
I can't grasp anything about you at all

166
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:05,191
全然知らないうちに
Without me knowing it at all

167
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:09,191
ココロ奪われるなんてこと
That my heart could be stolen away

168
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:12,191
あるはずないでしょ
There's no way that could happen, right?

169
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:16,091
メランクリック
作詞・作曲：Junky
Melancholic
Lyrics & Composition: Junky

170
00:13:25,191 --> 00:13:29,191
それは無愛想な笑顔だったり
Maybe it was that unfriendly smile

171
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:33,191
それは日曜日の日暮れだったり
Maybe it was that Sunday sunset

172
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:41,191
それはテストばっかの 期間だったり
Maybe it was those periods full of tests

173
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:45,591
それはキミという名の メランコリンニスト
It's a melancholinist by the name of "you"

174
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:58,591
手当たり次第強気でぶつかっても
Even if I hit you with everything I've got

175
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:02,191
なんにも手には残らないって思い込んでる
I'm convinced that nothing will remain in my hands

176
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:05,691
ちょっとぐらいの勇気にだって ちっちゃくなってふさぎ込んでる
Even at just a little bit of courage, I shrink and mope around

177
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:08,591
わたしだから
Because that's just how I am

178
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:12,591
全然つかめないキミのこと
I can't grasp anything about you at all

179
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:16,591
全然知らないうちに
Without me knowing it at all

180
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:20,591
ココロ奪われるなんてこと
That my heart could be stolen away

181
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:23,591
あるはずないでしょ
There's no way that could happen, right?

182
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:27,591
全然気づかないキミなんて
Someone like you who doesn't notice at all

183
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:31,591
全然知らない×知らないもん
I don't know you at all, I don't care

184
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:35,591
「ねえねえ」じゃないわ　この笑顔
It's not like I'm saying "Hey, hey", this smile

185
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:39,591
また眠れないでしょ
Now I won't be able to sleep again, will I?

186
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:05,541
明日も
Tomorrow too,

187
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,566
おんなじ
will it be the same

188
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:08,591
わたしが
me

189
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:10,616
いるのかな
who is here?

190
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:12,566
無愛想で
Unfriendly,

191
00:15:12,566 --> 00:15:14,591
無口なままの
remaining silent,

192
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:18,116
カワいくないヤツ
and not at all cute.

193
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:20,116
あー
Ah—

194
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:23,116
あの夢にきみが
Ever since you appeared

195
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:27,616
出てきたときから
in that dream,

196
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:32,116
素直じゃないの
I haven't been honest.

197
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:34,616
じゃないの
I haven't,

198
00:15:34,616 --> 00:15:35,616
だって
because...

199
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:39,616
全然つかめないきみのこと
I couldn't grasp a thing about you,

200
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:43,116
全然しらないうちに
and before I even realized it,

201
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:46,616
こころ奪おうとしてたのは
the one trying to steal a heart

202
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:49,116
わたしのほうだもん
was actually me.

203
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:56,616
ラララルラ...
La la lu la...

204
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:58,616
そういう時期なの
It's just that kind of season,

205
00:15:58,616 --> 00:16:00,116
おぼれたいの
I want to drown in it.

206
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:03,616
いとしのメランコリー
My beloved melancholy.

207
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:46,416
君の虜になってしまえばきっと
If I were to become your prisoner, surely

208
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:49,616
この夏は充実するの もっと
this summer would be even more fulfilling.

209
00:16:49,616 --> 00:16:54,616
もう戻れなくたって忘れないで
Even if we can't go back, please don't forget.

210
00:16:58,316 --> 00:17:00,616
summertime

211
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:16,416
何年経っても言えない
Even after all these years, I can't say it.

212
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:20,416
後悔したって構わない
I don't care if I end up regretting it.

213
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,416
でも言葉はここまで出てるの
But the words are right here on my lips.

214
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,616
ねえ サマータイム
Hey, summertime.

215
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:30,616
海岸通りを歩きたい
I want to walk along the coastal road.

216
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:34,616
ドライブだってしてみたい
I'd even like to go for a drive.

217
00:17:34,616 --> 00:17:37,616
ただ視線を合わせてほしいの
I just want our eyes to meet.

218
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:40,116
ねえ サマータイム
Hey, summertime.

219
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:45,116
夜明けまで海辺走って
Running by the shore until dawn,

220
00:17:45,116 --> 00:17:48,616
潮騒に包まれたいね
I want to be wrapped in the sound of the waves.

221
00:17:48,616 --> 00:17:52,616
彼女の仕草が甘いね
Her gestures are so sweet, aren't they?

222
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:58,916
君の虜になってしまえばきっと
If I were to become your prisoner, surely

223
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:02,916
この夏は充実するの もっと
this summer would be even more fulfilling.

224
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:08,616
噂のドリーミンガール忘れないで
Don't forget the rumored dreamin' girl.

225
00:18:09,616 --> 00:18:13,616
でも気持ちを伝えてしまえばいつか
But if I were to tell you my feelings, one day

226
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:17,616
この夢は覚めてしまうだろうな
this dream would probably come to an end.

227
00:18:17,616 --> 00:18:22,116
青い影が揺れる街角
On the street corner where blue shadows sway.

228
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,616
占いなんて信じない
I don't believe in fortune-telling.

229
00:18:28,616 --> 00:18:32,116
運命なんてあるわけない
There's no such thing as fate.

230
00:18:32,116 --> 00:18:35,616
ただ本当のことを知りたいの
I just want to know the truth.

231
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,616
ねえ サマータイム
Hey, summertime.

232
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:43,616
近づく距離にも気づかない
Not even noticing how close we're getting.

233
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:47,116
胸の高鳴りごまかせない
I can't hide the throbbing in my chest.

234
00:18:47,116 --> 00:18:50,616
でも昔と変わらずニブいの
But you're as dense as you've always been.

235
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:53,116
ねえ サマータイム
Hey, summertime.

236
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:58,416
思い出は色褪せたって
Even if memories fade,

237
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:02,116
惚れた腫れたの仲がいいね
it's nice to be so head-over-heels.

238
00:19:02,116 --> 00:19:06,116
彼女の笑顔が憎いね
Her smile is just too much, isn't it?

239
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:12,616
君の虜になってしまえばきっと
If I were to become your prisoner, surely

240
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:16,116
この夏は充実するの もっと
this summer would be even more fulfilling.

241
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:21,616
噂のドリーミンガール忘れないで
Don't forget the rumored dreamin' girl.

242
00:19:22,616 --> 00:19:26,616
でも気持ちを伝えてしまえばいつか
But if I were to tell you my feelings, one day

243
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:30,616
この夢は覚めてしまうだろうな
this dream would probably come to an end.

244
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:34,616
青い影が揺れる...
The blue shadows sway...

245
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:51,416
君の虜になってしまえばきっと
If I were to become your prisoner, surely

246
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:55,416
この夏は充実するの もっと
this summer would be even more fulfilling.

247
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:59,616
噂のドリーミンガール忘れないで
Don't forget the rumored dreamin' girl.

248
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:01,941
Ah...

249
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:03,891
噂のドリーミンガール 忘れないで
Don't forget the rumored dreaming girl

250
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:06,541
でも気持ち伝えてしまえばいつか
But if I convey my feelings, someday

251
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:09,791
この夢は醒めてしまうだろうな
this dream will surely come to an end.

252
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:14,641
青い影が揺れる街角
On the street corner where blue shadows sway,

253
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:17,141
Summertime

254
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:58,841
やあ、みんな！
Hi, everyone!

255
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:04,691
ラムベガス Amazing Swing 楽しんでますかー！？
Are you enjoying Lamb Vegas Amazing Swing!?

256
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,341
いやあ、バカタレサーカスでね、新曲と
Well, we had a new song with Bakatare Circus and...

257
00:21:08,491 --> 00:21:13,341
これはもう、アゲアゲな曲を最初にね、ちょっとぶっ放したかったので
I really wanted to start off with some high-energy songs,

258
00:21:13,491 --> 00:21:17,241
その選曲にさせていただいて、で、ぼたんちゃんとはメランコリック！
so I chose that setlist. And with Botan-chan, it was 'Melancholic'!

259
00:21:17,391 --> 00:21:21,141
なんか甘酸っぱい、え、好きなの？ どうなくっついちゃうの？ え、どうなの？
It's a bittersweet one, like 'Do you like me? Are we getting close? What's going on?'

260
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:25,141
みたいな感じのね、甘酸っぱい曲を一緒に歌って踊らせていただきました！
We sang and danced to a bittersweet song like that together!

261
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,291
そしてなんと、ファウナとも！
And then, I performed with Fauna too!

262
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:32,541
え、初めてわための記念配信で3Dでね、一緒に歌って踊って
It was our first time singing and dancing together in 3D on my anniversary stream.

263
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:37,441
Summertime。ちょっとわためが、あの、男の子のね、パートをやらせていただいて
Performing 'Summertime', I took on the boy's part,

264
00:21:37,591 --> 00:21:42,341
で、ファウナちゃんが女の子のパートをね、歌って踊っていただいて
and Fauna-chan sang and danced the girl's part.

265
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:44,941
どうだったかな？ どうだったかな？
How was it? How was it?

266
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:48,941
ちょっとね、やってみたかったんだよね。全部、楽しんでもらえてたら...
I've always wanted to try that. If you enjoyed it all...

267
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,741
楽しい？ 楽しい？
Are you having fun? Are you?

268
00:21:51,891 --> 00:21:56,341
ありがとう！ 楽しい。圧じゃない、圧じゃないからね！
Thank you! 'Fun'. I'm not pressuring you, okay!?

269
00:21:56,541 --> 00:22:01,941
ありがとうございます。でもまだまだ終わらない！
Thank you very much. But it's not over yet!

270
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:06,741
ここからゲストパート後半戦です！
Now for the second half of the guest segments!

271
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:10,991
うーん、楽しんでいこう！
Yeah, let's keep having fun!

ねえドクター、ヘッドクター メンテしておドクター
Hey Doctor, Head Doctor, please maintain me, Doctor

274
00:22:36,691 --> 00:22:39,541
またいつもの例のバグが
That usual bug is back again

275
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,941
ハッピー、アラッキー、息々するもっと
Happy, unlucky, breathing more and more

276
00:22:43,091 --> 00:22:46,541
組み立て全マイ、式の心、どこだ？
Assembled clockwork, where is the heart of the ceremony?

277
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:56,441
おかしいね、おかしいね、崩れないね イェイイェイ
It's strange, isn't it? It doesn't break, yeah yeah

278
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:59,491
わけないね、わけないね、ハイスペックなんで
It's easy, it's easy, because I'm high-spec

279
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,541
三千の保、やらなきゃさ
Three thousand maintenance tasks, I have to do them

280
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:06,941
ドキドキが止まりそう、ネジ巻いて
My heartbeat is about to stop, wind up the spring

281
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:10,991
なんていうか、エブリデイ ねじ巻いて ねじ巻いてよ
How should I put it, wind it up every day, wind it up

282
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:14,041
ちょっとだけね、ちょっちょちょっとだけね
Just a little bit, just-just-just a little bit

283
00:23:14,191 --> 00:23:17,991
ピーポパポ鳴らして 夢を作る
Beep-bo-ba-po, making a dream

284
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:20,541
ちょっとだけね、ちょっちょちょっとだけね
Just a little bit, just-just-just a little bit

285
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:23,991
いまはまだ、止まっちゃいそう、そのうち
Right now, it feels like it's going to stop soon

286
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:27,541
なくなっちゃうかも、リルビ リルビ もっと
I might lose it, Lilyby Lilyby more

287
00:23:34,741 --> 00:23:37,991
ねえドクター、メンテしたのドクター？
Hey Doctor, did you maintain me, Doctor?

288

つないでみて 繰り返してく衝動
Try connecting them, the repeating impulse

379
00:30:24,591 --> 00:30:28,591
揺らいだ 目の前に広がる世界
The swaying world spreading before my eyes

380
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:33,591
星屑のメロディ 歌に乗せてた
I put the stardust melody into a song

381
00:30:34,191 --> 00:30:38,191
グッと鮮やかに 眩ませるように
Vividly, as if to dazzle

駆け抜けるよ スターライト
I'll dash through, Starlight

383

We can fly so! 僕らは いつしか
We can fly so! Before we know it, we...

384
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:52,591
夢の中惹かれて ただがむしゃらに 走り続けたよ
...were drawn into a dream, and just kept running recklessly.

385
00:30:52,991 --> 00:30:56,791
無限の宇宙に 響いて
Resonating in the infinite universe,

386
00:30:56,991 --> 00:31:00,191
君を照らす声は どこへだって

ひらり 飛んでいけるさ

388
00:31:12,991 --> 00:31:17,191
愉快な 仲間と歩いた日日常
The happy days I spent with my friends,

389
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:21,791
掴んでみて 指先の意図せ
try grasping them, the intentions of my fingertips.

390
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:26,591
滲んでいく 目の前に広がった限界は
The boundaries that blurred before my eyes...

391
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:31,391
みんなの手重ねて ぶち壊して
...let's stack our hands and break them down!

392
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:36,591
吸い込まれそうな 夜空を見上げて
Looking up at the night sky that seems to suck me in,

393
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:39,191
今叫ぶよ スターライト
I'll shout out now, Starlight!

394
00:31:40,991 --> 00:31:44,791
I wanna be so! 僕らは いつでも
I wanna be so! We will always...

395
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:50,591
そばで笑い合って 溢れる声が 遠く木霊する
...smile together, and our voices will echo far away.

396
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:54,791
願いのカケラ 灯して
Lighting the fragments of our wishes,

397
00:31:54,991 --> 00:31:58,191
君の腕を引いて どこへだって
taking your hand, anywhere...

398
00:31:58,191 --> 00:32:02,591
ひらり 飛んでいけるさ
...it can flutter and fly!

399
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:22,191

Even on days when I'm a bit anxious,

400
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:24,591
魔法をかけてハッピー
I'll cast a spell and be happy!

401
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:28,991
百人力で乗り越えていこう
Let's overcome it with the strength of a hundred!

402
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:33,591
アクアブルーに染まる 大空目掛けて
Aiming for the vast sky dyed in aqua blue,

403
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:38,391
鼓動が弾んでいく
my heartbeat starts to bounce!

404
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:43,791
We can fly so! 僕らは
We can fly so! We...

405
00:32:43,991 --> 00:32:48,191
この日をずっと待ってたんだ
...have been waiting for this day forever!

406
00:32:48,391 --> 00:32:50,191
まだ覚めないで
Please, don't wake up yet!

407
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:54,791
スターライト！僕らは 止まらない
Starlight! We won't stop!

408
00:32:54,991 --> 00:33:00,591
その光が消える 1秒前まで 走り続けよう
Let's keep running until one second before that light fades out!

409
00:33:00,991 --> 00:33:04,791
無限の宇宙に 響いて
Resonating in the infinite universe,

410
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:08,191
君を照らす声を 強く抱いて
holding the voice that lights you up tightly...

411
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:12,591
きらり 輝いていけ！
...go and shine brightly!

412
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:43,591
いやあ！楽しいねえ！
Wow! This is fun!

413
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:47,991
やあゲストパートもね、一区切りつきまして
Well, the guest part has come to a close,

414
00:33:48,191 --> 00:33:53,791
このロボ子ちゃんとマリンちゃんとスバルちゃんという
with Roboco-chan, Marine-chan, and Subaru-chan,

415
00:33:54,191 --> 00:34:00,791
かなり珍しい組み合わせだったのではないでしょうか
which I think was a pretty rare combination.

416
00:34:01,191 --> 00:34:06,991
でもね、もうずっとずっと呼びたいと思ってたね、みんなだからね
But you know, they're all people I've wanted to invite for a long, long time,

417
00:34:07,591 --> 00:34:10,991
こうやって一緒に歌って踊って
so being able to sing and dance together like this,

418
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:14,391
なんかね、セクシーな感じもね、出せたりとか
and showing a bit of a sexy side,

419
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:18,391
かっこいい感じも出せたりとかね、してたよね？
as well as a cool side... we did that, right?

420
00:34:18,991 --> 00:34:21,991
セクシーじゃない、してたよね？
Not sexy? We did it, didn't we?

421
00:34:22,191 --> 00:34:25,191
あれはセクシーだったよね、みんな
That was sexy, wasn't it, everyone?

422
00:34:25,591 --> 00:34:31,991
ま、ね、いろんな、まあ、わためをちょっと見てもらえたんじゃないかなーと思っております
Well, I hope you were able to see various sides of Watame.

423
00:34:32,591 --> 00:34:35,791
まあ、もうね、活動4周年ですから
I mean, it's already my 4th anniversary,

424
00:34:36,191 --> 00:34:40,791
ちょっと成長した姿もね、見せたいなーなんて思って
so I wanted to show you a slightly more grown-up side of myself.

425
00:34:41,191 --> 00:34:43,191
今フェロモン出てるから
I'm putting out pheromones right now.

426
00:34:43,591 --> 00:34:46,191
見せたいなーなんて思って、頑張りました
I wanted to show you that, so I did my best.

427
00:34:46,591 --> 00:34:50,791
いやーどうだったかな、楽しんでくれてるよね？
I wonder how it was... you're enjoying it, right?

428
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:56,191
いやー、わためはとっても楽しいです。いやめちゃくちゃ楽しい
Man, Watame is having so much fun. It's incredibly fun.

429
00:34:56,391 --> 00:35:00,191
こうやって3Dになって、衣装も...
Becoming 3D like this, and with this outfit...

430
00:35:00,216 --> 00:35:02,016
だいぶ増えたよね。
They've increased quite a bit, haven't they?

431
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,916
こうやってみるとね。
When you look at it like this.

432
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:08,716
いや、なんかその衣装も増えたことによって
Well, with the increase in costumes,

433
00:35:09,216 --> 00:35:12,716
隣にこう、メンバーと立って
standing next to other members like this,

434
00:35:13,716 --> 00:35:17,016
なんかこう、シナジーというか、
there's some kind of synergy, or...

435
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,716
なんか... なんだろうね。
some... what is it?

436
00:35:22,216 --> 00:35:24,216
なんかね、いいよね。
It's nice, isn't it?

437
00:35:24,716 --> 00:35:26,716
語彙力。
My vocabulary.

438
00:35:26,716 --> 00:35:30,716
語彙力はちょっと、5年目磨きたいなと思います。
I'd like to polish my vocabulary in my fifth year.

439
00:35:31,716 --> 00:35:35,216
いや、でもまだまだここでは終わりませんので、
But it's not over yet,

440
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:41,216
えー、この先もぜひ見てほしいなと思っています。
so I hope you'll continue watching.

441
00:35:41,716 --> 00:35:44,716
いや、それもあれなんだよ。
Also, there's that thing.

442
00:35:44,716 --> 00:35:47,216
サムネ見ていただけたかな。
I wonder if you saw the thumbnail.

443
00:35:47,216 --> 00:35:51,216
ま、見てるよね。待機中とかね。
Well, you probably did. While waiting and all.

444
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:53,216
多分見れるもんね。
You can probably see it.

445
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,716
そうだよね。ホロジュールとか載ってるもんね。
Right. It's on Holodule and stuff.

446
00:35:56,716 --> 00:35:58,716
あの文字見ましたか。
Did you see those words?

447
00:35:59,216 --> 00:36:06,716
し、ん、い、しょう、なんかお披露目があるとか。
"N-e-w c-o-s-t-u-m-e" unveiling, or something.

448
00:36:07,716 --> 00:36:12,716
それも、ま、もう後半戦だから、ね、あったりするんじゃないかな。
That might be happening since it's the second half now.

449
00:36:13,216 --> 00:36:15,216
ね、見たいよね。
You want to see it, right?

450
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:18,216
いや、お願い、見て、お願い見て。
Please, watch it. Please watch.

451
00:36:18,216 --> 00:36:19,716
頑張るんで。
I'll do my best.

452
00:36:20,216 --> 00:36:22,716
見てほしいなと思います。
I hope you'll watch it.

453
00:36:22,716 --> 00:36:25,216
では、ふぅ、落ち着いてね。
Now, *whew*, let me calm down.

454
00:36:27,716 --> 00:36:28,716
よし。
Alright.

455
00:36:29,216 --> 00:36:31,216
では、次の曲聴いてください。
Now, please listen to the next song.

456
00:36:32,216 --> 00:36:34,216

458
00:36:54,216 --> 00:36:57,216
ねえ 「おはよう」のあと
Hey, after saying "good morning,"

459
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,216
もう落ち込んでるの？
are you already feeling down?

460
00:37:01,216 --> 00:37:03,716
ああ やりたいことも
Ah, the things I want to do,

461
00:37:04,216 --> 00:37:07,216
怖い 叶え夢にしたい
they're scary, but I want to make them dreams come true.

462
00:37:07,716 --> 00:37:11,216
もうちょっとだけの自分
Just a little bit more of myself,

463
00:37:11,216 --> 00:37:14,216
もう一歩が踏み出せない
I can't take that one extra step.

464
00:37:14,716 --> 00:37:17,716
そう言えばオッケーだった
It was okay to say that,

465
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:20,716
逃げていられた
I could keep running away.

466
00:37:21,716 --> 00:37:24,216
でも君が笑って
But if you smile

467
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:27,716
「それでもいい」と言うんだったら
and say "that's okay too,"

468
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:30,216
恥ずかしいところとか
the embarrassing parts of me,

469
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:32,716
ダメダメなところとか
the useless parts of me,

470
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:35,216
見せたくなくなっちゃうでしょう
I won't want to show them anymore, right?

471
00:37:35,716 --> 00:37:38,716
どんな時も前を向いて歌っていたい
I want to keep singing while facing forward, no matter when.

472
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:42,716
ほら凹んで泣いて辛い時も
Look, even when I'm feeling down, crying, and having a hard time,

473
00:37:42,716 --> 00:37:46,216
強がってるけど平気だよ
I'm acting tough, but I'm fine.

474
00:37:46,216 --> 00:37:49,216
きっと君のためならできること
I'm sure it's something I can do for your sake.

475
00:37:49,216 --> 00:37:52,716
涙を大好きにばら撒いて
Scattering my tears into the things I love,

476
00:37:52,716 --> 00:37:56,216
弱くたって虹を呼び出せるよ
even if I'm weak, I can call forth a rainbow.

477
00:37:56,716 --> 00:37:59,716
明日も多分僕次第で
Tomorrow will probably be up to me,

478
00:38:00,216 --> 00:38:03,716
今日よりも輝いていく
and I'll keep shining brighter than today.

479
00:38:16,716 --> 00:38:19,716
ねえ 「おはよう」のあと
Hey, after saying "good morning,"

480
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:22,716
なんだか気分がいい
I feel somehow good.

481
00:38:23,716 --> 00:38:26,716
もう 「繰り返し」とか
No more "repetitions,"

482
00:38:26,716 --> 00:38:29,716
ない そう思えるよ
none; I can feel that way now.

483
00:38:30,716 --> 00:38:33,216
意外と怖くないね
It's not as scary as I thought.

484
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,716
あくまで個人の感想です
*This is just my personal opinion.*

485
00:38:37,216 --> 00:38:39,216
秘められた力とか
Hidden powers,

486
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,216
見たことない奇跡とか
unseen miracles...

487
00:38:41,716 --> 00:38:44,716
そんなのも妄想しちゃうかも
I might even fantasize about things like that.

488
00:38:45,216 --> 00:38:48,216
用意ドンで僕は変わる
I'll change at the "Ready, Go!"

489
00:38:48,216 --> 00:38:51,216
合図は君に出してほしい
I want you to give me the signal.

490
00:38:51,716 --> 00:38:54,216
大冒険する準備なら
If it's preparation for a great adventure,

491
00:38:54,216 --> 00:38:57,716
ちゃんと君の分までしておいたよ
I've already done your share too.

492
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:01,216
どんな時も前を向いて歌っていたい
I want to keep singing while facing forward, no matter when.

493
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:04,716
ほら凹んで泣いて辛い時も
Look, even when I'm feeling down, crying, and having a hard time,

494
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:08,716
強がってるけど平気だよ
I'm acting tough, but I'm fine.

495
00:39:08,716 --> 00:39:11,216
きっと君のためならできること
I'm sure it's something I can do for your sake.

496
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,716
涙を大好きにばら撒いて
Scattering my tears into the things I love,

497
00:39:15,216 --> 00:39:18,716
弱くたって虹を呼び出せるよ
even if I'm weak, I can call forth a rainbow.

498
00:39:18,716 --> 00:39:22,216
明日も多分僕次第で
Tomorrow will probably be up to me,

499
00:39:22,716 --> 00:39:25,716
今日よりも輝いていく
and I'll keep shining brighter than today.

期待のルーキーはシープなホープ
The promising rookie is a sheepy hope

503
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:07,591
その頭のホーンがさらにキュート
Those horns on her head are even cuter

504
00:40:07,591 --> 00:40:09,491
このくるくる巻いてるクールなムーブに
With these curling, cool moves

505
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,341
売るほどあるぜ良質なウール
I've got high-quality wool to sell

506
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:13,191
ハサミでチョキ　バリカンでスー
Snip with scissors, buzz with clippers

507
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:15,141
あったか毛布直販でーす
Direct sales of warm blankets!

If you buy today, believe it or not

さらにもう一個ついてきまーす
You'll get one more for free!

510
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:20,941
混迷する混紡の世界
In the chaotic world of blended fabrics

511
00:40:20,941 --> 00:40:22,741
鮮やかに救う救世主
A savior who saves vibrantly

一方こちら天然のウール
On the other hand, here's natural wool

516
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:31,091
合成繊維戦意喪失
Synthetic fibers lose their will to fight

517
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:32,541
元気ない奴はここに来な
If you're feeling down, come here

518
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:34,391
こころの綿パンパンにしてやんよ
I'll stuff your heart full of cotton!

519
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:37,241
よく晴れた日　光浴びて
On a sunny day, soaking in the light

520
00:40:37,241 --> 00:40:41,441
膨らませよう心の綿毛
Let's puff up the fluff in our hearts

521
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:44,441
寒い日には　温めるよ
On cold days, I'll warm you up

522
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:49,241
それがわたくしわための役目
That is my, Watame's, duty

523
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:52,741
白い雲に似せて
Resembling white clouds

524
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:56,241
こんな広い空に
In such a wide sky

525
00:40:56,241 --> 00:41:03,741
浮かべたらどうでしょう
How about letting them float?

526
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:07,591
眠れない夜は私の名を呼んで
On sleepless nights, call my name

色とりどりのふわふわの夢
Colorful, fluffy dreams

534
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,241
詰め込まれている奇跡のお菓子
A miraculous sweet packed full of them

535
00:42:00,241 --> 00:42:03,241
わためのわたがしなら食べ放題だぜ
If it's Watame's cotton candy, it's all-you-can-eat!

The cotton candy shop with a queue

540
00:42:09,341 --> 00:42:11,441
道のりは長い　険しく　甘くない
The road is long, rugged, and not sweet

541
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:13,241
溶けたザラメに　とろけるフレーバー
Melting sugar with melting flavor

542
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:15,241
カラフルな色で　無数の創造性
Countless creativity in colorful hues

543
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,241
宇宙に輝く星々にも似た
Resembling the stars shining in space

544
00:42:17,241 --> 00:42:19,241
割り箸でつかむ輝く宝石
A shining gem gripped by chopsticks

545
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:21,241
町内会の縁日の祭りに
At the neighborhood association's festival

546

欠かせない必須アイテム参上
An essential item makes its appearance

547

550
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:41,441
愉快な仲間と同じ時過ごして
Spending time with pleasant friends

551
00:42:41,441 --> 00:42:45,241
気が付いたらだいぶ遠くまで歩いてた
I realized I'd walked quite a long way

552
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:56,741
いつもみんながいたから
Because everyone was always there

553
00:42:56,741 --> 00:43:00,841
支えられてここまで来ました
I was supported and made it this far

554
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:07,241
お礼と言ってはなんですが
It's not much of a thank you, but...

567
00:44:42,341 --> 00:44:46,741

568
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:50,191
こちらアルバムに入ってます。
This is included in the album.

Can I show it to you slowly?

583
00:45:44,466 --> 00:45:45,566
いい？
Is it okay?

584
00:45:45,966 --> 00:45:49,666
こだわりポイントいい？ちょっとだけ、いいかな？
Can I show the special points? Just a little bit?

585
00:45:50,066 --> 00:45:53,566
まず、靴、見てみて！
First, look at the shoes!

586
00:45:54,266 --> 00:45:56,466
かっこいいよね。
They're cool, right?

587
00:45:57,266 --> 00:46:02,366
今回はね、スポーティな、そしてダンスも結構踊ったりするので、
This time it's sporty, and since I'll be dancing quite a bit,

588
00:46:02,366 --> 00:46:07,666
ダンスしやすいそんな衣装を頼みました。
I asked for an outfit that's easy to dance in.

589
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:09,866
いや、すごい。
Wow, amazing.

590
00:46:10,266 --> 00:46:13,966
そして太ももの...見る？太もも。
And the thighs... wanna see? The thighs.

591
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:21,466
ふー、ふー、むちむちな感じがね。
Phew, phew... that plump feeling.

592
00:46:25,266 --> 00:46:28,966
ちょっとライブなのに、変態みたい...
I'm like a pervert, even though it's a live concert...

593
00:46:29,466 --> 00:46:31,666
あとはね、尻尾！
And then, the tail!

594
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:37,966
なかなかね、わための衣装的に尻尾は見えないんだけどね、
Usually, Watame's outfits don't show the tail, but

595
00:46:38,466 --> 00:46:41,766
今回はガッツリ丸見えでございます。
this time it's in full view.

596
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:45,766
あとは...わきぺーもあります！
Also... the armpit point is here too!

597
00:46:46,066 --> 00:46:48,566
ふー！
Whoo!

598
00:46:48,866 --> 00:46:51,766
素晴らしい。この筋が素晴らしいね。
Wonderful. These muscle lines are great.

599
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:55,966
この筋がね。
These lines right here.

600
00:46:56,866 --> 00:46:58,966
あと髪型もね、
Also the hairstyle,

601
00:46:59,466 --> 00:47:04,366
ちょっとサイドポニーと言いますか、高いところからのポニーテール。
it's a side pony, or rather, a high ponytail.

602
00:47:04,366 --> 00:47:08,366
このクシュッとなってんだよね、頭の上がね。
It's all fluffy on top of the head.

603
00:47:08,766 --> 00:47:10,266
どうですかー？
How is it?

604
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:13,266
可愛いかな？
Is it cute?

605
00:47:14,566 --> 00:47:19,266
こちらもね、フェミ満々に仕立てていただきました。
This was also made to be very feminine for me.

606
00:47:19,566 --> 00:47:24,266
でもね、まだこれだけでは終わらないんだよね。
But, it's not over with just this.

607
00:47:25,066 --> 00:47:27,966
へへへ、何だと思う？
Hehehe, what do you think?

608
00:47:30,466 --> 00:47:34,666
あー、おー。
Ah, oh.

609
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:40,666
そう、わためはまだ変身をあと一つ残しているのだ。
Yes, Watame still has one more transformation left.

610
00:47:42,066 --> 00:47:43,966
見たい？
Wanna see?

611
00:47:45,066 --> 00:47:46,666
見たい？
Wanna see?

612
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:53,266
じゃあちょっと着替えちゃおうかな。
Then I think I'll change for a bit.

613
00:47:53,866 --> 00:47:57,666
そして、あの曲もね、まだ終わりじゃないので、
And also, that song isn't over yet,

614
00:47:58,466 --> 00:48:02,366
聴いてほしい曲がもう一曲あります。
so I have one more song I want you to hear.

615
00:48:02,366 --> 00:48:06,366
まだまだ盛り上がっていきましょう！
Let's keep the excitement going!

616
00:48:07,666 --> 00:48:10,866
では、次の曲聴いてください。
Now, please listen to the next song.

617
00:48:36,766 --> 00:48:40,666
スレスレ 波打つカップの上
On the edge, on top of the waving cup

618
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:46,566
ズレズレ もつれた拍子の上
Out of sync, on top of the tangled rhythm

619
00:48:47,666 --> 00:48:49,866
ドドドド ドライブして
D-D-D-D-Driving

620
00:48:49,866 --> 00:48:52,166
ギギギギ ギア入れて
S-S-S-S-Shifting gears

621
00:48:52,466 --> 00:48:54,966
パパパパ と片付けて
Cl-cl-cl-cl-Cleaning up

622
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,066
さぁ踊りましょう
Now, let's dance

623
00:48:57,366 --> 00:48:59,566
誰よりも没頭 もっと
More immersed than anyone else, more

624
00:48:59,566 --> 00:49:01,966
点々はドット ドッド
The dots are dots, dots

625
00:49:02,266 --> 00:49:04,166

E-e-e-e-even if I'm covered in wounds

629
00:49:14,266 --> 00:49:16,366
捨て身で Step
With a leap of faith, Step

630
00:49:16,766 --> 00:49:18,966
すれ違って
Passing by

631
00:49:18,966 --> 00:49:21,266

636
00:49:42,766 --> 00:49:46,966
徒然 半分ビートの上
Leisurely, on top of the half beat

637
00:49:47,566 --> 00:49:51,966
それぞれ ゆらしてこの場所で
Shaking in our own ways in this place

638

ふわー！みんな今日は本当にありがとう！
Whew! Everyone, thank you so much for today!

682
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:36,291
とっても楽しかったよー！
It was so much fun!

683
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:45,091
新曲の「Now on step」という曲を歌って躍らせていただきました。
I sang and danced to my new song, "Now on step."

684
00:52:45,091 --> 00:52:54,791
これはね、みんなにぜひサビの振り付けを踊ってもらいたいなと思って、ひろみ先生に振り付けを作っていただいたので
I wanted everyone to dance the choreography of the chorus, so I asked Hiromi-sensei to create the choreography...

685
00:52:54,791 --> 00:53:02,791
一緒にたくさん踊って騒ぎましょう、これからも！本当にありがとう。
...so let's all dance and have fun together from now on! Thank you so much.

686
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:08,791
4周年か…早いなあ。
Four years, huh... Time flies.

687
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:16,791
でもこう、ずっと笑顔を絶やさず…まあ泣いたりもするけど
But, you know, keeping a smile on my face... well, I do cry sometimes too...

688
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:22,791
でも、楽しく本当に今もこうしてわためが動き回れているのも
But the reason why Watame can move around like this happily...

689
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:30,291
みんなのおかげだと思っておりますので、本当に感謝！ありがとうございます。
...is all thanks to everyone, so I'm truly grateful! Thank you very much.

690
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:36,791
今日初めて知ってくれた人も、今までずっと応援してくれてる人も
Whether you found out about me today or you've been supporting me all along...

691
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:44,491
これからは5周年に向けて、まだまだ怒涛の羊頑張っていきますので
From now on, heading towards my 5th anniversary, this unstoppable sheep will continue to do her best...

692
00:53:44,491 --> 00:53:52,291
どうぞ応援よろしくお願いします！本当にありがとう！楽しいこといっぱいこれからもしていきましょう。
...so please continue to support me! Thank you so much! Let's keep doing lots of fun things from now on.

693
00:53:52,291 --> 00:54:01,291
おっ、このあと色々告知もあるので、チャンネルはそのままでお楽しみに！
Oh, there are various announcements coming up, so stay tuned to this channel!

694
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:14,291
さらにそのあとの面ゲンでは、この新衣装の上着バージョンもゆっくりお披露目したり
And in the members-only stream after this, I'll be showing off the jacket version of this new outfit...

695
00:54:14,291 --> 00:54:23,791
歌ったりしていきたいなと思ってますので、みんなぜひ遊びに来てください！
...and I'm thinking of doing some singing too, so please come and visit!

696
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:27,291
今日は本当にありがとう！これからもよろしく！
Thank you so much for today! I look forward to your continued support!

697
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:36,091
改めまして、4周年ライブ見てくれてありがとうございました！いや楽しかったね！
Once again, thank you for watching the 4th anniversary live! It was so much fun!

698
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:43,291
今回は、初披露のオリジナル楽曲を2曲も発表できて嬉しいです。
I'm happy that I could announce two original songs that were performed for the first time.

699
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:52,591
まず最初の1曲目は「Wata Meister」という曲で、作詞・作曲・編曲を剣持英郁さんにお願いしました。イエーイ！
The first song is called "Wata Meister," and I asked Kenmochi Hidefumi-san to write the lyrics, compose, and arrange it. Yay!

700
00:54:52,591 --> 00:55:00,291
「ハサミでチョキ　バリカンですー」というね、面白いワードも入っていたり、サビではエモい部分もあったり
It includes interesting words like "snip with scissors, buzzed with clippers," and the chorus has some emotional parts too...

701
00:55:00,316 --> 00:55:01,716
聞くのが心地よい曲かなーと思うので、
I think it's a very pleasant song to listen to,

702
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:04,216
ぜひ、わためのアルバム「Hop Step Sheep」をゲットして
so please get Watame's album 'Hop Step Sheep'

703
00:55:04,216 --> 00:55:06,616
何度でも聞いてください！
and listen to it over and over again!

704
00:55:06,616 --> 00:55:09,016
そして、最後に歌った楽曲は
And the song I sang at the very end,

705
00:55:09,016 --> 00:55:12,016
「Now on step」という楽曲で
is a song titled 'Now on step',

706
00:55:12,016 --> 00:55:14,616
この楽曲は以前にも「乙女のうたとわなる未来」という
and it was composed by Sato Yosuke,

707
00:55:14,616 --> 00:55:17,616
曲を作っていただいたことがある
who previously worked with me on the song

708
00:55:17,616 --> 00:55:19,816
佐藤陽介さんに制作していただきました！
'Otome no Uta to Wanaru Mirai'!

709
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:23,316
みんなと一緒に歌って踊って楽しめる曲になってますので、
It's a song we can all sing and dance to together,

710
00:55:23,316 --> 00:55:26,816
1月31日のセカンドライブで一緒に盛り上がりましょう！
so let's have a blast at the 2nd Live on January 31st!

711
00:55:26,816 --> 00:55:30,616
この後すぐ、「Now on step」のMVも投稿されるので、
The MV for 'Now on step' will be posted right after this,

712
00:55:30,616 --> 00:55:32,716
ぜひ見てください！
so please check it out!

713
00:55:32,716 --> 00:55:36,716
サビの振りもショート動画を上げる予定なので、
I'm also planning to upload a short video of the chorus choreo,

714
00:55:36,716 --> 00:55:38,816
練習よろしくお願いします！
so please use it to practice!

715
00:55:38,816 --> 00:55:41,516
そして、なんとこの後24時から
Also, surprisingly, starting from midnight tonight,

716
00:55:41,516 --> 00:55:43,916
楽曲配信もあります！
the song will be available on streaming services!

717
00:55:43,916 --> 00:55:46,716
「Now on step」たくさん買ってください！
Please buy 'Now on step' a lot!

718
00:55:46,716 --> 00:55:48,616
よろしくお願いします！
Thank you in advance!

719
00:55:48,616 --> 00:55:51,616
穴が開くほど聴いて、
Listen to it until your ears fall off,

720
00:55:51,616 --> 00:55:54,316
振りもたくさん練習して
and practice the choreography a lot,

721
00:55:54,316 --> 00:55:58,516
1月31日、めちゃくちゃ楽しいライブにしましょう！
and let's make the January 31st live an amazing one!

722
00:55:58,516 --> 00:56:02,416
そんな31日、もう一回おさらいです！
