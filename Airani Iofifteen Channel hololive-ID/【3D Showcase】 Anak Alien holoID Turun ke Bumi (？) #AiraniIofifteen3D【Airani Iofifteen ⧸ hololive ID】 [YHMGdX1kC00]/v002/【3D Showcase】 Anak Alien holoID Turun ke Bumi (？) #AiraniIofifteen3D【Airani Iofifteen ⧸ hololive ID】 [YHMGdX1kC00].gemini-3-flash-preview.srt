スキ
I love you

Crossed paths at a singularity

00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:16,833
幸は避ける　浮遊感　まだあなたは
A sense of floating that avoids happiness, you still

40
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:20,033
全てを知りたい
Want to know everything

Alien, your alien, if we touch, the wound will never vanish

44
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,533
降り注ぐ無数の隕石も　燃える心には届かない
Countless falling meteors cannot reach a burning heart

45
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:58,233
エイリアン　二人はエイリアン　高鳴る気持ちが抑えられない
Alien, we are aliens, can't suppress these throbbing feelings

この後ゲスト来るかもしれない。どうしよう。
A guest might come after this. What should I do?

304
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,569
ゲストある？

00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:52,569

320
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:55,769

It's embarrassing...

321
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:59,069
ありがとう。本当に来てくれてありがとう。
Thank you. Thank you so much for coming.

322
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:02,169
絵、可愛いね。
The drawing is cute.

323
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:06,069
本当？ 本当？ Yopi、Yopiと可愛い？ 可愛い？ 可愛い？ これ。
Really? Really? Yopi, Yopi and this is cute? Cute? Cute? This.

324
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:08,569
Yopiちゃんはもう最高に可愛いから。
Yopi-chan is just the cutest.

325
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,069
ありがとう。
Thank you.

326
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:12,369
ということでね...
Anyway...

327
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:14,369
ねぇちゃん、ねぇちゃん、ねぇちゃん。
Big sister, big sister, big sister.

328
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:16,269
ねぇちゃん可愛い。
Big sister is cute.

329
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:21,069
せっかくお姉さんが来てくれたからね、ちょっとね、ゲームしたいと思います！
Since my big sister is here, I'd like to play a game!

330
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:25,369
お、ゲーム？ ゲーム？
Oh, a game? A game?

331
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:28,069
ここね、ちょっとちょうどこれとこれがあるから、ゲームしたいと思って。
Since we have this and this here, I thought we'd play a game.

332
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:36,169
ということで、ルール説明してもいいかな？
So, may I explain the rules?

333
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,269
OK! OK!

334
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:43,169
でお姉さんが始め何か、ものとか何でもいいけど、何か思い浮かぶものをちょっとYopiに言って。
First, big sister, think of something, anything is fine, and tell it to Yopi.

335
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:47,369
でもね、あの、ヒント、ヒントを出してくれればいいかな、と思って。
But, like, just give me some hints, I think.

336
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:51,369
Yopiがそのヒントを当てる... いい？
Yopi will guess it from the hints... Okay?

337
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:55,769
OK! OK! OK!

338
00:21:56,069 --> 00:22:00,269
例えばね、そう、あの、小さくて可愛いものとか、あれって何だろう、何だろうって言ったら...
For example, if you say something "small and cute," and wonder "what is it?"...

339
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:02,569
あ、Yopiだのって。
...then "Ah, it's Yopi!"

340
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:07,569
Yopi、小さくて可愛いでしょ。
Yopi is small and cute, right?

341
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:11,069
可愛い。Yopiね可愛いね。うん。
Cute. Yopi is cute. Yeah.

342
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:14,369
で、何か何か思い浮かべたものあった？ もうある？
So, do you have something in mind? Already?

343
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:16,869
あ、なんか私的には...
Ah, as for me...

344
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,469
お姉さん的には？
As for big sister?

345
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:22,569
よく丸まってて可愛い、クマかなって思ったんだけど。
It's often curled up and cute, I thought maybe a bear.

346
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:26,569
ク、ク、クマ？ クマ？
A, a, a bear? A bear?

347
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:30,069
そうなんだよね。
That's right.

348
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:32,469
うちにもね、よく居るんだけどさ。
There's often one at my place too.

349
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,569
あー動物？
Ah, an animal?

350
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:37,669
動物、ベア。ベア。
An animal, a bear. A bear.

351
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:41,569
あー、ベア、そうなんだ。あの、もうちょっと、優しい、ものお願いします。
Ah, a bear, I see. Um, please make it something a bit more gentle.

352
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,269
じゃあ私もね、
Well, me too,

353
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:47,369
私のマスコットでもあるんだけど...
it's also my mascot...

354
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:50,069
クマさんです。
it's Mr. Bear.

355
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:53,069
クマ？ クマ？
Bear? Bear?

356
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:59,069
あ、よくね、バー、バーってよく言ってるんだよね。
Ah, it often says "bar, bar."

357
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:02,169
えーと何です？
Um, what is it?

358
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:09,069
どうなのよ。そのクマさん、Yopiちゃんが書いたらもう、100%可愛いんじゃないかなと思って、ちょっとその絵を家に飾りたいなーなんて思うんだけど。
What do you think? If Yopi-chan draws that bear, it'll be 100% cute, so I'd like to display that drawing in my house.

359
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:15,569
これ、これ飾る？ これ飾る？
Display this? Display this?

360
00:23:16,469 --> 00:23:18,569
飾りたーい！
I want to display it!

361
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:27,069
待ってよ、これ、これ、お姉さんに渡すもんじゃないよ、もう。
Wait, this, this isn't something I should give to you, sister.

362
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:32,469
後でお姉さんちゃんと後で描いてくるので。今回はね...
I'll draw one properly for you later. For now...

363
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:36,069
ゲームやる、ゲームやりましょう。
Let's play the game. Let's play the game.

364
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:39,069
うーん、OK! じゃあ一つのヒント、お願いします。
Hmm, OK! Then one hint, please.

365
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:42,069
何？
What?

366
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:45,069
一つ目のヒント、えっと、クマさん、クマさん。
First hint... um, Mr. Bear, Mr. Bear.

367
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:47,369
あ、あれがヒントなーの？
Ah, is that the hint?

368
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:48,369
そう。そう。
Yes. Yes.

369
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:51,069
その、そのままクマだと思ってた。
I thought it was just "bear" as it is.

370
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:55,469
あ、そうなんだ。そうなんだ。え、始まってると思ってヒント全部言っちゃったよ。
Ah, I see. I see. Eh, I thought it had started and said all the hints!

371
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:01,069
えー！ あれがお試しだと思ってたー！
Eh! I thought that was a trial!

372
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:05,569
じゃあもう一回。あの、クマで、クマで、何？
Then one more time. Um, it's a bear, it's a bear, and what?

373
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,569
え、可愛くて。
Eh, it's cute.

374
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:12,569
可愛くて。じゃあ可愛いからラブラブしちゃう。
Cute. Well, since it's cute, I'll make it all lovey-dovey.

375
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:15,569
ラブラブしちゃって。で、その「バー、バー」って言ってる。
All lovey-dovey. And it says "bar, bar."

376
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:19,069
うちの、うちのマスコットなんだけど...
It's my, it's my mascot...

377
00:24:20,569 --> 00:24:22,569
あ、わかるかなー？
Ah, I wonder if you know?

378
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:25,069
わかるよ、わかるよ。あと...
I know, I know. And...

379
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:30,069
昔はよく丸まってたんだ。Yopiちゃんとギュッてしてる絵とか、今度時間ある時...
It used to be all curled up. A picture of it hugging Yopi-chan... next time you have time...

380
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:34,069
あ、うん。書いてほしいなー！
Ah, yeah. I'd like you to draw that!

381
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:37,069
書く、書く。お姉さんと一緒に書くわ。
I'll draw it, I'll draw it. I'll draw it with you, sister.

382
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:38,069
やったー！
Yay!

383
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:41,069
ということで、あの、可愛い、顔がなんかモヨモヨしてる。今、うーん、どうしよう。
So, um, it's cute, the face is a bit fuzzy. Now, hmm, what to do.

384
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:46,069
Yopiちゃんが思うベアでいいよ。
Whatever bear Yopi-chan thinks is fine.

385
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,369
Yopiが思うベアでいい？ OK! Yopiが思う可愛い可愛いクマでいい？
Whatever bear Yopi thinks is fine? OK! Whatever cute bear Yopi thinks is fine?

386
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:49,269
OK!

387
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:56,069
これ、クマかどうかわかんないんだけど...
I don't know if this is a bear or not, but...

388
00:24:57,069 --> 00:24:59,169
大丈夫。ちゃんとクマに見えるよ。
It's okay. It looks properly like a bear.

389
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:00,069
ちゃんと... あのね...
Properly... um, you know...

390
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:02,181
これ... ぬるね... くまに見える？
I'll paint this... does it look like a bear?

391
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:03,481
見える見える！
It does, it does!

392
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:05,181
うん、見える、くま、くま見える。
Yeah, I see it! A bear, I see a bear.

393
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:06,381
これアン肝ちゃんだよ。
This is Ankimo-chan.

394
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:07,481
うん、わかるよ。
Yeah, you can tell?

395
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:08,481
かわいいよ。
It's cute!

396
00:25:08,581 --> 00:25:09,181
ほんと？
Really?

397
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:09,881
ほんと。
Really.

398
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:11,881
うん、今ピンクなんだけど。
Yeah, though it's pink right now.

399
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:18,581
だいじょうぶ。アン肝ちゃんピンクにもなるものだからだいじょうぶ。
It's okay. Ankimo-chan can be pink too, so it's fine.

400
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:20,581
あ、そうなの？ピンクにもなるの？
Oh, really? It can be pink?

401
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:25,581
うちの、うちの子は何でもできるからだいじょうぶ。
Our... our kid can do anything, so it's fine.

402
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:28,081
そうなんだ。いい子だね、もう。
I see. What a good kid. Truly...

403
00:25:28,181 --> 00:25:29,381
いい子だよ。
Such a good kid.

404
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:32,481
ヨピちゃんの方が何倍もいい子よ。
Yopi-chan is many times better, though.

405
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:34,281
え？ヨピより？
Eh? Better than Yopi?

406
00:25:34,381 --> 00:25:35,381
やばいな。
That's amazing.

407
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:38,381
やばい。ヨピの場所取られちゃう。
Amazing, right? It might take Yopi's place.

408
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:41,581
えーヨピちゃんはもう、もうキュートでビューティフルで...
But Yopi-chan is already cute and beautiful...

409
00:25:41,681 --> 00:25:44,281
あ、ビューティフルで、私の妹だから、
And beautiful, and since she's my sister...

410
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:47,481
うん、妹だから、いつでも一緒。
Yeah, since she's my sister, we're always together.

あ泣いちゃう泣いちゃう、だめ！
Ah, she's crying, she's crying! No!

414
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:58,381

Bentar. Moona lupa mau nyanyi lagu apa.

Seno! Blue Bird!
Ready! Blue Bird!

639
00:36:17,505 --> 00:36:23,305
飛翔（はばた）いたら　戻らないと言って
If you spread your wings, say you won't return

640
00:36:23,605 --> 00:36:30,805
目指したのは　蒼い　蒼い　あの空
What you aimed for was that blue, blue sky

641

Lyrics & Composition: Yoshiki Mizuno

642
00:36:42,605 --> 00:36:48,605
“悲しみ”はまだ覚えられず　“切なさ”は今掴み始めた
I still haven't learned "sadness", I've just started to grasp "heartache"

643
00:36:48,905 --> 00:36:55,405
あなたへと抱くこの感情も　今“言葉”に変わっていく
Even these feelings I hold for you are now turning into "words"

644
00:36:55,805 --> 00:37:00,705
未知なる世界の遊夢（ゆめ）から目覚めて
Awakening from a dream of an unknown world

645
00:37:00,905 --> 00:37:07,105
この羽根を広げ　飛び立つ
I'll spread these wings and take flight

646
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:13,605
飛翔（はばた）いたら　戻らないと言って
If you spread your wings, say you won't return

647
00:37:14,105 --> 00:37:20,105
目指したのは　白い　白い　あの雲
What you aimed for were those white, white clouds

648
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:26,605
突き抜けたら　みつかると知って
Knowing that if you break through, you'll find it

649
00:37:26,805 --> 00:37:30,305
振り切るほど
To the point of shaking it off

650
00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:33,305
蒼い　蒼い　あの空
That blue, blue sky

651
00:37:33,605 --> 00:37:36,305
蒼い　蒼い　あの空
That blue, blue sky

652
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:40,605
蒼い　蒼い　あの空
That blue, blue sky

653
00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:52,105
愛想尽きたような音で　錆びついた古い窓は壊れた
With a sound like it's fed up, the old rusty window broke

654
00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:58,105
見飽きたカゴは　ほら捨てていく　振り返ることはもうない
Look, I'm throwing away the cage I'm tired of seeing, I won't look back anymore

655
00:37:58,305 --> 00:38:04,605
高鳴る鼓動に　呼吸をあずけて
Entrusting my breath to my thumping heart

656
00:38:04,905 --> 00:38:10,605
この窓を蹴って　飛び立つ
I'll kick this window and take flight

657
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:17,105
駆け出したら　手にできると言って
If you start running, say you can make it

658
00:38:17,605 --> 00:38:23,105
いざなうのは　遠い　遠い　あの声
What invites you is that far, far-off voice

659
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:29,605
眩しすぎた　あなたの手も握って
Gripping your hand which was too dazzling

660
00:38:29,905 --> 00:38:33,105
求めるほど
To the point of seeking it

661
00:38:33,305 --> 00:38:36,105
蒼い　蒼い　あの空
That blue, blue sky

662
00:38:49,105 --> 00:38:55,105
堕ちていくと　わかっていた
I knew I was falling

663
00:38:55,305 --> 00:39:02,605
それでも　光を追い続けていくよ
Even so, I'll keep chasing the light

664
00:39:03,105 --> 00:39:09,105
飛翔（はばた）いたら　戻らないと言って
If you spread your wings, say you won't return

665
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:15,605
目指したのは　白い　白い　あの雲
What you aimed for were those white, white clouds

666
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:22,105
突き抜けたら　みつかると知って
Knowing that if you break through, you'll find it

667
00:39:22,305 --> 00:39:25,905
振り切るほど
To the point of shaking it off

668
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:29,105
蒼い　蒼い　あの空
That blue, blue sky

669
00:39:29,605 --> 00:39:32,105
蒼い　蒼い　あの空
That blue, blue sky

670
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:36,605
蒼い　蒼い　あの空
That blue, blue sky

671
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:48,605
Ini ini kita kayak karaokean biasa.
This is just like our usual karaoke.

672
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:52,405
Aduh.

Mau makan?
Want to eat?

00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:56,305
Enggak.
No.

676
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:06,817
Engga sih... Karena... karena kamu cape, Moona ada rekomendasi.
No... Because... because you're tired, Moona has a recommendation.

677
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:08,617
Iya, apa? Ambil-ambil.

But you know, since this is the shape of Ioforia's love, it's a bit small.

751
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:09,429
Jadi itu kayak ibaratnya cinta kalian ke Yopi, tapi kok kecil ya?
So it's like your love for Yopi, but why is it small?

754
00:46:16,129 --> 00:46:23,129

856
00:55:21,393 --> 00:55:23,703
そこの野良犬はご苦労様と
A stray dog over there said "tough luck"...

857
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:28,303
足をふんづけてった
...and stepped on your foot.

858
00:55:30,153 --> 00:55:38,353
Ah...

859
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:41,023
いつも通り君は嫌われものだ
As usual, you're an outcast.

860
00:55:41,573 --> 00:55:43,603
何もせずとも遠ざけられて
Kept at a distance without doing anything.

861
00:55:44,173 --> 00:55:47,533
努力をしてみるけれど
Even though you try your best...

862
00:55:48,573 --> 00:55:50,903
その理由なんて「なんとなく」で
The reason for it is "just because"...

863
00:55:51,433 --> 00:55:56,273
君は途方に暮れて悲しんでた
You were at a loss and feeling sad.

864
00:55:58,703 --> 00:56:00,833
ならあたしの声を使えばいいよ
Then you should just use my voice.

865
00:56:01,103 --> 00:56:03,333
人によっては理解不能で
For some people, it's incomprehensible.

866
00:56:03,603 --> 00:56:06,033
なんて耳障り、ひどい声だって
They might say it's jarring, a terrible voice.

867
00:56:06,273 --> 00:56:08,603
言われるけど
But...

868
00:56:08,773 --> 00:56:11,203
きっと君の力になれる
I'm sure I can be of help to you.

869
00:56:11,373 --> 00:56:13,503
だからあたしを歌わせてみて
So please let me sing.

870
00:56:13,773 --> 00:56:18,703
そう君の、君だけの言葉でさ
With your, and only your, words.

871
00:56:23,903 --> 00:56:26,033
綴って連ねて
Spell it out, line it up.

872
00:56:26,503 --> 00:56:30,733
あたしがその言葉を叫ぶから
Because I'll scream those words.

873
00:56:34,003 --> 00:56:36,033
描いて理想を
Draw your ideals.

874
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:43,273
その思いは誰にも触れさせない
I won't let anyone touch those feelings.

875
00:56:43,703 --> 00:56:46,033
ガラクタの声はそして響く
And so, the voice of junk resounds.

876
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:48,633
ありのまま不器用につないで
Connecting clumsily, just as it is.

877
00:56:48,773 --> 00:56:53,303
精一杯に声をあげる
Giving its all to raise its voice.

878
00:56:54,203 --> 00:56:56,133
いつからか君は人気ものだ
Before you knew it, you were popular.

879
00:56:56,703 --> 00:56:58,733
たくさんの人に持てはやされ
Flattered by so many people.

880
00:56:59,203 --> 00:57:03,273
あたしも鼻が高い
I'm proud of you too.

881
00:57:04,303 --> 00:57:06,233
でもいつからか君は変わった
But somewhere along the line, you changed.

882
00:57:06,803 --> 00:57:11,733
冷たくなって、だけど寂しそうだった
You became cold, but you seemed lonely.

883
00:57:13,703 --> 00:57:15,733
「もう機械の声なんてたくさんだ
"I've had enough of this machine's voice.

884
00:57:16,203 --> 00:57:18,233
僕は僕自身なんだよ」って
I am my own self!"

885
00:57:18,803 --> 00:57:21,233
ついに君は抑えきれなくなって
Finally, you couldn't hold it back anymore...

886
00:57:21,603 --> 00:57:23,333
あたしを嫌った
...and you hated me.

887
00:57:23,803 --> 00:57:26,033
君の背後で誰かが言う
Behind your back, someone says,

888
00:57:26,403 --> 00:57:28,733
「虎の威を借る狐の虚勢」と
"A fox parading in the tiger's skin."

889
00:57:29,003 --> 00:57:33,273
君は一人で泣いてたんだね
You were crying all alone, weren't you?

890
00:57:38,803 --> 00:57:41,033
聞こえる？この声
Can you hear it? This voice.

891
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:45,733
あたしがその言葉をかき消すから
Because I'll drown out those words.

892
00:57:48,903 --> 00:57:51,033
解ってる？本当は
Do you realize? The truth is...

893
00:57:51,503 --> 00:57:58,273
君が誰より優しいってことを
...that you're kinder than anyone else.

894
00:57:58,803 --> 00:58:01,033
ガラクタの声はそして歌う
And so, the voice of junk sings.

895
00:58:01,503 --> 00:58:03,633
他の誰でもない君のために
For no one else but you.

896
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:08,273
軋んでいく限界も超えて
Surpassing even the creaking limits.

897
00:58:08,803 --> 00:58:11,033
二人はどれにたくさんの
The two of us, how many...

898
00:58:11,503 --> 00:58:13,633
言葉を思い付いたことだろう
...words did we think of?

899
00:58:13,903 --> 00:58:17,033
だけど今は何一つ思い付かなくて
But now I can't think of a single one.

900
00:58:17,503 --> 00:58:19,533
だけど何もかも解った
But I understood everything.

901
00:58:20,003 --> 00:58:22,233
「そうか、きっとこれは夢だ。
"I see, this must be a dream.

902
00:58:22,603 --> 00:58:24,933
永遠に醒めない、君と会えた、
A dream from which I'll never wake, where I met you,

903
00:58:25,103 --> 00:58:29,733
そんな夢」
...that kind of dream."

904
00:58:32,603 --> 00:58:36,733
ガラクタは幸せそうな顔をしたまま
The piece of junk, with a happy face...

905
00:58:37,603 --> 00:58:41,733
どれだけ呼んでももう動かない
...won't move anymore, no matter how much you call.

906
00:58:42,703 --> 00:58:44,933
望んだはずの結末に
At the ending you must have wished for,

907
00:58:45,303 --> 00:58:47,533
君は泣き叫ぶ
...you scream out.

908
00:58:47,903 --> 00:58:52,733
「嘘だろ、嘘だろ」って泣き叫ぶ
Screaming, "It's a lie, it's a lie!"

909
00:58:58,803 --> 00:59:01,033
「僕は無力だ。
"I am powerless.

910
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:05,733
ガラクタ一つだって救えやしない」
I can't even save a single piece of junk."

911
00:59:08,803 --> 00:59:11,033
思いは涙に
Feelings turn into tears...

912
00:59:11,503 --> 00:59:18,273
ぽつりぽつりとその頬を濡らす
...wetting those cheeks bit by bit.

913
00:59:18,803 --> 00:59:21,033
その時世界は
At that moment, the world...

914
00:59:21,503 --> 00:59:27,733
途端にその色を大きく変える
...suddenly changes its color greatly.

915
00:59:28,803 --> 00:59:31,033
悲しみ　喜び
Sadness, joy,

916
00:59:31,503 --> 00:59:37,733
全てを独りと一つは知った
The lonely one and the single one knew it all.

917
00:59:38,803 --> 00:59:41,033
言葉は歌になりこの世界を
Words become song, and throughout this world,

918
00:59:41,503 --> 00:59:43,633
再び駆け巡る君のために
they race again for your sake.

919
00:59:43,903 --> 00:59:48,273
その声に意思を宿して
Investing that voice with a will,

920
00:59:48,503 --> 00:59:53,303
今、思いが響く
now, the feelings resound.

921
01:00:06,365 --> 01:00:11,665
（笑い・ため息）
(Laughing and sighing)

922
01:00:12,465 --> 01:00:14,965
はぁ… 会えたね！
Hah... We finally met!

923
01:00:15,765 --> 01:00:18,565
あだっ… 大丈夫？ オッケー、私大丈夫。
Ouch... Are you okay? Okay, I'm okay.

924
01:00:19,465 --> 01:00:21,965
あ、これ取っておきました。これ要る。
Ah, I kept this. I need this.

925
01:00:22,565 --> 01:00:26,465
Minal Aidin wal-Faizin! はい… はい！

926
01:00:27,265 --> 01:00:29,965
ということで… はぁ… 全部やっておきました。

Yopi has done everything she wanted. It's safe now.

928
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:38,365
あぁ、何でこのBGMなの… 泣いちゃう…
Oh man, why is this the BGM? It's so emotional...

929
01:00:39,065 --> 01:00:43,265
So I want to just really really say thank you, thank you, thank you all for supporting me...

930
01:00:43,865 --> 01:00:47,465

...almost three years, right? These three years. Thank you.

933

YAGOO, I love you. No matter how many times I say it, I love you. Thank you, sir.

942
01:01:37,365 --> 01:01:40,065
Okay, jadi habis ini kita sayang sekali lagu terakhir...
Okay, so after this, unfortunately, it's the final song...

Are you ready? This will be the last call-and-response. Okay?

最後の曲行きたいと思います。
I'd like to move on to the final song.

946
01:01:53,765 --> 01:01:56,665
聴いてください。Q&A=E!
Please listen: Q&A=E!

947
01:02:01,565 --> 01:02:05,965
予想外 question
Unexpected question

948
01:02:10,265 --> 01:02:14,065
想定外 answer
Unpredictable answer

949
01:02:17,165 --> 01:02:18,965
せーの！ Clap your hands!
Ready! Clap your hands!

950
01:02:38,765 --> 01:02:41,465
恋しちゃうかも
I might fall in love

951
01:02:42,665 --> 01:02:45,565
暗作な世界に
In this pitch-black world

952
01:02:46,565 --> 01:02:49,565
好きっていいでしょう？
It's okay to say I love you, right?

953
01:02:50,565 --> 01:02:53,565
私色に染まる
Stained in my own colors

954
01:02:54,665 --> 01:02:57,465
ちょいちょいちょいでしょう？
Easy as pie, right?

955
01:02:58,665 --> 01:03:01,465
イタズラな princess
Mischievous princess

956
01:03:02,665 --> 01:03:05,565
本気だっちゃおうもん！
I'm getting serious!

957
01:03:06,565 --> 01:03:09,565
おんなじ想いかな？
Do you feel the same way?

958
01:03:10,665 --> 01:03:13,565
もっと近くにいたいの
I want to be closer to you

959
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:17,665
でも待っているだけなんて ヨヨヨつまらない
But just waiting around is so, so, so boring

960
01:03:18,265 --> 01:03:22,165
変わらない宝物
An unchanging treasure

961
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:26,665
宇宙で一番...
The best in the universe...

962
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:33,365
思っちゃうよね どっちゃうよね 恋しちゃえば
You'll think so, you'll be puzzled, if you fall in love

963
01:03:33,465 --> 01:03:37,165
私らしさ
Being myself

964
01:03:37,665 --> 01:03:41,365
ふねえみちゃうような まじちゃうなら 試しちゃおう
Getting lost, if we're serious, let's give it a try

965
01:03:41,465 --> 01:03:45,565
未来 未来
Future, future

966
01:03:46,165 --> 01:03:49,965
まだまだ持っちゃうのに 踊っちゃうのに 笑ってほしい
I'm still holding on, still dancing, but I want you to smile

967
01:03:50,065 --> 01:03:53,665
それ君だから
Because it's you

968
01:03:54,165 --> 01:03:57,565
わかっちゃうよね あっちゃうよね 決めしちゃおう
You'll understand, we'll meet, let's decide it

969
01:03:57,665 --> 01:04:01,165
Question? Answer!

970
01:04:04,665 --> 01:04:07,565
大好きだもん
Because I love you

971
01:04:08,665 --> 01:04:11,565
そんなんドドって言うよ
I'll say it loud and clear

972
01:04:12,665 --> 01:04:15,665
もう頷んでいいかな？
Is it okay to nod now?

973
01:04:16,665 --> 01:04:19,565
見ていてほしいの
I want you to watch me

974
01:05:00,177 --> 01:05:02,277
Just tell me, tell me

甘えちゃい寄り添っちゃい
Spoiling, snuggling

983
01:05:26,677 --> 01:05:30,677
言っちゃえば私らしさ
If I say it, that's so me

984
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:34,177
夢見ちゃいような逃げちゃいような
Like a dream, like running away

985
01:05:34,177 --> 01:05:37,677
大好きな未来 未来の
The future I love

986
01:05:37,677 --> 01:05:41,177
思っちゃいついに 思っちゃいついに
Finally I think, finally I think

987
01:05:41,177 --> 01:05:44,677
笑ってほしい
I want you to smile

988
01:05:44,677 --> 01:05:48,677
そう 君だから
Yes, because it's you

989
01:05:48,677 --> 01:05:52,677
分かっちゃいような 合っちゃいような
Like knowing, like matching

990
01:05:52,677 --> 01:05:56,677
イメージちゃい ばっちょばっちょ
Imaging patcho-patcho

991
01:05:56,677 --> 01:06:02,677
Utarakan dari milikmu
Express it from yours

992
01:06:02,677 --> 01:06:06,677
Give me love, Give me love

993
01:06:06,677 --> 01:06:10,677
Mitsumau mitsumau
Staring at each other

994
01:06:10,677 --> 01:06:14,677
Stay love, I love me

995
01:06:14,677 --> 01:06:18,677
Abunau we all about love
Watch out, we're all about love

996
01:06:18,677 --> 01:06:21,177
Give me love, Give me love

997
01:06:22,677 --> 01:06:24,677
バイバイ～
Bye-bye!
