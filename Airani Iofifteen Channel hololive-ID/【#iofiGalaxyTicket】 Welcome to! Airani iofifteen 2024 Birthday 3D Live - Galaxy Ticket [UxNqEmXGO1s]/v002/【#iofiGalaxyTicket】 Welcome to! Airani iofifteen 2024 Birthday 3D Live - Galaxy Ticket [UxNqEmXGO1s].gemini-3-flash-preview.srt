I really really love this song and I really love the... the meaning behind the song.

00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:36,233
So if you can, you can just search up the song later, okay?

94
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:43,333
Jadi aku pilih ini karena... wah, punya suka banget lho dari judulnya aja kan kayak "Wah, Start Line, start pertama kali."
So I chose this because... well, I really like it from the title alone, like, "Wow, Start Line, the very first start."

95
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:47,433
Nah begitu. Gimana, suka? Ada yang tahu lagunya?

107
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:25,233
So today I went worldwide with the theme today.

108
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:28,033
And actually I have a lot of guests, and guess what?

109
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:30,533
まだ、まだいるんですけど...
There are still more...

110

What's this? There's a palette. So, from here I want to... collect the colors from all the guests.

113
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:50,033
あ、でもね、他の色が、えーと、とりあえず自分の色塗るかな？
Ah, but for the other colors, um, for now I'll paint my own color, I guess?

114
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,433
待ってね。
Wait a moment.

115
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,433
よしよし。
Alright, alright.

116
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,333
オッケー！
Okay!

00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:55,533
じゃじゃーん！
Ta-da!

118
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:59,333

Whoa... crazy. This first one is Iofy's color.

119
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:03,033
Jadi nanti kalau guest-nya ada, nanti akan bertambah.
So later when the guests are here, it will increase.

120
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:08,533
Wah! We're gonna collect colors from each member. I wonder what happens.

121
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:12,733
これね、集まったら何が居るのかな？
I wonder what will be there when they're all collected?

122
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,533
それは楽しみにしておいてね。
Please look forward to that.

123
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:19,433
では、大事だから閉まっておこう。
Now, since it's important, I'll put it away.

124
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:21,033
はい。
Yes.

125

Lyrics Music: azuma

134
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:05,045
あなたの歌姫
Your Diva

135
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,845
この色　このパソコンが
This color, this computer...

136
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:22,845
私の新しい　居場所なの
...is my new place to be.

137
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:28,045
今日からは　あなたがご主人様
From today, you are my master.

138
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:33,245
ぜったいに　大切にしてよね
Please, absolutely take good care of me.

139
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:38,845
ちょっと　何するの　こんな日はいいな
Wait, what are you doing? On a day like this...

140
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:44,245
私を　歌わせないで
...don't make me sing.

141
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:51,545
ちゃんと　あなたの言葉と思いを
Make sure you convey your words and feelings...

142
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:55,045
伝えさせて
...to me.

143
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:03,045
あの時　私を買ってくれた
Back then, when you bought me...

144
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:08,545
本当の　意味はちがうでしょ
...the true meaning was different, wasn't it?

145
00:11:08,845 --> 00:11:13,845
もう　私に　もっと歌わせて
Now, let me sing even more.

146
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:19,545
世界で　あなただけの歌姫なの
I am your one and only diva in the world.

147
00:11:30,545 --> 00:11:40,045
あなたに出会ってからの　私の想いは秘密なの
My feelings since I met you are a secret.

148
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:46,045
今日もまた　あなたのレッスンがある
Today again, I have your lesson.

あなたの歌をぜんぶ歌うまで
Until I sing all of your songs.

00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:23,569
見たって！おぉー！
They saw it! Wow!

302
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:26,569
すごい一瞬だったもんね
It was just for a split second.

303
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:31,569
いやでも、それだけ私たちのことしっかり見てくれたってことだよ、ありがたいね
Well, it just shows how closely they were watching us. We're grateful.

304
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:34,569
ありがとねー
Thank you.

305
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:36,069
あ、何？
Ah, what?

306
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:41,569
ねぇねぇ、ちょっとイオフィ、プレゼントがあるんだ
Hey, Iofi has a present for you.

307
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:45,569
なんだろう？なんだろう？
What could it be? What could it be?

308
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:47,569
なんだろうね
I wonder what it is.

309
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:51,569
これだー！
It's this!

310
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:54,069
あ、それ実はイオフィ持ってるんだ
Ah, I actually have that.

311
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:55,269
え？
Eh?

312
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:59,569
ちょっとね、あれにぴったりなもの…うわっ！
Well, something perfect for that... whoa!

313
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:00,069
おぉー！
Oh!

314
00:25:00,406 --> 00:25:01,206
そうだね。
That's right.

315
00:25:01,531 --> 00:25:02,881
こっちこそー！
Likewise!

316
00:25:03,431 --> 00:25:04,581
じゃあ、これはしまっておこうかな。
Well, I'll put this away.

317
00:25:04,831 --> 00:25:05,531
そうだね。
That's right.

318
00:25:05,731 --> 00:25:07,431
大事だからちょっとしまっておこうかな。
It's important, so I'll put it away for a bit.

319
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:09,231
私、もうすでにしまっちゃってたわ。
I had already put mine away.

320
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:13,931
じゃあ、これもね、これからもまだまだということで。
Well then, there's still more to come from now on.

321
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:14,731
うん！
Yeah!

322
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:17,231
はい、また会おうかなと思いまーす。
Yes, I think we'll meet again.

323
00:25:17,381 --> 00:25:18,231
そうだね！
That's right!

324
00:25:18,431 --> 00:25:20,731
ゲストパートもまだ続くからね！
The guest part will continue!

325
00:25:20,881 --> 00:25:21,431
おー！
Oh!

326
00:25:21,631 --> 00:25:23,531
またね、みんなー！
See you later, everyone!

327
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:24,531
じゃあねー！
See ya!

328
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,531
じゃあねー！
See ya!

329
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:26,531
おめでとう！
Congratulations!

330
00:25:26,731 --> 00:25:28,431
ありがとう！
Thank you!

331
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:56,206
俺んとこ来ないか？
Won't you come to my place?

332
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:58,081
One Night Carnival

333
00:26:10,331 --> 00:26:13,531
One Night Carnival 胸の奥
One Night Carnival, deep in my heart

334
00:26:13,731 --> 00:26:16,931
ズキズキと音立ててる Angel
A throbbing sound is being made, Angel

335
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:20,931
とにかくもう行儀良く混じるなんて
Anyway, I was already tired of mixing in

336
00:26:21,131 --> 00:26:23,931
うんざりだった Angel
And being well-behaved, Angel

337
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:41,531
退屈に怯えてたのさ
I was frightened of boredom

338
00:26:41,731 --> 00:26:44,931
夜の闇に逃げ込んだ Angel
An Angel who fled into the darkness of the night

339
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:48,531
捨てゴミみたいなおれたち
We were like discarded trash

340
00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:52,431
帰る場所なんてどこにもなかった Angel
There was nowhere for us to return, Angel

341
00:26:52,931 --> 00:26:56,131
Can you master baby, master baby

342
00:26:56,331 --> 00:26:59,431
Can you master baby, master baby

343
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:02,931
Can you master baby, master baby

344
00:27:03,131 --> 00:27:06,431
Can you master baby, so long

345
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:10,931
瞬きもせずにおれたちは
Without even blinking, we

346
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:14,531
光の渦に巻き込まれてく
Are being swallowed by a vortex of light

347
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:17,931
雲の隙間に
In the gap between the clouds

348
00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:25,431
照らせ 青白い月を照らせ
Shine on, shine on the pale moon

349
00:27:25,631 --> 00:27:28,931
星空が Crystal
The starry sky is Crystal

350
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:33,931
淋しがり屋たちの伝説さ
It's the legend of the lonely ones

351
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:42,931
One Night Carnival

352
00:28:22,531 --> 00:28:26,431
幽かに香るタクティクスが
The faintly scented Tactics

353
00:28:26,631 --> 00:28:29,931
俺の胸を締め付ける Angel
Tightens my chest, Angel

354
00:28:30,531 --> 00:28:33,431
奴が最後に言った言葉を
The words that he said at the end

355
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:36,931
確かに俺たちは聞いたんだ Angel
We definitely heard them, Angel

356
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:40,131
Can you master baby, master baby

357
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:43,431
Can you master baby, master baby

358
00:28:43,631 --> 00:28:46,931
Can you master baby, be my baby

359
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:51,431
Can you master baby, so long

360
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:56,131
So long...

361
00:28:57,131 --> 00:29:00,931
俺達が急ぎ出した事に
There was no reason

362
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:04,431
訳なんて無かったよ
For us starting to rush

363
00:29:04,631 --> 00:29:06,731
ただ少しだけ 不器用だったのかもしれない
Maybe we were just a little clumsy

364
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:10,931
恋しているのさ
I'm in love

365
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:14,431
この夜に恋してるのさ
I'm in love with this night

366
00:29:14,631 --> 00:29:17,931
やがて海が見える
Soon the sea will be visible

367
00:29:18,531 --> 00:29:23,431
淋しがり屋たちの伝説さ
It's the legend of the lonely ones

368
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:30,431
One Night Carnival

369
00:29:31,131 --> 00:29:35,231
あの頃の俺達 闇の中じゃなきゃ夢見られなかった
Back then, we couldn't dream unless we were in the dark

370
00:29:35,631 --> 00:29:43,431
あのミラーボールみたいに 明るくてまんまるなお月様に憧れてただけさ
We were just longing for the moon, bright and round like that mirror ball

371
00:29:44,131 --> 00:29:48,431
行こうぜ ピリオドの向こうへ
Let's go beyond the period

372
00:29:48,631 --> 00:29:52,431
もうすぐ海が見える
The sea will be visible soon

373
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:57,431
淋しがり屋たちの伝説さ
It's the legend of the lonely ones

374
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,893
One Night Carnival

375
00:30:01,893 --> 00:30:03,893
One Night Carnival fun fun

376
00:30:03,893 --> 00:30:07,593
One Night Carnival oh let's get the feeling

377
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:11,893
Woo hoo!

378
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,593
Woo hoo!

379
00:30:14,393 --> 00:30:15,593
Woo hoo!

380
00:30:16,293 --> 00:30:17,593
Woo hoo!

381
00:30:18,493 --> 00:30:19,693
Woo hoo!

382
00:30:20,493 --> 00:30:21,693
Woo hoo!

383
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:23,693
Woo hoo!

384
00:30:24,493 --> 00:30:25,693
Woo hoo!

385
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:27,593
Woo hoo!

386
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,693
Woo hoo!

387
00:30:43,193 --> 00:30:44,293
イオフィ先輩！
Iofi-senpai!

388
00:30:44,293 --> 00:30:45,393
あ、ハッピーバースデー！
Ah, happy birthday!

389
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:47,393
ハッピーバースデー、イオピイオピ！
Happy birthday, Iopi-Iopi!

390
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:49,693
ありがとう！
Thank you!

391
00:30:49,693 --> 00:30:50,893
お前小（ち）っちぇえなあ！
Whoa, you're small!

392
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:52,093
小（ち）っちゃいよ、もう！
I'm small, I know!

393
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:54,493
なんか、連れ去られた宇宙人みたいだよね、本当に。
It looks like an alien being kidnapped, really.

394
00:30:54,493 --> 00:30:56,293
そう言わないでくださいよ！
Don't say that!

395
00:30:56,293 --> 00:30:58,293
オウガが特にでけえから。
Because Oga is especially big.

396
00:30:58,293 --> 00:30:59,893
あらら、あらら。
Oh my, oh my.

397
00:30:59,093 --> 00:31:00,293
助けてー！
Help me!

398
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:01,493
小（ち）っちぇえなあ！
So small!

399
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,093
じ、じ、じ、自分、小（ち）っちゃくないわよ！
I-I-I'm not small!

400
00:31:04,493 --> 00:31:07,093
なんか、どこかで聞いたことあるような、「小（ち）っちゃくないわよ」。
I feel like I've heard that "I'm not small" somewhere before.

401
00:31:07,093 --> 00:31:08,593
ポケットサイズ？
Pocket size?

402
00:31:08,593 --> 00:31:10,093
あ、ポケットサイズ。小（ち）っちゃいんだなあ。
Ah, pocket size. You are small.

403
00:31:10,093 --> 00:31:11,893
だいぶ小（ち）っちゃいじゃないですか。
You're quite small.

404
00:31:11,893 --> 00:31:13,293
とりあえずそろそろサングラス外していい？
Can we take off the sunglasses soon?

405
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:15,593
うん、なんかね、せっかくだからちょっとお顔見せたいし。
Yeah, since we're here, I want to show our faces.

406
00:31:15,593 --> 00:31:17,093
そうね、じゃあ外すか。
Right, let's take them off.

407
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:17,893
はい。
Yes.

408
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:19,893
えっと、じゃあ準備はいい？
Um, are you ready?

409
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:21,093
はーい！
Yes!

410
00:31:21,093 --> 00:31:22,593
せーの、はっ！
Ready, set, hah!

411
00:31:23,593 --> 00:31:25,593
おおー！
Whoa!

412
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:27,593
まあ、やっぱね、我らともなると...
Well, for people like us...

413
00:31:27,593 --> 00:31:31,093
こう、手を使わずにサングラスを取ることも可能になってきたからね。
It's become possible to take off sunglasses without using hands.

414
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:33,293
いや、すごいや。
Wow, that's amazing.

415
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:34,593
てなわけで。
Anyway.

416
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:35,893
改めて。
Once again.

417
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:38,893
改めて、ほぼ同期、荒咬オウガです。
Once again, almost from the same batch, Aragami Oga here.

418
00:31:39,093 --> 00:31:42,593
ほぼ同期、影山シエンです。こんにちは！
Almost the same batch, Kageyama Shien here. Hello!

419
00:31:42,593 --> 00:31:44,293
よろしくお願いします！
Nice to meet you!

420
00:31:44,293 --> 00:31:45,593
ありがとう！
Thank you!

421
00:31:45,593 --> 00:31:47,593
いや、呼んでくれてありがとうね、本当に。
Thanks for inviting us, really.

422
00:31:47,593 --> 00:31:49,093
いや、こちらこそ、ありがとうございます。
No, thank *you* for coming.

423
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:53,093
まさか、あの、「One Night Carnival」歌うとは思わなかったけどね。
I never thought we'd be singing "One Night Carnival".

424
00:31:53,093 --> 00:31:55,293
ちょっとね、えー、この曲ね、どうしても二人と一緒に歌いたいだけなんだよ。
Actually, I just really wanted to sing this song with you two.

425
00:31:55,293 --> 00:31:57,893
理由、普通に歌いたいだけなんだよ。
The reason is just that I wanted to sing it.

426
00:31:57,893 --> 00:31:59,293
あー、本当に？
Oh, really?

427
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:00,893
そう、特に理由ないんだよ、じゃあ。
Yeah, so there's no special reason.

428
00:32:00,893 --> 00:32:01,593
ない。
None.

429
00:32:01,593 --> 00:32:03,093
じゃあ、誰でもよかった？
So, it could have been anyone?

430
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:04,093
ん？
Hmm?

431
00:32:03,593 --> 00:32:04,593
いやいやいや。
No, no, no.

432
00:32:04,593 --> 00:32:05,593
誰でもよかった？
Anyone would do?

433
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:07,593
誰でもよかったじゃん！
Then it could've been anyone!

434
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:07,593
違うわよ！
No!

435
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,593
違うわよ！
No!

436
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,293
また、ほら。
See, there you go again.

437
00:32:11,293 --> 00:32:14,093
違うわよ、誰でもよかったわけではないんだけど。
No, it's not like just anyone would do.

438
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:17,093
あー、じゃあ逆に言うと俺たちと歌いたかったんだ。へー。
Oh, so conversely, you wanted to sing with us. I see.

439
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:19,593
いや、歌いた...んー、別にそれだけ歌いたいっていうわけでもない...
Well, it's not like I *only* wanted to sing that...

440
00:32:19,593 --> 00:32:22,593
ない、ないんだけどね。
No, it's not like that either.

441
00:32:22,593 --> 00:32:23,593
素直じゃねえな。
Not very honest, are you?

442
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:25,293
まあまあ、とにかくおめでとう。
Anyway, congratulations.

443
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:27,593
いや、本当にね、おめでとう、本当に。
Yeah, really, congratulations, really.

444
00:32:27,093 --> 00:32:28,593
ありがとう、ありがとう！
Thank you, thank you!

445
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:29,093
何歳になったん？
How old did you turn?

446
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:30,093
何歳？
How old?

447
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:32,093
えっとねー、ピー！ってなった。
Well... I turned PEEP!

448
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:33,293
あ、ピー？
Oh, PEEP?

449
00:32:33,293 --> 00:32:34,593
あー、そ、そ、そんなに？
Whoa, that much?

450
00:32:34,593 --> 00:32:36,293
そっかそっか、そこはじゃあ伏せとこう。
I see, I see. Let's keep that under wraps then.

451
00:32:36,293 --> 00:32:38,293
助かる、うんうん。
That helps, yeah.

452
00:32:38,293 --> 00:32:39,293
はい。
Yes.

453
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:43,093
でね、で、実はね、今日ね、ちょっとね、みんなからちょっとペイントね、ちょっと色を集めてるんですよ。
And, actually, today, I'm collecting some paint colors from everyone.

454
00:32:43,593 --> 00:32:45,093
おー、ほうほう。
Oh, I see.

455
00:32:44,593 --> 00:32:46,093
色？
Colors?

456
00:32:46,093 --> 00:32:47,093
そう、色ね。
Yeah, colors.

457
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:48,293
お、だれだれ？
Oh, who's first?

458
00:32:48,293 --> 00:32:51,593
お、こんなところに絵の具が！
Oh, there's paint in a place like this!

459
00:32:52,593 --> 00:32:54,593
お、俺も持ってたんだけど。
Oh, I had some too.

460
00:32:55,293 --> 00:32:56,593
お願いします！
Please!

461
00:32:56,593 --> 00:32:58,293
俺の角汁（つのじる）あげる。
I'll give you my horn juice.

462
00:32:58,293 --> 00:32:59,293
角汁（つのじる）じゃない、お願いします！
Not horn juice, please!

463
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:01,593
はっ！
Hah!

464
00:33:02,593 --> 00:33:03,593
はい。
Okay.

465
00:33:03,593 --> 00:33:04,593
あ。
Ah.

466
00:33:04,593 --> 00:33:08,593
おおー！オウガの色が追加された。
Whoa! Oga's color has been added.

467
00:33:08,593 --> 00:33:10,093
角汁（つのじる）です。
It's horn juice.

468
00:33:10,093 --> 00:33:11,293
あー、やったー。
Ah, yay.

469
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:12,893
じゃあ、シエンはどっから出す、シエン？
Then, Shien, where will yours come from?

470
00:33:12,893 --> 00:33:15,593
俺、尻尾からしか色出せないからさ。
I can only produce colors from my tail.

471
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,593
じゃあ、ごめんね、ちょっと絞るわ、ちょっと。
So, sorry, I'm going to squeeze some out.

472
00:33:17,593 --> 00:33:19,293
本当にちょっと。絵面（えずら）がやばいことになるから早く。
Just a little. Hurry up before the visuals get weird.

473
00:33:19,293 --> 00:33:20,593
早く早く！
Hurry, hurry!

474
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:22,593
まあ、お食事中の方はちょっとね、見ないように。
Well, those eating, please look away.

475
00:33:22,593 --> 00:33:23,593
行くぞ！
Here goes!

476
00:33:23,593 --> 00:33:24,593
はい！
Yes!

477
00:33:24,593 --> 00:33:25,593
うっ！
Ugh!

478
00:33:25,593 --> 00:33:26,593
待ってー！
Wait!

479
00:33:26,593 --> 00:33:27,593
ううっ！
Ugh!

480
00:33:27,593 --> 00:33:28,593
出ろー！
Come out!

481
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:29,593
ああー！
Aah!

482
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:31,593
はい。
Okay.

483
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:32,593
出た！
It's out!

484
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,293
奇跡的に。よかったよかった。
Miraculously. Good, good.

485
00:33:34,293 --> 00:33:36,593
いや、ちょっとちょっと。
Whoa, wait a minute.

486
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:38,293
やめろよ、汚い、汚い。
Stop it, that's gross, gross.

487
00:33:38,293 --> 00:33:39,893
汚くない！全然汚くない！
It's not gross! Not gross at all!

488
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,293
全然汚くないです。
It's not gross at all.

489
00:33:41,293 --> 00:33:44,293
影山汁（かげやまじる）汚くないです、誰がうんちですか。
Kageyama-juice is not gross. Who's calling it poop?

490
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:47,593
おお、ちょっとということでね、もう増えました。
Oh, anyway, it's increased.

491
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:49,293
あー、よかったよかった。
Ah, good, good.

492
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:50,893
ありがとうございます。これで満足か？
Thank you. Are you satisfied with this?

493
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:52,293
満足。
Satisfied.

494
00:33:52,293 --> 00:33:54,593
ありがとう、ありがとう。汁出せてよかったわ。
Thank you, thank you. Glad I could give you my juice.

495
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:57,093
はい、ということでね。
Okay, so.

496
00:33:57,093 --> 00:34:00,093
まあ、この、この後ね、まだまだいっぱいあるけど。
Well, after this, there's still more to come.

497
00:34:00,093 --> 00:34:05,593
今回はね、この後めちゃめちゃスペシャルプログラムというのが、あるんですよ。
But this time, after this, we have a very special program.

498
00:34:05,593 --> 00:34:07,593
おおー。
Oh.

499
00:34:06,593 --> 00:34:10,093
プレシャススペシャルプログラム、バラエティ。
Precious Special Program Variety.

500
00:34:10,093 --> 00:34:11,293
バラエティ。
Variety.

501
00:34:11,293 --> 00:34:13,293
はい、楽しみだね。
Yes, looking forward to it.

502
00:34:13,293 --> 00:34:15,593
ということで、またね！
So, see you later!

503
00:34:15,593 --> 00:34:17,593
準備してくるからちょっと待ってね。ありがとう！
I'm going to get ready, so please wait a bit. Thank you!

504
00:34:17,593 --> 00:34:19,593
ありがとう！こちらこそ。またね。
Thank you! Same here. See you!

505
00:34:19,593 --> 00:34:22,593
ありがとう、またねー！
Thank you, see you!

506
00:34:39,093 --> 00:34:41,593
はい、ということでね、準備もオッケーなので。
Okay, so, now that preparations are done...

507
00:34:41,593 --> 00:34:44,293
今日は、ゲスト、呼ぶかな？
I'm going to call the guests now, shall I?

508
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:47,093
じゃあ、呼びましょう。
Let's call them then.

509
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:50,093
オッケー、ゲスト、カモン！
Okay, guests, come on!

510
00:34:50,093 --> 00:34:53,093
はい、集合だー！
Okay, everyone gather up!

511
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:06,738
ということで今日はね。
So today,

512
00:35:05,805 --> 00:35:19,338
Iofi Hospitality! Food Review!
～イオフィが皆をおもてなし！食レポ回！～
Iofi Hospitality! Food Review!
~Iofi treats everyone! Food review segment!~

513
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:11,938
みんなおもてなし！食レポ回です！
everyone, it's a hospitality food review segment!

514
00:35:12,438 --> 00:35:19,071
今日はねみんなにめちゃくちゃめちゃくちゃの
おもてなしをするんで、楽しみにしてて下さい。
I'm going to treat you all so well today,
so please look forward to it.

515
00:35:19,938 --> 00:35:22,171
誕生日なのはイオフィなのに...
Even though it's Iofi's birthday...

516
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:24,571
そうだよ、私たちが。私たちが、おもてなしを...
That's right, we should... we should be the ones treating you...

517
00:35:26,671 --> 00:35:28,105
いいえいいえ、大丈夫大丈夫。
No, no, it's okay.

518
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:33,305
これ関係ないよね？この12345...
This isn't related, right? These 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

519
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:35,438
あ、なんかあるよ。
Oh, there's something.

520
00:35:35,505 --> 00:35:37,438
なんかあるよ。
There's something.

521
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:43,238
そう、後ろにも7つぐらいの箱があるけど、
中身はイオフィもさっぱりわかんない。嘘です。
Yeah, there are about 7 boxes behind me,
but I have no idea what's inside. Just kidding.

522
00:35:44,305 --> 00:35:47,005
わかんないの？
プレゼントがいっぱいあるのかな？
You don't know? 
Maybe there are lots of presents?

523
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:53,138
プレゼントがいっぱいあるのかも後ろに。
行こうかじゃあ。
Maybe there are lots of presents behind us.
Shall we go?

524
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:56,905
私たちのプレゼントじゃない？
Aren't they presents for us?

525
00:35:57,205 --> 00:35:58,905
食レポって言ってたよね？
She said it was a food review, didn't she?

526
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:02,605
中身はねちゃんと食べられるものだから大丈夫。
The contents are things you can eat, so it's fine.

527
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:07,538
食べれる、食べれないの入ってたら困っちゃうよ。
If there's stuff we can't eat, we'll be in trouble.

528
00:36:08,671 --> 00:36:12,871
イオフィがインドネシアからわざわざ持ってきて
くれたものがここに入ってるよね。
The stuff Iofi brought all the way from Indonesia 
is in here, right?

529
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,438
じゃあうちらはこの1から7を指定して、
食べればいいんですね。
So we just pick 1 through 7 and eat them, right?

530
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:23,105
絶対美味しいんだろうな。ワクワクしてきたな。
I bet it'll be delicious. I'm getting excited.

531
00:36:25,671 --> 00:36:29,705
あそこにあるゴミ箱は何だ？イオフィ。
What are those trash cans over there, Iofi?

532
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,538
この左と右もね。ゴミ箱というか...
Those on the left and right... they're not really trash cans...

533
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:36,671
ペンキ缶？
Paint cans?

534
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:41,438
ちょっとね、ちょっとでも食べられない
ものだったら、ここに放り込んでください。
Well, if there's anything you really can't eat,
please throw it in here.

535
00:36:42,105 --> 00:36:43,205
なるほどね。
I see.

536
00:36:44,305 --> 00:36:47,438
ここに青色とピンク色があるから、
お好みに選んでください。
There's blue and pink, so pick your favorite.

537
00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:50,605
いいの？このパレットみたいな使い道して。
Is it okay to use them like palettes?

538
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:55,438
いいよいいよ、わざわざ可愛く
してもらってるから。
It's fine, I had them made to look 
cute on purpose.

539
00:36:56,305 --> 00:36:58,371
使ってください。
Please use them.

540
00:36:59,105 --> 00:37:01,405
使いたいけど、使いたくないけど...
I want to use them, but I also don't...

541
00:37:02,238 --> 00:37:05,205
イオフィはこれはベールズにあれか、ベジマイトで...
Iofi, for Baelz, is it Vegemite...?

542
00:37:05,738 --> 00:37:09,271
あれ不味かったのもある、なんて言ったっけ？
That was gross too, what was it called again?

543
00:37:11,538 --> 00:37:15,038
ベジマイトは美味しいもんですよ。
だからその企画やったの、これ。
Vegemite is delicious. 
That's why we did that project, this one.

544
00:37:16,871 --> 00:37:19,005
なるほどね。じゃあ箱、全部食べて。
I see. Well then, eat all the boxes.

545
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:22,605
食べる、全部。食べます！
I'll eat them, all of them. I'll eat them!

546
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:27,805
頑張れ！頑張れ！
Good luck! Good luck!

547
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:32,505
誰から行く？じゃあポルカ行こうかな。
Who goes first? Let's go with Polka.

548
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:37,438
ポルカね、目の前にちょうどあるもの、箱が。
Polka, I've got a box right in front of me.

549
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:42,605
このナンバーワン、ナンバーワン。
ナンバーワンから行くからね。
This number one, number one.
I'm starting with number one.

550
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:45,438
ナンバーワン。
Number one.

551
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:47,938
イオフィ、ナンバーワンはどんな感じなんですか？
匂いがするとか。
Iofi, what's number one like?
Like, does it smell?

552
00:37:48,438 --> 00:37:51,638
正直ね、わかんない。全然匂いもしないしわかんない。
To be honest, I don't know.
It doesn't smell at all, so I don't know.

553
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:54,505
匂いがしないから、じゃあナンバーワン！
It doesn't smell, so, number one!

554
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:56,671
ナンバーワン、オープン！タダーン！
Number one, open! Ta-da!

555
00:37:57,405 --> 00:38:00,705
何これ？なんだこれ？
What's this? What is it?

556
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:07,105
ブルム
Brem
Brem

557
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:02,938
これはね、ブルムですよ。ブルム。
This is Brem. Brem.

558
00:38:04,371 --> 00:38:06,705
ちゃんとしたお菓子なので。
It's a proper snack.

559
00:38:07,238 --> 00:38:09,271
美味しそうじゃない。これ分かる？
Doesn't it look good? Do you know this?

560
00:38:10,105 --> 00:38:12,438
分かる、初めて見た。分からん。
I do. First time seeing it. I don't.

561
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:16,338
じゃあちょっといただきます。あーん。どう？
Well, I'll give it a try. Ahhh. How is it?

562
00:38:17,538 --> 00:38:20,605
一応ね、イオフィは苦手なのよ。
By the way, I personally don't like it.

563
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:23,105
苦手なんだ！
You don't like it!

564
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:26,671
美味しい！美味しい！あ、でも、ほら、
他の皆も気になったらどうぞ。
It's good! It's good! Oh, but, look, 
if everyone else is curious, go ahead.

565
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:31,338
いいよ、いいよ。1つお菓子。
Sure, go ahead. One snack.

566
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:35,405
じゃあ食べますわ。何これ？甘いけど。
Then I'll eat it. What's this? It's sweet.

567
00:38:36,271 --> 00:38:39,205
いただきます。なんか後半から
しょっぱみが出てくる。
Thank you. It gets kind of salty at the end.

568
00:38:40,171 --> 00:38:43,438
あ、ね。食べようかな。結構ボソボソしてて。
Oh, right. I think I'll try it. 
It's quite dry and crumbly.

569
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:47,571
日本で言うところの落雁に、ちょっと食感が近い。
The texture is a bit like Japanese rakugan.

570
00:38:48,438 --> 00:38:51,405
なるほど。これね、一応スタッフさんも
食べるんですけど...
I see. Staff members eat this too, but...

571
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:57,205
スタッフさんから言うと、なんか甘酒っぽい
味がするっていう。
Staff say it tastes kind of like amazake.

572
00:38:58,305 --> 00:39:02,271
確かに。ちょっとさっき分かるとか言ったんだけど、
全然嘘でした。
True. I said I knew what it was earlier,
but that was a total lie.

573
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:06,205
全然違うもんだった。すみません。
It was something completely different. I'm sorry.

574
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:08,671
そんなことある？じゃあこれ初めてってことね。
How does that even happen? So it's your first time.

575
00:39:09,438 --> 00:39:12,271
初めて。どうだ？美味しい？
First time. How is it? Is it good?

576
00:39:13,338 --> 00:39:17,238
なんか不思議。不思議だよね。甘酸っぱい。
It's kind of mysterious. It's strange, isn't it? 
Sweet and sour.

577
00:39:18,171 --> 00:39:22,171
甘酸っぱいよね。イオフィは自分的にこの
カサカサのカサパサ感が、あまり好きじゃなかったから...
Sweet and sour, right. Iofi said she personally 
didn't like the dry, crumbly texture...

578
00:39:24,105 --> 00:39:27,605
好きじゃないのも持ってきている。
I'm even bringing things I don't like.

579
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:31,338
好き嫌いが分かれるのかも。
おもてなしありがとうございます。
Maybe it's an acquired taste. 
Thanks for the hospitality.

580
00:39:32,238 --> 00:39:34,605
ごちそうさまです。あ、次、誰が行きますか？
Thanks for the treat. Who's next?

581
00:39:36,671 --> 00:39:40,105
勇気ある者。勇気ある者。勇気ある者！
A brave soul. A brave soul. A brave soul!

582
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:44,305
おお！行くよ。やったー。
Oh! I'll go. Yay!

583
00:39:45,171 --> 00:39:48,505
好きな数字があるんだ。
好きな数字はなんだと思う？
I have a favorite number.
What do you think my favorite number is?

584
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:52,438
めんどくさいなあ。4、4、6、6...
How bothersome. 4, 4, 6, 6...

585
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:59,105
誕生日がね、6月6日だからね。
ツノっぽいから6。
Because my birthday is June 6th.
And 6 looks like a horn.

586
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:01,417
すっぱいから、6お願いします！
Since it's sour, 6 please!

587
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:02,617
おー、お願いします！
Oh, please do!

588
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:04,117
オープン！
Open!

589
00:40:04,117 --> 00:40:05,617
うわー、何これー？
Wow, what is this?

590
00:40:05,617 --> 00:40:08,617
色やばそう！あ、これやばいやつだ！
The color looks bad! Oh, this is a bad one!

591
00:40:06,117 --> 00:40:10,117
タマリン
Tamarin
Tamarin

592
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:11,617
やばいやばい！助けて！
Crazy, crazy! Help!

593
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:15,117
これキャンディーなんですよ、キャンディー。タマリンのキャンディー。
This is candy, candy. Tamarin candy.

594
00:40:15,217 --> 00:40:16,917
名前もやばい。
The name is crazy too.

595

00:48:04,629 --> 00:48:07,629
グミっぽいのかな？ 飴？
Is it gummy-like? Candy?

731
00:48:07,629 --> 00:48:10,629
あ、飴。パキって。あ、硬い。
Ah, candy. It crunched. Ah, it's hard.

732
00:48:10,629 --> 00:48:12,129
お、どう？ どんな感じ？
Oh, how is it? What's it like?

733
00:48:12,129 --> 00:48:16,329
あ、あ、あ、すごいねスースーする感じの。
Ah, ah, ah, it's amazing, it has a cool, minty feeling.

734
00:48:17,129 --> 00:48:19,629
何だ？ スースー系。えっとね、スースー系だね。
What is it? A cool type. Umm, it's the minty type.

735
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:22,929
ミント系。爽やかでめっちゃ良さそうじゃなくてよかったかも。
Minty. It might be good that it wasn't just 'refreshing and really good'.

736
00:48:23,129 --> 00:48:25,929
綿芽は逆にスースーするの苦手だから...
Watame, on the other hand, isn't good with minty things...

737
00:48:26,129 --> 00:48:28,929
あー、じゃあドリアンでよかったんじゃない。
Ah, then wasn't it good you got durian?

738
00:48:29,129 --> 00:48:31,329
すごいサクッとしてる感じで美味しい。
It's amazing, it has a crunchy feel and is delicious.

739
00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:33,129
ドリアンどうぞ。
Here, have some durian.

740
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:36,629
綿芽のいろに... 綿芽のいろに...
Watame's color... Watame's color...

741
00:48:37,129 --> 00:48:40,129
飴残ってる、まだ。まだ残ってるの？
There's candy left, still. Is there still some left?

742
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:43,129
じゃあ一緒に食べよう。
Then, let's eat together.

743
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:46,129
一緒に行こうね。一緒に行こう。
Let's go together. Let's go.

744
00:48:46,129 --> 00:48:48,629
乾杯！
Cheers!

745
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:51,629
うわー！ おー！
Whoa! Oh!

746
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,129
うわ、どう？ 大丈夫？
Whoa, how is it? You okay?

747
00:48:54,129 --> 00:48:56,329
くっさ！
It stinks!

748
00:48:56,629 --> 00:49:00,129
くっさがでた。先輩大丈夫？ 先輩行ったぞ！
The 'stinky' came out. Are you okay, Senpai? Senpai is down!

749
00:49:00,129 --> 00:49:03,329
ポルカ！ ポルカ！ ドリアンだめか... だめか。
Polka! Polka! Durian is no good... no good.

750
00:49:03,329 --> 00:49:08,629
だめか、ポルカ。
No good, Polka.

751
00:49:08,629 --> 00:49:12,629
死んどる... ポルカが死んどる！ ポルカ！ ポルカ！
She's dead... Polka is dead! Polka! Polka!

752
00:49:12,629 --> 00:49:15,629
そんなに？ そんなにやばいの？
That much? Is it that bad?

753
00:49:15,629 --> 00:49:18,629
分かるよ。あー、なるほどね。
I get it. Ah, I see.

754
00:49:18,629 --> 00:49:22,629
あー、なるほど。いやおもてなしすごいわこれ。
Ah, I see. Wow, this hospitality is amazing.

755
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,629
うわー、キツイ。ちょっと気になる。やってみる？
Uwa, it's tough. Hey, I'm curious. Want to try?

756
00:49:28,629 --> 00:49:31,129
べーちゃんやってみる？
Bae-chan, want to try?

757
00:49:31,129 --> 00:49:34,129
べーちゃんも食べてみて、そのサワーソップ... じゃなくて。
Bae-chan, you try it too, that soursop... I mean.

758
00:49:34,129 --> 00:49:36,329
一緒に食べた、うわー！
They ate it together, whoa!

759
00:49:36,629 --> 00:49:42,629
綿芽！ 綿芽！
Watame! Watame!

760
00:49:42,629 --> 00:49:46,329
違うの、ドリアンキャンディは悪くないの、悪くないかもしれない。
No, the durian candy isn't bad, it might not be bad.

761
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:50,129
ちょっと大きさがね、大きさがもっと小さい方がよかったかもしれないから。
Maybe the size? The size, it might have been better if it were smaller.

762
00:49:50,129 --> 00:49:53,129
あ、でもね。
Ah, but well.

763
00:49:54,129 --> 00:49:56,629
見てただけ。ふん。
I was just watching. Hmph.

764
00:49:57,929 --> 00:50:01,129
はい、ということでね。
Okay, so with that.

765
00:50:00,141 --> 00:53:26,141
Iofi Hospitality! Food Review!

I'm going! Iofi, you're curious, aren't you?

799
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:54,141
気になるだろ？イオフィ、何だと思う？
Curious, right? Iofi, what do you think it is?

800
00:51:54,141 --> 00:51:57,141
ベジマイトかな？どうかな？気になる、ベジマイト。
Maybe Vegemite? I wonder? I'm curious about Vegemite.

801
00:51:57,141 --> 00:52:00,141
じゃ、何かな？ 何かな？
Well, what is it? What is it?

Eh, this is for today, but I'm so nervous I'm shaking.

806
00:52:19,141 --> 00:52:22,141
プルプルしてる。ちょっと待って、ちょっと待って。
Shaking. Wait a second, wait a second.

807
00:52:22,141 --> 00:52:27,141
持たせてもらった方がいい。見せてあげて。すごいでしょう。
It's better to let her hold it. Show her. Amazing, right?

Important. Thank you. Aah, or...

810
00:52:33,141 --> 00:52:37,141
そらちゃんが「あーん」してくれるんじゃない、もしかして。
Sora-chan is going to feed you, isn't she?

811
00:52:37,141 --> 00:52:40,141
あら、大丈夫。生クリームがちょっと取れないけど、
Oh, it's okay. I can't quite get the whipped cream off, but...

812
00:52:40,141 --> 00:52:44,141
どうすればいいんだ。あ、果物、あ、ありがとう。

00:54:12,141 --> 00:54:16,141
いや、本当にありがとうね。今日集まらなかったらどうしようと思って。
No, really, thank you. I was worried what to do if they didn't gather today.

838
00:54:17,141 --> 00:54:21,141
So, I don't know. I mean, we have a lot of colors here.

842
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:39,141
Tapi ya, kalau ini kita semua dicampurin, diiniin...
But you know, if we mixed all of these together, do this...

843
00:54:39,141 --> 00:54:42,141
Gimana ya?
I wonder how it would be?

844
00:54:42,141 --> 00:54:47,141
え、これ全部混ぜたらどうなるんだろうね？
Uh, what would happen if we mixed all of these?

845
00:54:47,141 --> 00:54:51,141
Let's try! Want to try? Want to try mixing all of the colors?

846
00:54:51,141 --> 00:54:54,141

Here I am

1005
01:05:58,177 --> 01:06:00,417
I am here waiting for you

1006
01:06:00,697 --> 01:06:04,897
今日もずっとそばにいる
I'll be by your side today and always.
