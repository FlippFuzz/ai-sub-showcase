There is no R whatsoever.

140
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:34,424
どこから話せばいいんだろう 待ちくたびれても
Where should I start talking, even if I'm tired of waiting

141
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:41,224
終わりだなんて言わせないから
Because I won't let you say it's the end

142
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:48,724
書き殴った無意識の衝動を連れて
Taking along the scribbled unconscious impulses

143
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:56,124
何もかも壊したら不可能を始めればいいんだ
If you break everything, you just have to start the impossible

There's a reason that we came across in this world

145
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:14,924
There's a reason that we call magnetic world

146
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:21,924
響き続け合う 世界はどこへ
Where is the world that continues to resonate with each other going

147
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:29,324
愛のために泣けるのは 君がそこにいるから
Being able to cry for the sake of love is because you are there

148
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:36,424
君だけを呼び続けるから
Because I'll keep calling only you

149
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:43,624
愛のために歌うのは そして共に生きること
Singing for the sake of love is also about living together

150
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:51,324
ずっと 君と
Forever, with you

151
00:17:54,674 --> 00:18:00,824
青色した空となみひとつない鏡のよう…な
The blue sky and like a mirror without a single wave...

152
00:18:07,274 --> 00:18:08,574
海を見てた
Watching the sea

153
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:14,324
どんな場所に立って どんな形になって
No matter where you stand, no matter what shape you take

154
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:17,424
どんな時代に立って
No matter what era it is,

155
00:18:17,424 --> 00:18:21,624
見つけ出すよ より速く 宙吊りにした 運命に逆らって
I'll find you faster, defying the fate that was put into the air

156
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:30,324
There's a reason that we came across in this world

157
00:18:33,774 --> 00:18:40,024
There's a reason that we call magnetic world

158
00:18:40,474 --> 00:18:47,324
引き寄せ合う 二人はどこへ
Where are the two of us, who are drawn to each other, going

159
00:18:48,324 --> 00:18:55,124
愛のために進むのは 君がそこにいるから
Moving forward for the sake of love is because you are there

160
00:18:55,674 --> 00:19:02,324
僕だけが君を護るから
Because only I will protect you

161
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:09,524
愛のために願うのは そして誰も傷つけずに
Praying for the sake of love, and without hurting anyone

162
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:17,224
ずっと 隣で
Forever, by your side

163
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:37,724
僕らは超えて行く 全ての憎しみを
We will overcome all the hatred

164
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:47,424
偽物の正義など 捨ててしまえ
Throw away things like fake justice

165
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:55,924
愛のために泣けるのは 君がそこにいるから
Being able to cry for the sake of love is because you are there

166
00:19:56,574 --> 00:20:00,024
We will always...

167
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,032
Together...

168
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:05,432
Together...

169
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:11,482
愛のために進むのは
The reason I move forward for the sake of love

170
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:15,532
君とここにいるから
Is because I am here with you

171
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:19,482
僕だけが
Because I am the only one

172
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:22,532
君を守るから
Who will protect you

173
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:26,932
愛のために願うのは
What I wish for the sake of love

174
00:20:26,932 --> 00:20:31,032
そして共に生き抜くこと
Is to survive together

175
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:34,532
ずっと together
Always together

176
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:38,282
Believe...

177
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:43,032
Together...

178
00:20:43,132 --> 00:20:46,032
Together...

179
00:21:15,182 --> 00:21:18,532
イオフィ、お誕生日おめでとう！
Yoppi, happy birthday!

180
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:20,532
ありがとう！
Thank you!

181
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:24,332
やっと！今年も来てくれてありがとう！
We did it! Thanks for coming again this year!

182
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:29,032
え～どうもこんにちは、ときのそらです。
よろしくお願いします！
Hello, everyone, I'm Tokino Sora.
Nice to meet you!

183
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:31,532
こちら。へへへ。
And I'm over here. Hehehe.

184
00:21:33,632 --> 00:21:36,432
や～なんかね、バラード歌っちゃったね。
We really sang a ballad, didn't we?

185
00:21:36,632 --> 00:21:38,232
ね～
We did!

186
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:42,832
より私すごい気になってるんだけど、なんなんこの…（笑）
But more than that, I'm really curious about...
what even is this? (Laughs)

187
00:21:43,532 --> 00:21:45,032
こたつ…？
A kotatsu...?

188
00:21:45,132 --> 00:21:48,832
いいえ、宇宙寒いからこれ温かいよ。
No, since space is cold, this keeps us warm.

189
00:21:49,032 --> 00:21:52,532
え～宇宙で焚き火なんてできるんだね。
Wow, you can actually have a campfire in space.

190
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:54,032
できるよ一応。
Well, technically you can.

191
00:21:54,132 --> 00:21:56,132
だって酸素があるってことだ！
That means there's oxygen!

192
00:21:56,232 --> 00:22:00,032
あ、でもでも、酸素いるからさ、
今のこれバリアいるから。
Ah, but since we need oxygen,
there's a barrier here right now.

193
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:03,032
バリアおるからね。
Because there's a barrier, you see.

194
00:22:03,132 --> 00:22:06,532
酸素ないから、ないんだったらもう耐えないじゃん。
Since there's no oxygen,
we wouldn't last if we didn't have it.

195
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:08,532
あ～そうだね。そうだね。
Ah, that's true. That's true.

196
00:22:09,032 --> 00:22:11,832
うん、そう。温かいよ、これ。
Right. This is warm.

197
00:22:12,032 --> 00:22:12,832
イオフィさ、なんか…
You know, Yoppi...

198
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,532
何何？
Yes?

199
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:18,032
MCでこんなにまったり焚き火の前で、こう…
Having an MC segment where we're
relaxing in front of a campfire...

200
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:22,532
なんか夜のなんか二人で喋っちゃうみたいな雰囲気で…
...it feels like we're just two people chatting at night.

201
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,832
やることないよ。ないから、ちょっと変な感じがする。
We don't usually do this. It feels a bit strange.

202
00:22:26,332 --> 00:22:29,032
あ～そうだね、普通にさ、ポーズしたあとにこう…
Ah, that's true. Usually, after doing a pose...

203
00:22:29,132 --> 00:22:32,432
「あ！ありがとう！歌ったね！」って言うじゃん。
...we'd be like, "Ah! Thank you! We sang that!" right?

204
00:22:32,532 --> 00:22:34,532
ね！すぐそうだよね。
Right! That's how it usually goes.

205
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:37,032
すぐだけど、やっぱり今年のテーマもっと緩いとかも…
It's immediate, but this year's theme is more "mellow"...

206
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:40,032
落ち着く雰囲気欲しいから、
...and I wanted a more relaxed atmosphere...

207
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:43,032
そのダンスとあの歌のあとにちょ…
...so after the dance and that song...

208
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:46,532
マイクをね、ちょっと落としてここに座ってるっていう。ね。
...we just set down the mics and sat here. You know?

209
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,032
でもいいね。
But it's nice.

210
00:22:49,132 --> 00:22:52,532
なんかまったりできるから、ちょっとのんびりして
お喋りできる感じ、いいと思う。すごく。
Since we can relax and chat at our own pace.
I think it's really good.

211
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:55,832
やったやった！
Yay!

212
00:22:56,532 --> 00:23:00,032
でね、今年誕生日にあの二回ぐらい歌んだよね。
And you know, I've had you sing for
my birthday twice already.

213
00:23:00,232 --> 00:23:01,832
毎年。そう。
Every year, really.

214
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:03,532
今年…ん？去年も？
This year... wait, last year too?

215
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,532
あ、去年とおととしとってこと？
Ah, you mean last year and the year before?

216
00:23:05,632 --> 00:23:07,032
そうそうそう。
Yes, yes, yes.

217
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:09,032
今年で、来年も来る？
So this year too. Will you come next year?

218
00:23:09,332 --> 00:23:13,532
え、もちろんもちろんよ！呼んでもらえればいつでも行くよ！
Oh, of course, of course!
If you invite me, I'll come anytime!

219
00:23:13,732 --> 00:23:16,832
お！やった！じゃ決定で。（笑）
Oh! Yay! Then it's decided! (Laughs)

220
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:18,532
やった～！
Yay!

221
00:23:18,632 --> 00:23:22,532
そしたらなんかもうこの去年と今年も結構
ハンドマイクであのやってるから…
Since both last year and this year we've been
using hand mics...

222
00:23:22,732 --> 00:23:24,532
そうだね、結構…
True, we have.

223
00:23:24,732 --> 00:23:29,032
そうそう。聴かせるみたいな感じの曲ばかりだったじゃない？
They've both been the kind of songs
meant for listening, right?

224
00:23:29,232 --> 00:23:32,432
じゃ来年はバリバリ踊ります？そしたら。
So, shall we dance our hearts out next year?

225
00:23:32,632 --> 00:23:34,532
踊る～！
Let's dance!

226
00:23:34,632 --> 00:23:35,532
うおお～！
Woah!

227
00:23:35,632 --> 00:23:38,232
いいね。踊りやっぱりね、大好き。踊り。
Sounds good. I really love dancing, after all.

228
00:23:38,532 --> 00:23:40,032
大好き！
I love it too!

229
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:41,032
イオフィは？
How about you, Yoppi?

230
00:23:41,132 --> 00:23:42,532
好き好き好き！
I love it, love it, love it!

231
00:23:42,732 --> 00:23:44,232
ね、いいよね。
Right, it's great.

232
00:23:44,432 --> 00:23:47,032
や、でもさなんか今年のさテーマさっきも聞いて
バラードだって聞いて…
But you know, when I heard this year's theme
was ballads...

233
00:23:47,232 --> 00:23:51,532
やっぱさバラードのさ、全体をさ、ライブするのって
すごい難しいなって私は思っちゃうの。
I really feel like doing a whole live show with only
ballads is actually quite difficult.

234
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:54,832
ほ？
Oh?

235
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:58,532
やっぱ演出とかもそうだけどさ、
The staging and everything else aside...

236
00:23:58,732 --> 00:24:02,532
やっぱ私はいつもダンスとかで見せるみたいなのやるから、
...since I usually focus on "showing" through dance...

237
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:06,532
バラードで挑戦するのってすごいなって思っててさ。
...I think it's amazing to take on the challenge
of a ballad.

238
00:24:06,832 --> 00:24:10,532
あ～、そう、でもなんか自分にとってはあのバラードが
あの一番声に似合うから。
Ah... well, for me, I feel ballads suit my voice the best.

239
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:12,532
あ、ね。
Ah, I see.

240
00:24:12,732 --> 00:24:16,832
そう、なんかもっと見せたいな～とは思ってて。
So I've been wanting to show that more.

241
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,532
そ、だからね。
Yeah, so...

242
00:24:19,732 --> 00:24:21,532
お、ほら見える！いっぱい！
Oh, look! There's so many!

243
00:24:21,732 --> 00:24:24,032
うわ～！綺麗～宇宙！
Wow! Space is so beautiful!

244
00:24:24,232 --> 00:24:27,532
宇宙に来ました。あの去年もちょっとい…
一応は宇宙にいたんだけど、
We've arrived in space. Last year we were also
technically in space...

245
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:31,032
あんまり見えないかもしれないですね。
...but you might not have been able to see it as well.

246
00:24:31,132 --> 00:24:35,832
だから今年はちゃんと宇宙に行きたいですって。
So this year, I really wanted us to go to
space properly.

247
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:41,032
わ～すごい！宇宙来ました、二人で。
Wow, amazing! The two of us have come to space.

248
00:24:41,132 --> 00:24:42,532
すごい！
It's amazing!

249
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:45,532
あ、綺麗本当に。
Ah, it's really beautiful.

250
00:24:45,732 --> 00:24:49,032
お、なんか姉さんと似合うじゃん？
Hey, doesn't it suit you, Sora-neesan?

251
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:50,032
本当？
Really?

252
00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:53,032
そう、なんか普通にイメージカラーが青だから。
Yeah, since your image color is blue.

253
00:24:53,132 --> 00:24:54,532
ね。
Right.

254
00:24:54,632 --> 00:24:57,032
ほら、合うの、ステージもこっちも。うん。
See, it matches both the stage and the surroundings.

255
00:24:57,232 --> 00:24:59,032
え、いいな。可愛いな～。へへへ。
Hehe, that's nice. It's so cute. Hehehe.

256
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,540
撮った撮った！
Got them! Got them!

257
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,540
似合ってるでしょ？ほら、めっちゃ可愛い。
It looks good on me, right? Look, it's so cute.

258
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,040
ふわふわして。
It's so fluffy.

259
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,540
おぉ！可愛い！
Oh! How cute!

260
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,540
もっと見せて。
Show me more.

261
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,840
あ…あれ？これ私の記念日じゃないんだ。
Wait... oh? This isn't my anniversary.

262
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,540
そうだね。
That's right.

263
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,540
ヤッピー！
Yappii!

264
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,240
ヤッピー！
Yappii!

265
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,040
大丈夫だよ。はい。
It's okay. Here.

266
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,540
いっぱい撮りました。オフショ。
I took lots of photos. Off-shots.

267
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,840
はい、ということで今回ね、まだまだいるので、
All right, well, there's still more to come this time,

268
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,240
皆さんも楽しみにしてくださいね。
so everyone, please look forward to it.

269
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,040
ねぇ～本当におめでとうだよ！
Yeah~ really, congratulations!

270
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,240
では来年また歌って踊ろうね。
Then, let's sing and dance together again next year.

271
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,540
踊ろう！
Let's!

272
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
さあ、それでは皆さんありがとう！
Now then, thank you everyone!

273
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,540
ありがとうございました！
Thank you very much!

274
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,040
またね！バイバイ！
See you again! Bye bye!

275
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,040
幸せになって
Be Happy

276
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,240
なんども 問いかけた
I've asked myself many times

277
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,040
自問自答 繰り返した先に
after repeating these inner dialogues

278
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,840
答えが あるのなら
if there is an answer

279
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,240
このまま 探してみようか
shall we try searching like this?

280
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,840
あなたの 未来図に
In your vision of the future,

281
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,240
私は 少しでもいれたかな
I wonder if I was there, even a little.

282
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,040
あなたの いない世界は
A world without you,

283
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:47,840
想像さえ つかなかった
I couldn't even imagine it.

284
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,240
もしも あなたが
If you,

285
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,040
あの子を 選んだ瞬間に
at the moment you chose her,

286
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,040
私が 頭の中
if I was running through

287
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:09,540
駆け巡っていたのなら 悔しいな
your mind, that would be frustrating.

288
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,040
こんなにも あなたのこと
Before I ended up loving

289
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,040
好きになってしまう前に せめてさあ
you this much, at least...

290
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:27,040
さよならの言葉 避けてほしかったな
I wanted you to avoid those words of goodbye.

291
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,040
なんて勝手な わがままだよね
What a selfish thing to ask, isn't it?

292
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,040
誰よりも 想ってるのに
Even though I care for you more than anyone,

293
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,040
あなたを世界で一番笑顔に
the one who can make you smile

294
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:51,040
変えられる人は きっと私じゃないから
most in the world is surely not me.

295
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,540
どうか 幸せになって
Please, be happy.

296
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,540
どんなに 願っても
No matter how much I wish,

297
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,540
変わりはしない この現実が
this reality that won't change

298
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,040
ただただ 目の前の
just took away

299
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,540
光すべて 奪い去った
all the light before my eyes.

300
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,040
生まれ変わっても
Even if I were reborn,

301
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,040
もう一度 あなたに恋するかな
I wonder if I'd fall in love with you again.

302
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,240
そんな 妄想なんて
Even thinking about

303
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,540
考えることすらも 馬鹿みたい
such fantasies is foolish.

304
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,240
こんなにも あなたのこと
Before I ended up loving

305
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:59,040
好きになってしまう前に わざとさあ
you this much, intentionally...

306
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,240
優しい言葉で 勘違いさせないで
don't make me misunderstand with kind words.

307
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,540
なんて勝手な わがままだよね
What a selfish thing to ask, isn't it?

308
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,240
あなたの 幸せと笑う
Just by seeing your happy,

309
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:19,540
顔を見るだけで 胸いっぱいになる
smiling face, my heart becomes full.

310
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:28,540
あなたと私は きっとお似合いじゃないから
Because you and I surely don't suit each other,

311
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,240
どうか 幸せになって
please, be happy.

312
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,540
涙出るのは
The reason I'm crying

313
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,540
嘘でも 強がるから
is because I'm acting tough even if it's a lie.

314
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,040
気づかない ふりしないで
Don't pretend not to notice,

315
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,240
どうしても 諦められないよ
I just can't give up on you,

316
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,540
おわりだというのに
even though it's the end.

317
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,540
こんなにも あなたのこと
I love you so much...

318
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:03,948
好きになってしまう前に　せめてさ
Before I fall in love with you, at least...

319
00:30:05,148 --> 00:30:09,948
サヨナラの言葉　告げてほしかったなんて
I wanted you to say goodbye...

320
00:30:10,748 --> 00:30:14,948
勝手で我儘だよね
It's selfish and willful, isn't it?

321
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:21,148
こんなにもあなたのこと
Before I fall in love with you this much,

322
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:26,148
好きになってしまう前に　せめてさ
at least...

323
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:31,148
サヨナラの言葉　告げてほしかったなんて
I wanted you to say goodbye...

324
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:36,148
勝手で我儘だよね
It's selfish and willful, isn't it?

325
00:30:37,348 --> 00:30:43,148
誰より思ってるのに　あなたを世界で
Even though I care more than anyone, you in this world...

326
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:46,848
一番笑顔に
...the one most likely to make you smile...

327
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:51,348
変えられるのはきっと
...is surely...

328
00:30:51,948 --> 00:30:56,348
私じゃないから
...not me.

329
00:30:57,148 --> 00:31:03,148
どうか幸せになって
Please, be happy.

330
00:31:03,748 --> 00:31:07,348
幸せになって
Be happy.

331
00:31:19,348 --> 00:31:21,148
あ、みんな来てくれてありがとう！
Ah, everyone, thank you for coming!

332
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:22,348
誕生日おめでとう！
Happy birthday!

333
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:24,048
ありがとう！嬉しい！イェーイ！
Thank you! I'm so happy! Yay!

334
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:28,948
嬉しい、ありがとう、おめでとう！
I'm happy, thank you, congrats!

335
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:31,048
では最初は誰から自己紹介する？
Well, first of all, who should start with the self-introductions?

336
00:31:31,048 --> 00:31:32,448
んじゃ俺からいこうかな？
Then, shall I go first?

337
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:33,048
はい！
Yes!

338
00:31:33,148 --> 00:31:36,548
はい、ホロスターズ1期生の律可です。よろしくお願いします！
Hi! I'm Rikka from Holostars 1st generation. Nice to meet you!

339
00:31:36,748 --> 00:31:38,048
イェーイ！次は？
Yay! Next?

340
00:31:38,748 --> 00:31:43,048
はい！ホロスターズグループUPROAR!!の水無世燐央です。よろしくお願いします！
Hi! I'm Minase Rio from Holostars group UPROAR!! Nice to meet you!

341
00:31:43,248 --> 00:31:44,548
お願いします！
Nice to meet you!

342
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,848
いやーいいね、一緒に歌ってくれてありがとう！
Wow, it's nice. Thank you for singing with me!

343
00:31:50,048 --> 00:31:52,348
いや、こちらこそ呼んでくれてありがとう！
No, it's us who should thank you for inviting us!

344
00:31:52,548 --> 00:31:55,148
いや、嬉しかった。ありがとうございます。
I'm so happy. Thank you very much.

345
00:31:55,348 --> 00:32:00,848
でね、なんか律可パイセンからは私がデビューの頃結構お世話になってて、私が。
And you know, Rikka-paisen has been taking care of me since my debut...

346
00:32:01,348 --> 00:32:04,948
1周年とか来てもらったりしたもんね。
Yeah, you came to my 1st anniversary and such, right?

347
00:32:05,148 --> 00:32:09,148
そうそう、なのでなんか今回歌いたいなと思ってて。
Yeah, yeah. So, I thought I really wanted to sing together this time.

348
00:32:09,448 --> 00:32:10,548
ありがとね！
Thank you!

349
00:32:10,548 --> 00:32:12,748
呼んでくれてありがとうね！
Thank you for inviting us!

350
00:32:12,948 --> 00:32:14,348
燐央くんは...
And Rio-kun...

351
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:15,548
リオリオは。
Rio-Rio...

352
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:16,148
燐央くんは...
Rio-kun is...

353
00:32:16,148 --> 00:32:17,348
後輩だもんね。
He's a junior, right?

354
00:32:17,348 --> 00:32:18,148
後輩ですよ。
I am a junior.

355
00:32:18,148 --> 00:32:19,148
そうそうそう。
Right, right.

356
00:32:19,148 --> 00:32:27,748
なんかスタジオで会った時にさ、仕事で。たまたま休憩室でなんかこう、「じゃあ次の来年の誕生日にさ、来てくれる？」って。
When we met at the studio for work, by chance we were in the break room together and I asked, 'Hey, would you come to my next birthday [3D Live]?'

357
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:31,448
そう、言ってくれて！
Yeah, you said that!

358
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:36,548
スタジオで本当にバッタリ会って、言ってくれて、まさか本当に呼んでもらえるとは思わず...
We just happened to run into each other at the studio and you asked me. I didn't think you would really call me...

359
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:38,248
えっ！信じられなかったの？
What! You didn't believe me?

360
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:42,548
いやいや、もう嬉しすぎてビックリしちゃったよ僕。ありがとうございます。
No, no, I was just so happy and surprised. Thank you.

361
00:32:42,848 --> 00:32:44,248
いいえ、いいえ、ありがとう！
No, no, thank you!

362
00:32:44,248 --> 00:32:45,648
ありがとうございます。
Thank you very much.

363
00:32:46,348 --> 00:32:48,348
僕たち揃うのが、あの、2年前以来だよね？
By the way, the three of us being together, it's been about two years?

364
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:49,248
久しぶりですね。
It's been a while, hasn't it?

365
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:50,148
2年前！
Two years ago!

366
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:56,248
ホロスターズ側のカウントダウンライブで、この3人とコボちゃんと4人で歌わせていただいたんですけど。
At the Holostars side's countdown live, the three of us plus Kobo-chan, the four of us sang together.

367
00:32:56,948 --> 00:32:58,248
一緒に歌うのは実はそれぶり。
It's actually been that long since we sang together.

368
00:32:58,248 --> 00:33:01,348
それぶり！だいぶ久しぶり。
Since then! It's been quite a while.

369
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:03,148
2年前... そう、2年前。
Two years ago... Yeah, two years ago.

370
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,148
もう2年経ったんだな。
Two years have passed already.

371
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:06,148
2年だなぁ。
Yeah, two years.

372
00:33:06,148 --> 00:33:07,248
早いなぁ。
Time flies.

373
00:33:07,248 --> 00:33:08,548
早い。早いですね。
It's fast. It's really fast.

374
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:10,848
一緒に歌えてめちゃめちゃ楽しかったです。
But singing together was really fun.

375
00:33:10,848 --> 00:33:12,348
ありがとう！本当！
Thank you! Me too!

376
00:33:12,548 --> 00:33:14,648
なんか3人バンドみたいだったよね。
Yeah, it felt like a three-person band.

377
00:33:14,848 --> 00:33:17,048
ギター一人、ギター一人！
One guitarist, one guitarist!

378
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:18,048
ボーカルと、これ、みたいな。
And vocals and such.

379
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:19,848
見たことある感じの絵面だったよね。
It was a scene I've seen before.

380
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:22,048
来年だったらもうバンドやりますよそしたら！
Next year, let's really do a band then!

381
00:33:22,148 --> 00:33:23,748
バンドね！じゃあ俺ドラムやろうかな？
A band! Then I'll do drums.

382
00:33:23,748 --> 00:33:24,748
ドラム！
Drums!

383
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:26,548
そしたらなんかいい感じじゃん。
Then it'll be good.

384
00:33:26,748 --> 00:33:28,148
じゃあ俺、トライアングルやるわ。
Then I'll play the triangle.

385
00:33:28,148 --> 00:33:29,048
え、なんで？
Wait, why?

386
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:30,348
燐央くん何やる？
Rio-kun, what will you do?

387
00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:32,048
マラカス？
Maracas?

388
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:34,348
ちょっと待って、リズム隊いらねぇって！
Wait a minute, we only have rhythm instruments!

389
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:36,148
リズム大事じゃん！
Rhythm is important!

390
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,248
ほとんどうるさいけど、ギターとかいないんだ。
It'll be noisy, but no guitar or anything?

391
00:33:38,848 --> 00:33:42,148
え、だってトライアングルとか思わなかったの？こう、チンチンチンってするときだけ。
But the triangle's 'ting ting ting' is important when it's quiet.

392
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:43,048
確かに。
That's true.

393
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:44,248
気持ちいいよ、結構。
It feels good.

394
00:33:44,248 --> 00:33:45,348
気持ちいいね。
It feels good.

395
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,348
タンバリンにしようかな。
Maybe I'll do the tambourine then.

396
00:33:47,348 --> 00:33:49,248
タンバリン、タンバリン！
Tambourine, tambourine!

397
00:33:49,248 --> 00:33:51,048
みんなうるさいやつじゃん。
Everyone is playing noisy instruments.

398
00:33:51,148 --> 00:33:52,348
シャンシャンシャン。
Shan shan shan.

399
00:33:52,348 --> 00:33:54,348
タンバリンシャンシャンシャンシャンシャン。
Tambourine shan shan shan shan shan.

400
00:33:54,448 --> 00:33:56,148
今回は結構しっとりだったから。
But this song was quite mellow.

401
00:33:56,348 --> 00:33:57,348
確かに。
That's true.

402
00:33:57,348 --> 00:33:59,248
合うか分かんないですけどね、流石にこれはね。
I don't know if [those instruments] would fit, but...

403
00:33:59,348 --> 00:34:02,148
ハモリ難しかったねやっぱり。3人だからさ。
Harmonizing was difficult after all, with three people.

404
00:34:02,348 --> 00:34:10,848
そう、なんか元々、こう男性と女性が、あの、二人で歌う曲見つけるのちょっと結構難しくて。
Yeah, finding a song for two men and one woman to sing is actually quite hard.

405
00:34:11,848 --> 00:34:12,648
キーがね。
The key...

406
00:34:12,648 --> 00:34:18,148
そう、キーが。でも女性の曲だったらキー下げなきゃいけないし、男性だったらこっちが...
Yeah, the key. If it's a female song, the men have to lower it.

407
00:34:18,148 --> 00:34:20,148
燐央くんからしたら低すぎるとか。
And if it's a male song, it's too low for you.

408
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:21,848
そう、低すぎて。だからどうしようと思って。
Yeah, it's too low. So I was wondering what to do.

409
00:34:22,148 --> 00:34:23,848
でもめちゃめちゃ素敵な曲。
But it's a really wonderful song.

410
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:25,148
原曲もいいし。
The original is also nice.

411
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:26,348
ありがと、良かった。
I'm glad. Thank you.

412
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:36,148
ゲストは、この最初には、やっぱり絶対に燐央くんと律可パイセンを招待したんだけど、その時期に曲まだ決まってなくて。
When I was deciding on guests, I definitely wanted to invite Rio-kun and Rikka-paisen first, but at that time the song wasn't decided yet.

413
00:34:37,348 --> 00:34:38,848
あ、そうなんだ。後から決まったんだ。
Oh, really? It was decided later?

414
00:34:39,148 --> 00:34:40,348
後から。そう、後から。
Later, yeah.

415
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:43,148
いいの見つけたね。
You found a good one.

416
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:48,348
ありがと！本当によかったよ。声も合ってたし、この3人の。うん。
Thank you! I'm really glad. It matched the three of us' voices too.

417
00:34:48,348 --> 00:34:52,148
めちゃめちゃよかった。本当によかった。
It was really good. It was really good.

418
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:56,148
ゲストが、ゲストが、決まって、その曲って感じね。
So, the guests were decided first, then the song.

419
00:34:56,348 --> 00:34:57,148
なるほどね。
I see.

420
00:34:57,148 --> 00:34:58,648
またやりたいけどね。
I want to do it again sometime.

421
00:34:58,648 --> 00:34:59,848
やりたい！
I want to!

422
00:35:00,376 --> 00:35:01,376
歌、また...
Let's sing again...

423
00:35:01,376 --> 00:35:02,556
ねえ、次はバンド？
Hey, next a band?

424
00:35:02,556 --> 00:35:03,956
バンドやるか！
Let's do a band!

425
00:35:03,956 --> 00:35:05,156
バンド。イオフィマラカス。
Band. Iofi maracas.

426
00:35:05,156 --> 00:35:07,456
練習時間めちゃかかりそうだけどね。
Seems like it'll take a lot of practice time though.

427
00:35:07,456 --> 00:35:08,856
確かに。イオフィドラムやったことないからね。
True. Since Iofi hasn't played drums before.

428
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,456
やるの？やるしかない！
Doing it? We have no choice but to do it!

429
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:12,556
やるなら練習しますよ。
If we're doing it, I'll practice.

430
00:35:12,556 --> 00:35:14,256
あ、じゃあ来年やります、バンド。
Ah, then we'll do it next year, the band.

431
00:35:14,256 --> 00:35:15,956
楽しみ！
Looking forward to it!

432
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,556
もうイオフィったら本当にやりそうだから。
Geez, Iofi, you really look like you'd do it.

433
00:35:18,556 --> 00:35:20,056
怖い。
Scary.

434
00:35:20,156 --> 00:35:22,856
ということで来年楽しみにしていてくださいね。
So please look forward to next year.

435
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:24,956
絶対に、本当に怖い... みんな本気にするよ。
Definitely, really scary... everyone will take it seriously.

436
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,456
みんな本気にしちゃうよこれ。
Everyone will take this seriously.

437
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:28,956
怖い怖い。
Scary, scary.

438
00:35:28,956 --> 00:35:31,456
じゃあ来年楽しみということで。
Then, looking forward to next year.

439

本当に皆見てくれてありがとう。これからもね、まだまだあるので。
Truly, thank you everyone for watching. There's still more to come.

440
00:35:35,356 --> 00:35:36,556
まだまだあるので。
There's still more.

441
00:35:36,556 --> 00:35:38,056
うん、楽しんでください。

443
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:55,056
ぼくらのレットイットビー
Our Let It Be

444
00:36:13,489 --> 00:36:18,589
生まれ変われるのなら
If we could be reborn

445
00:36:18,589 --> 00:36:23,756
目印になるから前を向いてよ
I'll be your landmark, so look forward

446
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:29,056
小指と小指の長い糸
The long thread between our pinkies

447
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:34,389
解けないように結んだの
I tied it so it wouldn't come undone

448
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:38,556
夏祭り 夜雨降り
Summer festival, night rain falls

449
00:36:40,456 --> 00:36:45,389
空に虹が掛かる
A rainbow appears in the sky

450
00:36:45,389 --> 00:36:49,056
頃なの
It's around that time

451
00:36:51,622 --> 00:36:57,022
壊れた感情じゃ いつか君を消してゆく
With broken emotions, I'll eventually erase you

452
00:36:57,022 --> 00:37:02,356
見えなくなると失われる灯火
A light that is lost when it becomes invisible

453
00:37:02,356 --> 00:37:07,489
でも結んだ長い糸 ほどけ落ちていないから
But the long thread we tied hasn't come undone

454
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:15,589
また僕たちは出会う時が来る きっと
So the time will come for us to meet again, surely

455
00:37:24,356 --> 00:37:29,556
僕ら大人になったら
When we grow up

456
00:37:29,556 --> 00:37:34,822
正義のヒーローになるんだ
We'll become heroes of justice

457
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:39,956
地球の平和を守るのさ
We'll protect the peace of the Earth

458
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:45,889
探検しようぜ お化け屋敷
Let's explore the haunted house

459
00:37:45,922 --> 00:37:51,156
でも本当は怖くて 泣き虫
But actually I'm scared, a crybaby

460
00:37:51,156 --> 00:37:59,056
一緒にいたいだけ
I just want to be together

461
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:07,556
明日は晴れて 空を仰いで照らせば
If it's sunny tomorrow and the sky shines as we look up

462
00:38:07,556 --> 00:38:12,822
僕らはここに秘密基地を作ろう
Let's build a secret base here

463
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:16,922
そして探検しよう
And let's explore

464
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:21,089
雨ならゲームしよう
If it rains, let's play games

465
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:29,056
そんな時間が ずっと続くはずだったんだ そう
Such times were supposed to last forever, yes

466
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:50,422
悪かったのは僕だった
The one who was wrong was me

467
00:38:50,422 --> 00:38:54,489
逃げ出したのは僕だった
The one who ran away was me

468
00:38:54,489 --> 00:39:02,089
嘘じゃない本当の嘘つきだ
It's not a lie, I'm a real liar

469
00:39:02,222 --> 00:39:07,356
花束に包まれて 目を瞑る君は
Wrapped in a bouquet, you who closed your eyes

470
00:39:07,356 --> 00:39:15,556
安らかに 清らかに 眠っていたんだ
Were sleeping peacefully and purely

471
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:46,356
壊れた感情が
Broken emotions

472
00:39:46,356 --> 00:39:51,589
いつか君を消してゆこう
Will eventually erase you

473
00:39:46,189 --> 00:39:48,856
失う前に
Before losing

474
00:39:48,856 --> 00:39:51,589
消えてしまう前に
Before disappearing

475
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:56,589
ただ結んだ長い糸 ほどけ落ちていなかった
The long thread we just tied hadn't come undone

476
00:39:56,589 --> 00:40:00,056
きっと僕たちは...
Surely we...

477
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,864
...さと時が降る
...and time descends

478
00:40:01,864 --> 00:40:05,564
きっと
Surely

479
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:46,064
Pandangan Pertama
First Sight

480
00:40:58,764 --> 00:41:03,464
Lama ku memendam rasa di dada
I've been harboring these feelings in my chest

481
00:41:03,464 --> 00:41:08,464
Mengagumi indahmu wahai jelita
Admiring your beauty, oh gorgeous

482
00:41:08,464 --> 00:41:13,464
Tak dapat lagi ku ucap kata
I can no longer say a word

483
00:41:13,464 --> 00:41:18,464
Bisuku diam terpesona
My silence, stunned in awe

484
00:41:18,464 --> 00:41:23,464
Dan andai suatu hari kau jadi milikku
And if one day you become mine

485
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:28,464
Tak akan ku lepas dirimu oh kasih
I won't let you go, oh my love

486
00:41:28,464 --> 00:41:38,264
Dan bila waktu mengizinkanku untuk menunggu dirimu
And if time allows me to wait for you

487
00:41:38,264 --> 00:41:43,264
Kurasa ku t'lah jatuh cinta
I think I've fallen in love

488
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:47,864
Pada pandangan yang pertama
At first sight

489
00:41:47,864 --> 00:41:52,564
Sulit bagiku untuk bisa
It's hard for me to be able to

490
00:41:52,564 --> 00:41:58,264
Berhenti mengagumi dirinya
Stop admiring her

491
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:08,564
Seiring dengan berjalannya waktu
As time goes by

492
00:42:08,564 --> 00:42:13,564
Akhirnya kita berdua bertemu
Finally, the two of us meet

493
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:18,564
Oh diriku tersipu malu
Oh, I'm blushing

494
00:42:18,564 --> 00:42:23,564
Melihat sikapmu yang lucu
Seeing your cute behavior

495
00:42:23,564 --> 00:42:28,564
Dan andai suatu hari kau jadi milikku
And if one day you become mine

496
00:42:28,564 --> 00:42:33,564
Tak akan ku lepas dirimu oh kasih
I won't let you go, oh my love

497
00:42:33,564 --> 00:42:43,264
Dan bila waktu mengizinkanku untuk menunggu dirimu
And if time allows me to wait for you

498
00:42:43,264 --> 00:42:48,264
Kurasa ku t'lah jatuh cinta
I think I've fallen in love

499
00:42:48,264 --> 00:42:52,564
Pada pandangan yang pertama
At first sight

500
00:42:52,564 --> 00:42:57,564
Sulit bagiku untuk bisa
It's hard for me to be able to

501
00:42:57,564 --> 00:43:02,364
Berhenti mengagumi dirinya
Stop admiring her

502
00:43:02,364 --> 00:43:07,364
Oh Tuhan tolong diriku
Oh Lord, please help me

503
00:43:07,364 --> 00:43:12,364
Tuk membuat dia menjadi milikku
To make her mine

504
00:43:12,364 --> 00:43:16,264
Sayangku, kasihku, oh cintaku
My darling, my dear, oh my love

505
00:43:16,264 --> 00:43:20,264
She's all that I need

506
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,364
Dan bila kita bersama
And when we are together

507
00:43:23,364 --> 00:43:29,064
Kan ku jaga dirimu untuk selamanya
I will protect you forever

508
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:38,064
Oh terima cintaku
Oh, accept my love

509
00:43:39,164 --> 00:43:41,064
Summertime, ain't a summertime

510
00:43:41,064 --> 00:43:42,264
if I don't have you as mine,

511
00:43:42,264 --> 00:43:43,564
but you're always on my mind, yeah.

512
00:43:43,864 --> 00:43:45,564
In the magazine you showed up

513
00:43:45,564 --> 00:43:48,064
baby girl your beauty makes my mind blow up.

514
00:43:48,064 --> 00:43:50,064
Your personality's calm and friendly

515
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:52,564
the kinda girl that I would love to be with me.

516
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:54,564
Once I start, no I won't fall back

517
00:43:54,564 --> 00:43:55,864
here's my cellphone number

518
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:57,564
so please call back, come on!

519
00:43:57,564 --> 00:44:02,564
Kurasa ku t'lah jatuh cinta
I think I've fallen in love

520
00:44:02,564 --> 00:44:07,564
Pada pandangan yang pertama
At first sight

521
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:12,564
Sulit bagiku untuk bisa
It's hard for me to be able to

522
00:44:12,564 --> 00:44:17,564
Berhenti mengagumi dirinya
Stop admiring her

523
00:44:17,564 --> 00:44:22,564
Oh Tuhan tolong diriku
Oh Lord, please help me

524
00:44:22,564 --> 00:44:27,264
Tuk membuat dia menjadi milikku
To make her mine

525
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:31,264
Sayangku, kasihku, oh cintaku
My darling, my dear, oh my love

526
00:44:31,264 --> 00:44:36,264
She's all that I need

527
00:45:44,472 --> 00:45:47,872
Pesawat Kertas 365 Hari
365-Day Paper Plane

528
00:45:49,197 --> 00:45:52,622
Kutatapan langit di pagi hari
I gaze at the sky in the morning

529
00:45:53,372 --> 00:45:56,922
Kuawali hari dengan doa
I start the day with a prayer

530
00:45:57,722 --> 00:46:01,397
Semoga satu hari ini bisa
Hoping that this one day can

531
00:46:02,222 --> 00:46:05,872
Dipenuhi oleh senyum
Be filled with smiles

532
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:10,622
Walau pun terkadang hujan turun
Even though sometimes rain falls

533
00:46:11,497 --> 00:46:14,972
Dan air mata juga mengalir
And tears also flow

534
00:46:15,897 --> 00:46:20,247
Di hari yang tak berjalan dengan mulus
On days that don't go smoothly

535
00:46:21,122 --> 00:46:24,497
Besok pun tetap semangat
I'll still stay spirited for tomorrow

536
00:46:25,597 --> 00:46:29,222
Di dalam mimpiku selalu
In my dreams, I always

537
00:46:29,947 --> 00:46:33,497
Terlihat ada diriku sendiri
See myself

538
00:46:34,322 --> 00:46:38,147
Yang dengan bebasnya melakukan semua
Freely doing everything

539
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:42,622
Hal yang ingin aku lakukan
The things I want to do

540
00:46:43,672 --> 00:46:47,372
Hidup bagaikan pesawat kertas
Life is like a paper plane

541
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:51,172
Terbang dan pergi membawa impian
Flying and going, carrying dreams

542
00:46:52,097 --> 00:46:55,722
Sekuat tenaga dengan hembusan angin
With all its might, with the gust of wind

543
00:46:56,597 --> 00:47:00,347
Terus melaju terbang
It continues to speed and fly

544
00:47:01,197 --> 00:47:05,047
Jangan bandingkan jarak terbangnya
Don't compare how far it flies

545
00:47:05,847 --> 00:47:09,597
Tapi bagaimana dan apa yang dilalui
But how and what it went through

546
00:47:10,447 --> 00:47:14,147
Karena itulah satu hal yang penting
Because that's the one important thing

547
00:47:14,997 --> 00:47:18,522
Selalu sesuai kata hati
To always follow your heart

Di saat terlihat bintang-bintang
At the time the stars are visible

550
00:47:42,497 --> 00:47:45,997
Atau malam yang gelap gulita
Or the pitch-black night

551
00:47:46,847 --> 00:47:50,397
Pada saat semangatmu hilang, carilah
When your spirit is gone, look for

552
00:47:51,347 --> 00:47:54,922
Orang lain dan bicaralah
Another person and speak

553
00:47:55,847 --> 00:47:59,422
Manusia tidaklah pernah
Humans are never

554
00:48:00,247 --> 00:48:04,022
Ditinggal sendirian saja
Left all alone

555
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:08,597
Terkadang kita tak menyadari
Sometimes we don't realize

556
00:48:09,422 --> 00:48:12,797
Hal baik di sekitar kita
The good things around us

557
00:48:13,672 --> 00:48:17,497
Hidup bagaikan pesawat kertas
Life is like a paper plane

558
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:21,247
Terbang dan membawa cinta kita semua
Flying and carrying all our love

559
00:48:22,122 --> 00:48:25,822
Sayap yang terbentang dengan percaya diri
Wings spread wide with confidence

560
00:48:26,547 --> 00:48:30,197
Dilihat semua orang
Seen by everyone

561
00:48:31,097 --> 00:48:34,947
Walau tak tahu cara melipatnya
Even if you don't know how to fold it

562
00:48:35,722 --> 00:48:39,447
Suatu saat pasti akan berhasil lalu terbang
One day it will surely succeed and then fly

563
00:48:40,422 --> 00:48:44,097
Kekuatan harapan yang menerbangkannya
The power of hope that makes it fly

564
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,497
Ya, mari mimpi lebih lah
Yes, let's dream even more

Aku akan ketemu kalian di membership, oke?

735

でわ、本当の本当の本当の最後の曲になります。 はい!
Now, it's time for the truly, truly, truly last song. Yes!

736
00:58:57,188 --> 00:58:59,588
This will be my last song for tonight.

737
00:58:59,688 --> 00:59:01,088
I hope you're ready.

738
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:04,288
This last song will be...

739
00:59:04,388 --> 00:59:06,088
心の坂道
Heart's Sloped Path

740
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:08,588
手話で。
In sign language.

741
00:59:13,588 --> 00:59:17,588
何度も苦しい思いをした
I've been through pain more times than I can say

742
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:21,588
何度も悲しい思いもした
I've felt the sorrow that wouldn't go away

743
00:59:21,688 --> 00:59:25,588
今日までたくさん歩いてきた
Step by step, I've made it here today

744
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:30,088
心の坂道を (坂道を)
Up the hill where my feelings lay (Up the hill)

745
00:59:47,088 --> 00:59:54,088
歩き慣れた帰り道
I tripped and fell on the road I always take

746
00:59:54,188 --> 00:59:56,588
のぞせむ転んだ
Caught off guard,

747
00:59:56,688 --> 00:59:58,288
不意打ちみたいで
like a sudden break

748
00:59:58,388 --> 00:59:59,588
まるで裏切られた気分
It hit me like a stab in the back

749
01:00:02,356 --> 01:00:04,506
破けちゃったジーンズと
In torn-up jeans and

750
01:00:04,506 --> 01:00:06,366
心の隙間に
a heart with a crack,

751
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:09,276
冷たい風が抜ける
The cold wind gently passes through.

752
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:11,696
小石蹴飛ばして一歩
I kick a pebble as I move on too.

753
01:00:11,696 --> 01:00:13,846
踏み出すとき君が
The moment I take a single step ahead,

754
01:00:13,846 --> 01:00:17,256
いてくれてたんだ
I found you standing there instead.

755
01:00:17,256 --> 01:00:20,936
何度も苦しい思いをした
I've been through pain more times than I can say,

756

758
01:00:28,366 --> 01:00:34,596

759

君がいたから強くなれた

君がいるから歩いて行けるさ
Because you're here with me, I know I'll keep walking free.

762
01:00:45,816 --> 01:00:49,616
涙の足跡残さないで
Leaving no trails for the world to see.

763
01:01:07,656 --> 01:01:13,526
あの日君は言ってた
That day, you said to me,

764
01:01:13,526 --> 01:01:25,406
本当の強さは泣いてもまた笑えることだよ
True strength is being able to cry, then smile again, you know?

765
01:01:26,426 --> 01:01:30,216
何度も苦しい思いをした
I've been through pain more times than I can say,
