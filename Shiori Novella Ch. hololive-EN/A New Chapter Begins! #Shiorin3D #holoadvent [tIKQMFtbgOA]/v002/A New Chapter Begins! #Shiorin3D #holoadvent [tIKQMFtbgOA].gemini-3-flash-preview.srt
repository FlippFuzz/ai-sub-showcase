00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
Dear Novelites,

3
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,100
I'm sorry to have left suddenly.

4
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,000
Trust me, I didn't want to,

5
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
but hopefully I'll be back soon.

6
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,100
If I'm not though, then you deserve to know what happened.

7
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,400
Remember when I mentioned those unsettling dreams I've been getting?

8
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,800
I'm just in this courtyard, but

9
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,200
everything feels off when I'm there.

10
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,800
Like, imagine if you lived your whole life underwater

11
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,300
and then one day you were on the surface.

12
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,500
There's something alien about that place.

13
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,500
And when Dream Me is there,

14
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,300
I'm filled with a sense of being trapped.

15
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,400
It builds and...

16
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,300
well, lately I keep ending up in that courtyard every time I dream,

17
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,200
which has made it hard for me to fall asleep.

18
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,400
I was hoping the dreams would fade

19
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,100
so I could continue with my normal routine.

20
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,300
But since then, they've only grown in intensity.

21
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,500
Finally, I just couldn't take it anymore.

22
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,600
I'd seen that distant castle in my dreams enough times

23
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,400
to be able to write a detailed description of it.

24
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,800
When I did some research,

25
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,300
I found a place just like it in the real world, so I have to go there.

26
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
It might seem crazy, but there's something in the corner

27
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,300
of my mind that's pulling me towards it.

28
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,400
And I think if I do it, the dreams will finally stop.

29
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,400
Sorry again for not telling you how bad things have gotten.

30
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,800
The truth is, it wasn't something I wanted to deal with.

31
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,400
I wanted our time together to be fun and full of smiles,

32
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,200
tangents, multiple tangents, non-stop tangents,

33
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,400
and this just kept getting in the way.

34
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
So, I'm going to take care of it

35
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,000
and then go back to my happy sugar life.

36
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,300
So, yeah. See you soon!

37
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,800
Present Day

38
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,800
Well, this is the place.

39
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,100
Come on, Shiori. Get this over with

40
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,800
and then you can go back to them.

41
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,000
Huh?

42
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:04,533
Sigh.

43
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:07,533
Here goes nothing.

44
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,833
Huh?

45
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,733
What is this place?

46
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:29,033
Ah? What?

47
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:30,833
Hey! You! Get back here!

48
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,833
It's just gone now, I guess.

49
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:38,833
At least it's a nice place.

50
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,233
I was expecting something scary.

51
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,033
It's not too bad.

52
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,333
Then again, I hate the sun.

53
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:48,333
Got some pretty flowers over there.

54
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,533
Some pretty butterflies.

55
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,633
I wonder who takes care of these though.

56
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:58,333
Someone has to be a gardener here, right?

57
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:01,333
He got a big giant castle. Nice.

58
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:05,133
Wow.

59
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,533
I wonder if that place is inhabited. Hmm.

60
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:12,633
If not, I'm gonna take that place.

61
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:16,833
Oh. I feel a lot more complete too, thinking about it.

62
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:22,533
A little bit more fluid in my motion.

63
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:26,433
Ah...

64
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:31,933
Thankfully no one's here to see this.

65
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:34,533
Huh.

66
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,733
For some reason, my heart feels funny.

67
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,233
It's acting weird.

68
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,833
Not sure why.

69
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:52,533
I think... not crap.

70
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:57,433
I think... I think I'm breaking down!

71

Lyrics • Music: Utsu-P

72
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:21,033
You are blind, have no blood
Just consume soon, soon, soon
You don't know about me, you, you, you

73
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:26,533
あたし蛾だと知りゃ皆嫌うが あの蝶と何が違う?
If you knew I were a moth, you'd all hate me
But how am I different from that butterfly?

74
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:31,533
あたし蛾だと知らず皆ガサツに 繭を開く
Not knowing I'm a moth, you all crudely
Open up the cocoon

75
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:36,733
頭ちゃらんぽらん 下手具不乱不乱
宵のまにまに 裾絡み合い
Empty-headed, staggering about
In the depths of the night, our hems intertwining

76
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:42,533
蝶々の不乱不乱 闇雲喰らう喰らう
飛んで火に入った 数の自慢ばっか
A butterfly's wild dance, devouring blindly
Just boasting about how many flew into the fire

77
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:48,333
きれいな羽だけを欲しがってる 撒き散らすscaleは見ない
You only want the beautiful wings
You don't look at the scales I scatter about

78
00:07:53,033 --> 00:08:14,033
You are blind, have no blood
Just consume soon, soon, soon
You don't know about me, you, you, you

79
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:20,533
ああどうせ 自分一粉 自分一粉まみれ
Ah, anyway, I'm just covered
in my own dust, my own powder

80
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:25,533
昆虫の身分一粉 身分一粉でブラドメ
With an insect's status, I'm brand-named
by this powder, this status

81
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,533
「あんた蛾なのに頑張っててエライエライ」
"You're doing so well for a moth, good girl, good girl"

82
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,833
「だけど蛾のくせにハッピーそうで不快不快」
"But you look so happy for a moth, how disgusting"

83
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:35,533
切り抜き動画で孵化を観 感動して動画を消し 颯爽と過ごして
Watching the hatching in a clip, being moved,
then closing it and moving on briskly

84
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:41,033
正義の瞬間だけしかいらんらん 感傷の涙に溶かしたバイバイ
Only wanting the moments of justice
Good-bye, dissolved in sentimental tears

85
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:46,033
数あるペインペイン 奴らへの隠蔽隠蔽
生々しさは綺麗にさっぱりバーリーナイト
Endless pain, concealing it from them
All the rawness wiped clean on this burly night

86
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:52,033
きれいなハンディだけを欲しがってる 実際は違っても美談
They only want the beautiful handicaps
A moving tale, even if the reality is different

87
00:08:57,033 --> 00:09:18,033
You are blind, have no blood
Just consume soon, soon, soon
You don't know about me, you, you, you

88
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:24,033
嗚呼 所詮 偏見過度の嫌い 過度の美化でパスだね
Ah, in the end, it's just hatred from prejudice
And a pass given by excessive glorification

89
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:29,533
こちらの身分差分 身分差分でブラドメ
With this status difference, I'm brand-named
by this status, this difference

90
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:56,533
Why don't you wanna be a moth?
(ちょうちょよちょうちょ 息の根とまれ)
Don't you wanna be a moth?
Why don't you wanna be a moth?
(Little butterfly, little butterfly, stop your breath)
Don't you wanna be a moth?

91
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,245
モスは火に…
Moth to the flame...

92
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:02,545
Don't you wanna be a moth?

93
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:03,545
Like a moth...

94
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:04,545
モスは火に…
Moth to the flame...

95
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:05,545
Don't you wanna be a moth?

96
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:19,545
Uh...

97
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:23,045
Where am I?

98
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:28,545
Hello?

99
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,545
Anyone here?

100
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:34,545
Hello?

101
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:37,545
Really? Just me...

102
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:40,545
...in this Halloween-looking town.

103
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:43,545
Feels a lot different though.

104
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:47,545
Feeling a little bit more... more powerful, actually.

105
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:49,045
Hehe!

106
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:54,545
Even my eyes are glowing a lot more brighter than usual.

107
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:57,045
Ooh! Look at my shoes.

108
00:10:58,045 --> 00:11:01,045
I can stomp a little bit better now, too.

109
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:06,545
And my skirt...

110
00:11:06,545 --> 00:11:11,545
I feel like it has a lot more bounce to it.

111
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:13,545
Hehe!

112
00:11:13,545 --> 00:11:15,545
Ah! I'm feeling great.

113
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:18,545
But what is this place?

114
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,545
There's eye flowers around here.

115
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:25,545
You guys look a lot like my Novelites, huh?

116
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:28,545
My little inky babies.

117
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:31,545
What else is around here?

118
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:33,545
Oh!

119
00:11:33,545 --> 00:11:36,545
There's a bookshelf over there.

120
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:41,045
I guess if I'm hungry, I can eat something here.

121
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:42,545
Let's see... what do you have?

122
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:44,545
Eeny meeny miny moe...

123
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:46,545
...maybe I'll eat you later.

124
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:53,545
Ooh! A wonderful, glorious castle over there.

125
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:56,545
It's quite pretty.

126
00:11:57,045 --> 00:12:00,045
And a round, spectacular moon.

127
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:04,545
Maybe it's the end of the world here. Who knows?

128
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:06,545
月が綺麗。
The moon is beautiful.

129
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:11,045
I'm not sure what I'm doing here, though.

130
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:13,045
I feel like there's something missing.

131
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:14,545
What's this?

132
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:18,545
Shiori Novella walked towards the table and examines the weird grooves in it.

133
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:24,545
She wonders if this could be the key to freeing her from this strange world she's found herself in.

134
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,545
Rissa, are you stalking me again?

135
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:30,045
Hiya darling! Don't mind me...

136
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:31,545
...I'm just narrating for you.

137
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:33,545
What do you mean by narrating, huh?

138
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,545
It's this new side hustle we all got.

139
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:36,545
We?

140
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:38,545
The pay is really good!

141
00:12:39,045 --> 00:12:41,045
Yeah! Can you do something please?

142
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:42,545
You know, so then we can narrate it?

143
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:45,045
Yeah, pretty please!

144
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,545
We're getting paid by the word, you know.

145
00:12:47,545 --> 00:12:48,545
Uhh...

146
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:51,545
They have some cue cards we can read too, if you want to hear them.

147
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:53,545
Yeah! Why don't I read you one now?

148
00:12:53,545 --> 00:12:56,545
This one says, 'Shiori seems concerned...'

149
00:12:56,545 --> 00:12:59,545
...that she can't silence the voices in her head.'

150
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,545
Oh, sorry Shiori. Are we being too loud?

151
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:05,545
Yeah, there's this thing called a mute button.

152
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:07,545
I would like you to use it.

153
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:13,045
You definitely might be going a little loopy, huh?

154
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:17,545
Oh, I wonder if Shiori's mind created us to protect itself.

155
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:20,545
Wait, but if we're made up...

156
00:13:20,545 --> 00:13:22,545
...will we still get paid?

157
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:24,545
Ugh, you guys only care about that?

158
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:28,545
Ah, don't worry so much about it.

159
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:32,045
Real or fake, we're your friends, and we're going to help you through this.

160
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,545
And we're not the only ones.

161
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:35,045
Oh?

162
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:36,545
What's that supposed to mean?

163
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:38,045
Is there anyone else here?

164
00:13:38,545 --> 00:13:39,545
You guys!

165
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:41,545
You came...

166
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:42,545
Hey! Get off the floor!

167
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:44,545
No, don't crap over here!

168
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:47,045
I can't believe it.

169
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:48,545
No! Jacka!

170
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:52,045
I can't believe you guys are here.

171
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:56,045
You're supposed to make this a happy occasion, but I can't believe you start crapping on my floor.

172
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,545
What are you guys doing here, though?

173
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:00,545
Salt and Pepper.

174
00:14:00,545 --> 00:14:03,545
Shiori followed the Nyakuzas towards the bookshelf.

175
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:06,545
Books had always been her source of comfort during hard times...

176
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:10,545
...so returning to them now felt natural to her.

177
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:14,545
Hey, are there any fan fictions of your oshi in there?

178
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:16,545
Of course there are!

179
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:18,545
This is Shiori's bookshelf, after all.

180
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:21,045
Oh hey! That reminds me of this great manga...

181
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:22,545
...I read the other day about...

182
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:24,545
Hey, back to topic, you guys!

183
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:27,545
By the way, who is your oshi, Shiori?

184
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:30,045
It's me, right? Me? Me?

185
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:33,045
What a funny joke. Ahaha!

186
00:14:33,545 --> 00:14:36,545
You know, ever since we started narrating for you, I've had this odd urge to tangent.

187
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:40,045
I think it's the magic of this realm.

188
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:44,545
We're all slowly becoming Shioris.

189
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:48,045
Yeah, how about let's not do that, huh?

190
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:51,545
It means we better help you out quickly.

191
00:14:51,545 --> 00:14:54,545
I don't think the internet is ready for eight 'bye people'.

192
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:57,045
Hey, I'm wholesome though!

193
00:14:57,045 --> 00:15:00,045
I'm a wholesome Hololive girl. Hehe!

194
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:03,957
I can already feel the intrusive thoughts creeping up on me!

195
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:05,457
Resist, Biboo!

196
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:09,157
Uh, say, Shiori, I think the Nyakuzas want to tell you something.

197
00:15:09,157 --> 00:15:10,557
What is it?

198
00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:12,657
You guys are pointing at something?

199
00:15:14,557 --> 00:15:17,057
Huh, the Nyakuzas are saying that the books are

200
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:18,957
full of pages trapped away in your mind.

201
00:15:18,957 --> 00:15:20,557
If you unlock what's within,

202
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:21,557
you'll be able to go back home,

203
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:22,557
so go on, take a book.

204
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:24,457
Already on it!

205
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,457
How about this little one?

206
00:15:27,857 --> 00:15:29,557
Ooh, Shiori grabbed one of the

207
00:15:29,557 --> 00:15:31,457
most powerful books out there.

208
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:36,557
It contains vast wisdoms about humanity.

209
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:39,057
But to unlock it, you have to go under

210
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:41,957
a great and difficult trial.

211
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:44,957
Was she sure that she was ready?

212
00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:48,457
Kind of trial is this, huh?

213
00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:50,057
Koseki Bijou (古石ビジュ)
Koseki Bijou

214
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:57,057
Okay, Shiori...

215
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,057
For this book, I want you to act out some memes

216
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:01,157
or maybe some poses for me.

217
00:16:04,257 --> 00:16:07,157
Come on, even, you know, just two would work.

218
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,657
That's what I think of your memes though, but...

219
00:16:09,657 --> 00:16:13,057
I changed my mind, Shiori. I want you to do three. Yeah.

220
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:14,657
Three! Three memes!

221
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:16,557
All right. Just for you,

222
00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:18,057
but you have to be specific.

223
00:16:18,057 --> 00:16:19,457
What do you want me to do?

224
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:23,057
Hmm, for the first one maybe, you could unleash

225
00:16:23,057 --> 00:16:26,557
your patented Shiori Beam!

226
00:16:26,557 --> 00:16:28,157
My Shiori Beam?

227
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:31,857
Ah, fine, just for you. Okay.

228
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:40,057
The... Shiori... Beam!

229
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:45,357
Oh! Oh, um, ah, ah! That was... that was pretty close!

230
00:16:45,357 --> 00:16:47,057
Uh, can you do it again? Maybe this time shout

231
00:16:47,057 --> 00:16:48,557
something cool like "EXPLOSION!" or something?

232
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:50,557
I think you're expecting too much from me.

233
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:52,057
How about we do something else?

234
00:16:55,357 --> 00:16:57,157
Aw, okay fine.

235
00:16:57,157 --> 00:17:00,657
Hmm... Oh, oh, I know!

236
00:17:00,657 --> 00:17:04,257
For the next one, you have a lot of people watching, right?

237
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:07,157
I want you to rizz up the audience.

238
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:09,057
Yeah, can you like captivate the camera

239
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:11,157
and then and then give us your best line?

240
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:13,457
Yeah, do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

241
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:15,557
Is this like your secret fantasy, Bibbs?

242
00:17:15,557 --> 00:17:19,057
No, no! Just do it. Just do it. I'm in charge here, okay?

243
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:21,057
Ah, that's what you want, huh?

244
00:17:23,257 --> 00:17:25,557
But tonight, I'm using you.

245
00:17:25,557 --> 00:17:27,757
Shiori! Bibbs!

246
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:30,957
What? Wow!

247
00:17:30,957 --> 00:17:33,457
Are you okay there, my girl?

248
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:34,957
Yeah, yeah, I'm all good.

249
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:36,557
You're not supposed to be rizzing the rizz-er,

250
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,257
you're supposed to be rizzing everybody else!

251
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,057
But she's always rizz'd, though.

252
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:43,057
I'm... I'm sure everybody is blushing now, right?

253
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:45,357
That was... that was pretty good.

254
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,057
Oh well, okay. I have a third one for you. Are you ready?

255
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:51,957
Sure, just for you.

256
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:54,057
Okay, for this last one, I want you to pretend

257
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:56,057
that the darkness is consuming you

258
00:17:56,057 --> 00:17:58,057
and you're in danger,

259
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:01,057
and the only thing that will save your life

260
00:18:01,057 --> 00:18:04,257
is if you hit the biggest dab ever.

261
00:18:06,357 --> 00:18:09,157
Ah, the things I do for love. Okay. How's this?

262
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:11,857
Dab!

263
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:14,357
Shiori! Wow!

264
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:16,557
That was weak. That's not fighting for your life,

265
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:18,257
that's like you're bored. Okay, do it again!

266
00:18:18,257 --> 00:18:22,557
But this time, power, energy!

267
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:24,457
Powerful dab?

268
00:18:24,457 --> 00:18:25,557
Yes!

269
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:28,957
Okay. Gotta get all my trauma here. Okay.

270
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:30,857
Hyuh... Dab!

271
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:35,857
Ooh! Okay, Shiori, that was pretty good.

272
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:37,557
Ooh! Okay, Shiori, that was pretty good.

273
00:18:37,557 --> 00:18:38,557
Now can you like dab back and forth

274
00:18:38,557 --> 00:18:40,057
like ten times over and over and over again?

275
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:42,557
Okay, I think that's expecting too much, though.

276
00:18:42,557 --> 00:18:45,157
I think that's enough memes for you, Bibbs.

277
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:56,057
Through her efforts, Shiori gained two apples

278
00:18:56,057 --> 00:18:57,057
that contain magical powers

279
00:18:57,057 --> 00:18:57,957
from all of her cringe.

280
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:04,957
Oh, I can make the apples kiss!

281
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:07,057
All right, now that I have these key items,

282
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:08,557
I'm gonna head out of here.

283
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:22,457
All right! Where do I put these apples?

284
00:19:22,457 --> 00:19:24,057
That's not how it works, Shiori.

285
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:26,057
You're trying to jump ahead,

286
00:19:26,057 --> 00:19:29,557
but you gotta do the trials in order.

287
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:31,257
Ah, all right. What do?

288
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:34,057
You need to do all the dabs, okay?

289
00:19:34,057 --> 00:19:37,457
Come on! Go! I'll help you unlock the pink book.

290
00:19:37,457 --> 00:19:38,857
Got it.

291
00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:41,257
Oh fine, even the Nyakuzas want to help.

292
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:46,057
All right, pink book, let's see.

293
00:19:46,457 --> 00:19:48,057
This one!

294
00:19:49,457 --> 00:19:51,457
What's this book?

295
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,057
Nyakuza... Hmm, they say that that's the

296
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:54,457
"Book of Playtime," which is my favorite!

297
00:19:54,457 --> 00:19:57,257
All you have to do is juggle the apples.

298
00:19:57,957 --> 00:19:59,857
If you say so!

299
00:19:57,957 --> 00:20:00,057
PLAY TIME (プレタイム)
PLAY TIME

300
00:20:07,194 --> 00:20:12,569
You know, juggling hasn't worked for me in the past.

301
00:20:13,194 --> 00:20:16,319
Uh... let me check what this script says then.

302
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,444
You have a script?

303
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:23,819
Well, good news.

304
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:28,069
Please all of them having fun so, even if you don't do it right, it's still good enough.

305
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:29,694
Huh?

306
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:33,444
Well, if you're okay with good enough, it's good enough for me!

307
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:35,069
Alright.

308
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:35,944
Do your best!

309
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:36,819
I'll try.

310
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,319
Alright, let's go! Oh!

311
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,069
Hah! Oh, it's not too bad!

312
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,819
Ah! Oh! Whoa!

313
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:46,069
Spinning and juggling!

314
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:50,069
Yeah, you like that? You're getting entertained, aren't you?

315
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:49,694
You're getting best!

316
00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:51,194
Yeah!

317
00:20:50,944 --> 00:20:53,069
Are you sure you weren't born to do this?

318
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,069
Oh, you think I was born to be a clown?

319
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,694
I'm not saying you're a clown, you're Shiori!

320
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:03,319
Oh, so I'm not funny enough for you now, huh?

321
00:21:05,194 --> 00:21:07,569
How long do you want me to do this for?

322
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:10,069
Oh, that's good enough! Oh, my luck ran out.

323
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,319
Uh... Alright, let's see what we got.

324
00:21:16,194 --> 00:21:17,069
Whoa!

325
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:18,944
Whoa!

326
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,069
Ooh!

327
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:23,069
Huh!

328
00:21:25,194 --> 00:21:27,319
Huh, it looks like you're gearing up, huh?

329
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:32,944
Because... if there's an RPG section of the trial, then maybe you can use that pot as your helmet?

330
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:35,444
It does come with a plus three to magic.

331
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:36,569
Hah! Oh!

332
00:21:36,694 --> 00:21:38,319
Where does it say that, Bijuu?

333
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,069
Yeah!

334
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:44,319
Whoa, Shiori! You're definitely equipped then, huh?

335
00:21:44,444 --> 00:21:46,569
You just want me to look stupid!

336
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:47,944
Hey!

337
00:21:47,944 --> 00:21:52,319
Not like that, you know? This way you'll be ready just in case there's a boss fight!

338
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,569
Ugh...

339
00:21:53,694 --> 00:21:54,694
Fine!

340
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:57,694
I'm only doing this because of love! Ha!

341
00:21:58,444 --> 00:21:59,694
Like this?

342
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,194
Shiori apparently puts the cauldron on her head.

343
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:07,819
It grants her the power of... I don't know, mild neck pain probably.

344
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:11,944
Shiori, is wearing that helping?

345
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:14,694
No, but I feel kind of funny.

346
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,694
Uh, maybe you should try and be Shiori beam, no just to be sure.

347
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:22,069
Come on Moco-chan, don't tease Shiori.

348
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:27,194
The script doesn't say anything about a boss fight or Shiori wearing the cauldron! Hah!

349
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:30,944
Shiori will... remember this!

350
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:50,069
Alright, what do I do now?

351
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:55,319
Oh, the Nyakuzas say that you can use the cauldron to unlock the Blue Book of Responsibilities.

352
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:01,444
All you need to do to complete that task is make us an apple pie.

353
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:05,194
I'm sorry, you want me to make an apple pie with these?

354
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:06,694
Mhm!

355
00:23:06,694 --> 00:23:07,444
Uh...

356
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:08,819
Alright.

357
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:10,569
Now what book is this?

358
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,319
Oh!

359
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:15,194
Check this out.

360
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:26,569
Hey, just wondering but, who wrote your script?

361
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:32,444
Well, I don't know. I guess it could have been anyone really. Anyway...

362
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:34,694
Where was I?

363
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:41,319
Oh, here! After the Nyakuzas' display of awesome magical abilities...

364
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:45,444
...the likes of which no other creatures could ever dream of attaining...

365
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:51,069
...Shiori took the greatest spoon ever crafted and used it to stir the apples.

366
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,069
The spoon? Why is it so big?

367
00:23:54,444 --> 00:23:57,319
Hey, I could probably bonk you guys with this.

368
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,819
No bonking, please.

369
00:23:58,944 --> 00:23:59,944
Oh, fine.

370
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:02,069
I'll just use it for spoon things.

371
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:05,569
Just like that! Alright. Think this will actually make apple pie?

372
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,569
Hah! Yah! Hah!

373
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:10,194
Looks good!

374
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,819
Alright, let's see what's inside then.

375
00:24:14,444 --> 00:24:15,569
Oh!

376
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,319
Oh!

377
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:19,569
Hey!

378
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:22,569
Shiori takes the apple pie.

379
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:27,569
Meanwhile, her friends who may or may not be imaginary but are definitely very hungry...

380
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:31,069
...look at the pie with anticipation.

381
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:36,694
Yeah, can you do us a favor and leave the pie on the table so we can imagine eating it?

382
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:41,319
Oh, my hungry puppies. I don't think you're allowed to eat apple pie though.

383
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:43,194
What? No!

384
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:44,319
Please! Please!

385
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:47,444
No! Writing is really hard work!

386
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,319
We'll see, we'll see.

387
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,319
Oh...

388
00:25:04,381 --> 00:25:05,181
Alright!

389
00:25:05,581 --> 00:25:08,581
Now that we have that apple pie,

390
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:09,981
what now?

391
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:12,881
Shiori put the pie on the table.

392
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:17,681
Then she thought it would be nice to pour tofu milk for her friends too.

393
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,881
I don't have tofu milk.

394
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:22,581
What? Are you sure?

395
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:27,281
I'm very sure that I don't have tofu milk.

396
00:25:29,881 --> 00:25:32,181
Maybe we could just pretend?

397
00:25:32,381 --> 00:25:33,281
Alright.

398
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:35,081
That's a good idea!

399
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:39,081
Ah...

400
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:42,581
It turns out imaginary milk is pretty good.

401
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:46,581
Ah, give it here! I want it for my imaginary coffee.

402
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:48,881
Oh, I'll trade you for a slice of the apple pie.

403
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,881
Deal! Shiori, can you give Mococo some pie?

404
00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:57,681
How am I going to give my imaginary friends my imaginary pie?

405
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:01,281
But you know what? I think a better question would be,

406
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:04,581
what do I do with this?

407
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:14,081
Cool! Maybe you're supposed to wield it as your sword?

408
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,081
Like this?

409
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:17,881
It does come with a plus three to attack.

410
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:21,081
Seriously, where are you seeing these numbers?

411
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,081
Moco-chan, why would a microphone be her weapon?

412
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:28,581
Huh? I don't know, but if she's an adventurer, she's gonna need a sword, okay?

413
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,581
Like with the power of music?

414
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:31,881
Yeah!

415
00:26:32,081 --> 00:26:34,081
But she's not an adventurer in the script.

416
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:37,681
Well, maybe I want to add my own parts to this script, huh?

417
00:26:37,881 --> 00:26:39,581
Is that really so wrong?

418
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:41,881
Come on, she wants to go home.

419
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:44,281
Don't worry, Shiori, I can help you with that.

420
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:47,381
Why don't you go back to the bookshelf?

421
00:26:48,081 --> 00:26:49,881
At least one person's useful here.

422
00:26:50,081 --> 00:26:53,081
Don't worry, Shiori, this is almost over, I promise.

423
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:55,581
But first, you need to unlock the Book of Memories.

424
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:59,881
Do you remember ever getting lulled to sleep by a lullaby when you were a child?

425
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:02,581
Of course not. I had no childhood.

426
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:04,281
Oh, well...

427
00:27:04,481 --> 00:27:08,581
To unlock the powers of the final book, you need to take the microphone and sing the Nyakuza to sleep.

428
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:10,281
You've got this, okay?

429
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:12,581
Alright. I'll do my best.

430
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:16,081

00:28:07,581 --> 00:28:10,081

I've grown to hate this life.

439
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:11,581

So, shall I be reborn?

440
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:13,881
「異常」が胸を埋め尽くして
"Abnormality" fills my chest completely,

441
00:28:13,881 --> 00:28:16,281

00:30:32,593 --> 00:30:34,593
普通じゃない自分になるの
I'll become a version of me that isn't normal

498
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:37,093
自問自答 繰り返し 手に入れた
Repeatedly questioning myself, I've obtained...

499
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:41,093
新しいワタシを
...my new self

500
00:30:54,293 --> 00:30:56,893
That wasn't a lullaby!

501
00:30:57,193 --> 00:30:58,493
Eh? Are you sure?

502
00:30:58,893 --> 00:31:02,293
I'd give anything to be back in the library.

503
00:31:02,593 --> 00:31:06,593
What do you mean? I fall asleep to that song all the time!

504
00:31:08,593 --> 00:31:10,593
Oh! Well, it looks like it worked anyway!

505
00:31:10,593 --> 00:31:12,393
You have the last item!

506
00:31:12,693 --> 00:31:13,693
Oh?

507
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:16,493
Oh nice! The beautiful purple heart!

508
00:31:16,693 --> 00:31:18,593
But what do I do with this now?

509
00:31:19,493 --> 00:31:23,593
I think the Novelites are telling you to put the items in their slots on the table.

510
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:27,593
Ah, なるほど。All right, let's put this over here...
Ah, I see. All right, let's put this over here...

511
00:31:31,293 --> 00:31:33,893
And then we got the microphone here.

512
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:37,893
And then last but not least, we got...

513
00:31:38,293 --> 00:31:42,093
And here's my cauldron!

514
00:31:43,893 --> 00:31:46,493
Uh, was something supposed to happen now?

515
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:48,593
I think so! Mokoko?

516
00:31:48,693 --> 00:31:51,893
Ha! Ha! You did it Shiori!

517
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:56,493
Now all the books in your archive have been activated!

518
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:57,693
And you can go home!

519
00:31:57,743 --> 00:31:58,493
Yes!

520
00:31:58,543 --> 00:31:59,593
Oh! Oh!

521
00:31:59,893 --> 00:32:04,293
Those books have unlocked the power of our friendship!

522
00:32:04,593 --> 00:32:08,493
With all of us working together, we'll be able to reopen the portal!

523
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,293
We work together? I think I did everything.

524
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:12,593
And then, Shiori approached the archway...

525
00:32:12,693 --> 00:32:19,493
...eagerly awaiting the moment when the combined strength of all of her friends would cause the portal to reactivate.

526
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:22,893
Oh! So I can, I can go home now, right?

527
00:32:23,293 --> 00:32:28,593
Uh... that's weird. The power of friendship usually works.

528
00:32:29,293 --> 00:32:30,093
Eh?

529
00:32:30,293 --> 00:32:33,493
I know, right? Maybe after all this soul searching...

530
00:32:33,593 --> 00:32:34,893
...maybe we're really not friends, huh?

531
00:32:35,293 --> 00:32:38,893
Maybe she needs to find an item to give her a plus three to the power of friendship?

532
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:42,593
But what item? I think I used everything!

533
00:32:43,293 --> 00:32:45,593
Why not check the cue cards instead? Oh, let me look them over.

534
00:32:47,493 --> 00:32:49,893
I hope it helps. I don't want to be stuck here.

535
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,893
Mokoko! It says here that...

536
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:59,093
...no matter how hard Shiori wanted to, she can't move backward.

537
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:00,693
Eh?

538
00:33:00,893 --> 00:33:03,593
Sorry, that wasn't very helpful after all.

539
00:33:04,593 --> 00:33:09,593
So what you're telling me is, I'm gonna be stuck in this Halloween-ish world, right?

540
00:33:09,693 --> 00:33:10,593
Yeah.

541
00:33:10,893 --> 00:33:15,593
Don't worry Shiori, we're still here for you. Maybe there's a silver lining in all of this.

542
00:33:16,493 --> 00:33:20,093
Okay, but I'm talking to a rock, two dogs and one bird.

543
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:21,893
Well, when you put it like that...

544
00:33:22,093 --> 00:33:23,893
...maybe this isn't so great.

545
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:27,593
But this is just the start of this world!

546
00:33:27,893 --> 00:33:33,593
I bet if you keep moving forward, you'll discover that it's not as scary a place as it looks now!

547
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:36,093
Yeah, that's true!

548
00:33:36,293 --> 00:33:42,093
Plus you've gained a whole new dimension, and yeah it's different, but it might be good, right?

549
00:33:43,093 --> 00:33:46,593
Eh, I don't know. I mean, I look great.

550
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:48,893
But I still like the old me.

551
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:54,093
You're still the old you too, you know? You just got extra stuff now...

552
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:56,593
...and you're on the next part of your story.

553
00:33:56,693 --> 00:33:58,293
Yeah, I guess you do have a point.

554
00:34:00,693 --> 00:34:04,093
But you know, I wanted my character arc to be done.

555
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:08,093
Sometimes I like having things stay the way they are.

556
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:10,593
Is that really all you want?

557
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:12,493
Well, duh.

558
00:34:12,693 --> 00:34:19,293
But if all the pages in your book just repeated over and over, you know, it'd get pretty boring, right?

559
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:22,593
And even if it didn't, moving forward is how we grow.

560
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:26,093
Yeah, and how we find new games to play, or memes to make!

561
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:32,493
And how we gain new friends! We would have never met in the first place had we not taken a chance on change.

562
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:35,893
A new story would be boring without us, right?

563
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:44,293
I guess. I mean, it's great having you guys as friends, and have the Novelites to keep me company.

564
00:34:44,493 --> 00:34:52,493
But you know, sometimes I just want to look back too. And if this is my book, then I should be able to decide what happens, right?

565
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:55,093
I want to go at my own pace.

566
00:34:56,093 --> 00:34:58,593
Hey Shiori, what's that on the bookshelf?

567
00:34:58,693 --> 00:35:00,093
Huh? More books?

568
00:35:01,425 --> 00:35:02,155
What's this?

569
00:35:03,215 --> 00:35:03,985
Oh!

570
00:35:07,285 --> 00:35:08,555
Oh, wow!

571
00:35:08,955 --> 00:35:10,605
Oh...

572
00:35:10,955 --> 00:35:13,585
Hang on, there's a cue card I'm supposed to read.

573
00:35:13,925 --> 00:35:15,605
Well, hopefully this one's a good one.

574
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:17,405
Okay, well... it says,

575
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:20,605
“Don't worry Shiori, while your power will continue to grow...”

576
00:35:20,705 --> 00:35:24,605
“...and your journey will take you to realities as of yet unbeknownst to humanity...”

577
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:28,605
“...as long as you have my bookmark, you will be protected.”

578
00:35:28,905 --> 00:35:33,155
“Please use it as your link to the past and your guide to the future.”

579
00:35:33,405 --> 00:35:34,305
Mmm.

580
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:37,055
Hey, I didn't see that card earlier.

581
00:35:37,155 --> 00:35:40,105
And whose bookmark is that? Where was it?

582
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:41,605
I don't know!

583
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:45,605
I just looked away and then when I looked back, suddenly it was there in front of me.

584
00:35:45,955 --> 00:35:47,555
But what do I do with this?

585
00:35:47,985 --> 00:35:51,655
I think the Nyakuzas want you to put the bookmark in the archway.

586
00:35:51,955 --> 00:35:53,155
Ah!

587
00:35:53,355 --> 00:35:55,605
Maybe like... like this?

588
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:58,955
Oh! It worked!

589
00:36:00,405 --> 00:36:03,555
The Nyakuzas say that thanks to the bookmark, the portal's been opened permanently.

590
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:07,605
You can go back home, but the 3D world will stay available to you.

591
00:36:11,905 --> 00:36:13,605
They want you to know that this reality is so much bigger than just this one place.

592
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:17,655
There's a lot to see and archive here.

593
00:36:17,905 --> 00:36:23,105
And when you're done with this reality, there are even more places for you to explore.

594
00:36:23,655 --> 00:36:27,105
It looks like your character arc is just beginning.

595
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:30,105
But don't worry, whenever you need us, we'll be here to help, Shiori.

596
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,505
Alright!

597
00:36:31,705 --> 00:36:33,505
Whoa!

598
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:35,105
See ya suckers!

599
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:35,305

646
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:16,017
Dancing in the rain is pretty fun.

647
00:41:16,217 --> 00:41:18,517
But you know, my boots feel all gross now.

648
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:22,117
I think they're covered in water and stuff. Ew.

649
00:41:22,617 --> 00:41:25,817
Need to shake the droplets off.

650
00:41:27,817 --> 00:41:30,117
And you know what?

651
00:41:30,317 --> 00:41:32,517
My jacket makes me feel gross too.

652
00:41:32,617 --> 00:41:35,417
I think it's time we take it off!

The other arm!

659
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:48,617
Oh no, what am I doing?

660
00:41:50,117 --> 00:41:52,517
Oh, it feels a little bit better now.

661
00:41:52,717 --> 00:41:54,417
It's a lot less wet.

662
00:41:54,617 --> 00:41:55,417
So, whoo!

663
00:41:56,317 --> 00:41:58,817
Oh, this place is a lot prettier now.

664
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:01,417
I can see the stars everywhere.

665
00:42:01,617 --> 00:42:05,217
It's a lot better than being in the other world with the voices in my head.

666
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:07,517
When you hear nothing but "op"

667
00:42:07,617 --> 00:42:08,617
and "pow"

668
00:42:08,717 --> 00:42:11,317
and "let's rock," it gets a little tiring, to be honest.

669
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:14,417
Hah, it's peaceful.

670
00:42:17,417 --> 00:42:19,517
Even see some beautiful flowers.

671
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:22,517
They look like they're glowing. Oh!

672
00:42:23,217 --> 00:42:27,117
We should give a congratulations to whoever the gardener is.

673
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:30,917
Hmm, I wonder what kind of flowers these are.

674
00:42:31,617 --> 00:42:33,917
They're blue and pink.

675
00:42:35,217 --> 00:42:37,417
Meh, could be any flower.

676
00:42:37,617 --> 00:42:39,417
Ta-da-da-da.

677
00:42:39,617 --> 00:42:41,517
I wonder if I can take some.

678
00:42:41,617 --> 00:42:43,117
Hehehe.

679
00:42:44,517 --> 00:42:47,417
Oh, and it looks like the castle is...

680
00:42:47,617 --> 00:42:50,217
Oh, it has a lot of lights there.

681
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:52,017
Maybe they're having a party?

682
00:42:52,217 --> 00:42:54,117
I wonder who lives there.

683
00:42:54,317 --> 00:42:56,417
But if it's empty, it's mine now.

684
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:57,717
Oh!

685
00:42:57,817 --> 00:43:00,717
You think I could just barge in there?

686
00:43:00,917 --> 00:43:02,617
And be like "Hey you!"

687
00:43:02,717 --> 00:43:04,217
"It's Shiori!"

688
00:43:04,317 --> 00:43:06,617
"Just wandered in here, sorry!"

689
00:43:08,617 --> 00:43:10,617
Ah, but you know what?

690
00:43:10,817 --> 00:43:14,217
If breaking dimensions isn't enough for you...

691
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:17,617
well, I think it's time to break your bank!

692
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:20,617
Let's see what we can break your bank with.

693
00:43:20,817 --> 00:43:23,117
With... Oh, what is this?

694
00:43:20,817 --> 00:43:32,517
Shiori Novella Matching Belt
- A matching design with her outfit!
- Size: Belt / Approx. L115cm

695
00:43:23,317 --> 00:43:24,517
Wow!

696
00:43:24,617 --> 00:43:27,517
That looks like a handy-dandy belt!

697
00:43:27,717 --> 00:43:31,217
Oh, it looks kind of similar to my belt here, right?

698
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:32,517
Oh, it's over here.

699
00:43:32,617 --> 00:43:33,517
Yeah!

700
00:43:34,117 --> 00:43:36,617
So, if you struggle with falling pants,

701
00:43:36,817 --> 00:43:39,017
or you just don't believe in pants...

702
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:42,617
You believe they don't cover up that shame well enough...

703
00:43:42,817 --> 00:43:45,417
Well, you can get this belt to help with that.

704
00:43:45,617 --> 00:43:47,417
Yeah, it'll put your faith back in humanity

705
00:43:47,517 --> 00:43:48,917
by 0.1%.

706
00:43:49,117 --> 00:43:51,417
Oh! And if...

707
00:43:51,617 --> 00:43:53,417
if that's not enough for you,

708
00:43:53,617 --> 00:43:54,717
well, if you don't want to wear it...

709
00:43:54,817 --> 00:43:56,617
why don't you whip it?

710
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,317
I don't know, I don't care!

711
00:43:58,417 --> 00:43:59,717
But it's a belt!

712
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:02,417
Oh, and now it's time for some passion Japanese.

713

00:44:29,217 --> 00:44:30,517
Whip! Whip! Whip! Whip!

00:44:30,617 --> 00:44:32,017
あ、パンツ、パンツありますか？
Ah, underwear, do you have underwear?

727
00:44:32,117 --> 00:44:33,517
Oh, belt, belt!

728
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:35,417
そして、バンザイ！
And then, Banzai!

729
00:44:35,617 --> 00:44:36,617
カンパイ！
Cheers!

730
00:44:36,817 --> 00:44:37,817
ボンカイ？
Bonkai?

731
00:44:38,017 --> 00:44:39,217
ベルタイ！
Belt-ai!

732
00:44:39,417 --> 00:44:40,417
Ai!

733
00:44:42,617 --> 00:44:45,417
あ、私の日本語上手？
Oh, was my Nihongo jouzu?

734
00:44:45,617 --> 00:44:46,617
Hehehe.

735
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:49,317
It better be!

736
00:44:49,517 --> 00:44:51,617
Oh, but besides that... um,

737
00:44:52,517 --> 00:44:55,417
皆さん、ありがとうございます！
Everyone, thank you very much!

738
00:44:55,617 --> 00:44:56,617
Novelites,

739
00:44:56,817 --> 00:44:58,817
thank you for watching

740
00:44:59,017 --> 00:45:00,117
and helping me not perish.

741
00:45:00,729 --> 00:45:01,429
And kaput.

742
00:45:01,429 --> 00:45:05,629
Thanks to you, I now know to throw away
moldy bread and moldy food.

743
00:45:05,729 --> 00:45:06,529
Yeah!

744
00:45:06,629 --> 00:45:08,529
I now know that there's soft cheese...

745
00:45:08,629 --> 00:45:09,629
...and hard cheese...

746
00:45:09,729 --> 00:45:11,229
...and other types of cheese...

747
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:13,329
...and I just really like to point...

748
00:45:13,429 --> 00:45:15,629
...'cause I'm cheesy.

749
00:45:16,929 --> 00:45:18,529
But yeah, thank you for watching me...

750
00:45:18,629 --> 00:45:21,629
...and supporting me and keeping me company.

751
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:24,629
Sorry, I've been yelling a lot.

752
00:45:25,529 --> 00:45:27,629
It feels surreal to be here.

753
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:31,129
そして...皆さん、全部、ありがとうございます。
And... everyone, thank you for everything.

754
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:33,929
皆さんはとてもかっこいいです。
You are all very cool.

755
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:36,129
一番です！
You're the best!

756
00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:37,929
But, you know...

757
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:40,629
I have one more song for you guys.

758
00:45:41,129 --> 00:45:43,629
That's right, the number one.

759
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:48,629
So, if you don't mind taking a few more minutes...

760
00:45:49,129 --> 00:45:50,929
...to listen to my voice...

761
00:45:51,229 --> 00:45:53,129
...私の声です。
...it is my voice.

762
00:45:53,729 --> 00:45:55,329
Please, please listen.

763
00:45:55,729 --> 00:45:57,629
Or not, I don't know. Okay.

764
00:45:59,329 --> 00:46:03,629
Give me a few seconds, I'm tired.

765
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:06,129
Okay, here I go.

766
