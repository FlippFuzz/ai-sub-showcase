I want to know her secret, she's so mysterious

5
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,910
抜けてるところさえ彼女のエリア
Even her clumsy moments are within her charm's reach

00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:00,380
完璧で嘘つきな君は天才的なアイドル様
You, perfect and full of lies, are a genius idol

7
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,900
今日何食べた？好きな本は？
What did you eat today? What's your favorite book?

8
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,350
遊びに行くならどこに行くの？
If you go out for fun, where do you go?

9
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,840
何も食べてない、それは内緒
I haven't eaten anything, that's a secret

何を聞かれてものらりくらり
Dodging any questions asked

11
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,850
そう淡々とだけど燦々と
So nonchalantly, yet so brilliantly

12
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,320
見えそうで見えない秘密は蜜の味
Secrets almost visible but not, taste like honey

13
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,950
あれもないないない
That's not there, not there

14
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,300
これもないないない
This isn't there, not there

15
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,520
好きなタイプは？相手は？さあ答えて
What's your type? Who's the person? Come on, answer

16
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,400
「誰かを好きになることなんて私分からなくてさ」
"I don't really know what it's like to fall in love with someone"

17
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,380
嘘か本当か知り得ない
Impossible to know if it's a lie or the truth

18
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,600
そんな言葉にまた一人落ちる
One more person falls for those words

19
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,560

お星様の引き立て役Bです
Just character B making the star look good

29
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,800
全てがあの子のおかげなわけない
There's no way everything is thanks to her

30
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,250
洒落臭い妬み嫉みなんてないわけがない
There's no way there's no petty envy and jealousy

31
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,950
これはネタじゃないからこそ許せない
Since it's not a joke, it's unforgivable

32
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,000
完璧じゃない君じゃ許せない
I won't forgive you if you're not perfect

33
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,050
自分を許せない
I can't forgive myself

34
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,510

You have to be one and only, or else

41
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,510

That is what true love is

Working the media with a signature smile

00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,800
隠しきるこの秘密だけは
Keeping this one secret hidden

44
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,850
愛してるって嘘で積むキャリア
Building a career on the lie of "I love you"

This is my own kind of love

流れる汗もきれいなアクア
Even the flowing sweat is beautiful aqua

These eyelids that hide rubies

51
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,333
歌い踊り舞う私はマリア
Singing and dancing, I am Mary

52
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,333
そう、嘘はとびきりの愛だ
Yes, lies are an extraordinary kind of love

53
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,833
誰かに愛されたことも
Having been loved by someone

54
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:23,833
誰かのこと愛したこともない
Or having loved someone—I've never done either

55
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:29,833
そんな私の嘘がいつか本当になること信じてる
I believe that such lies of mine will one day come true

56
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,833
いつかきっと全部手に入れる
One day, I'll surely have it all

57
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,833
私はそう欲張りなアイドル
That's because I'm a greedy idol

58
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:41,333
等身大でみんなのことちゃんと愛したいから
Because I want to love everyone properly as my true self

59
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:47,833
今日も嘘をつくの この言葉がいつか本当になる日を願って
I lie today as well, wishing for the day these words will come true

60
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:54,333
それでもまだ君と君にだけは言えずにいたけど
Even so, I still haven't been able to say it only to you

61
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:59,333
あ、やっと言えた これは絶対嘘じゃない
Ah, I finally said it. This is definitely not a lie

62
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,833
愛してる
I love you

63
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:29,833
Hey! Kronichiwa!

64
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:32,733
Oh! Whew!

65
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:35,333
We did it. I hope that was good.

66
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:38,533
And, well, I hope I looked like

67
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,133
an idol on stage.

68
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,633
And if you liked the performance so far,

69
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:47,133
be sure to use the hashtag #3Dronii.

70
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:51,133
And, well, speaking of the stage, take a look at this!

71
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:55,133
Ah, it's so beautiful.

72
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:58,833
And it's like the stage was, like, made for me,

73
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,933
and only me.

74
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:03,733
Look at just how grand it is.

75
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:06,333
And, well, whew!

76
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:11,533
Yeah, it's looking a little too bright right now,

77
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,933
so shall we turn it down a bit?

78
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,133
Whew! Okay, that is much better.

79
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,733
Ooh! Oh yeah,

80
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:30,333
I guess I forgot to tell you...

81
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,333
...this, um, can change from daytime to nighttime.

82
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:39,833
I can control the time of day according to my will.

83
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:43,333
Oh wait! Hey!

84
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:47,333
Wait, wait, wait. Look at you. Wait, you got invited? What?

85
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,833
How many supers did you have to pay to get that VIP seat?

86
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:53,933
Wait, and you? Wait!

87
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,533
Get out of here! I didn't invite you.

88
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:02,333
Ah, whatever. But, oh yeah,

89
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,133
how'd you think about the song?

90
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,733
Um, I know it's pretty overdone,

91
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:10,833
but I thought it was pretty fitting

92
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,333
for this show today, don't you think?

93
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:17,833
But, yeah. It's a pretty good start for today.

94
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,333
But it doesn't stop there.

95
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:25,333
Because stay tuned, the first ever

96
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:29,333
Cronie Awards is happening right now.

97
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,733
Today, tonight, with all of you and all of me.

98
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:36,833
What does that mean?

99
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,933
Well, you've gotta stick around for that.

100
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:43,933
All right, let's get this show on the road.

101
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:46,333
Take a look at this!

102
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,833
Ladies and gentlemen...

103
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:39,133
...welcome to the Cronie Awards!

104
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:43,133
Today, we'll be joined by not one, not two...

105
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:47,333
...not even three, but four different Kroniis.

106
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,133
That's right! And each Kronii will display

107
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,933
their amazing talents...

108
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:58,833
...and the best one will receive the award

109
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,333
in this ceremony.

110
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:01,266
Crony.

111
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:02,535
Yeah.

112
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,175
Uh, let me show you what this...

113
00:10:05,175 --> 00:10:08,065
...sick award is going to look like. Give me a second.

114
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:15,760
All right, here it is.

115
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:17,955
That's right, it's the...

116
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:20,065
...Golden Crony trophy.

117
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:23,825
I know, it's looking pretty amazing.

118
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:26,185
I want it in my room.

119
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:28,345
I want it plastered everywhere.

120
00:10:28,405 --> 00:10:32,595
Man, whoever gets this will be a lucky Crony.

121
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:35,165
Gold, man.

122
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:38,095
But, you know, that's whatever.

123
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,965
None of my concern because I'm not participating,
unfortunately.

124
00:10:44,265 --> 00:10:47,985
With that, let me introduce today's participants!

125
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:49,855
First off, we have...

126
00:10:49,855 --> 00:10:53,125
...you guessed it, Miss Ouro Kronii!

127
00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:56,575
Let's all give a warm welcome to...

128
00:10:56,575 --> 00:11:00,725
...Kronii with the actress role!

129
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:04,085
Woohoo! Onwards!

130
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:19,065
Bow down to your Queen.

131
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:22,165
It's Your Majesty.

132
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:24,645
BEST ACT Kronii

133
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:26,645
Qronii

134
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:23,795
And well...

135
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:28,665
...I believe I should win because...

136
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:31,465
...I mean, just look at me.

137
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,265
If I don't, I believe it's heresy.

138
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:39,465
And everyone who didn't vote for me...

139
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:45,495
...should be sentenced for life,
because that's what they deserve.

140
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:48,985
And well, anyway...

141
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:51,965
I don't know if you can already tell, but...

142
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:56,765
...I'll be reenacting the Snow White today.

143
00:11:56,765 --> 00:12:00,495
And, you know, you can obviously tell...

144
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:03,265
...with the crown and the apple.

145
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,785
But I'll be the Queen.

146
00:12:06,165 --> 00:12:09,285
That's going to be exciting.

147
00:12:09,285 --> 00:12:13,395
I know I fit the role so well, so we'll see.

148
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:17,495
And with that, shall we begin?

149
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:20,105
Feast your eyes!

150
00:12:27,185 --> 00:12:28,465
Hmm, okay.

151
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:29,785
Let's see.

152
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:35,065
I don't know if this mirror is actually going to work.

153
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:37,205
So...

154
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:42,625
I think I might give it a little bit of a test run.

155
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:46,665
Yes, what an amazing idea, Kronii.

156
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:48,665
Thank you.

157
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:50,665
Okay, well...

158
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:55,965
Mirror, mirror on the wall...

159
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:59,395
...who is the cutest of them all?

160
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:04,865
Boros!

161
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:08,995
I mean...

162
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:11,765
...Boros is pretty cute, I guess.

163
00:13:12,065 --> 00:13:14,985
Yeah, it's a cute little snake boy.

164
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:17,065
Okay.

165
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:19,985
Yeah, it works, it works.

166
00:13:19,985 --> 00:13:21,695
Okay, you can go now.

167
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:22,565
Okay, thank you.

168
00:13:22,665 --> 00:13:23,895
Oh, okay.

169
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:27,725
Yeah, now for the real deal then.

170
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:29,165
Okay.

171
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:33,065
Mirror, mirror on the wall...

172
00:13:33,065 --> 00:13:36,495
...who is the fairest of them all?

173
00:13:41,495 --> 00:13:41,995
Huh?

174
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:45,985
What?

175
00:13:45,985 --> 00:13:47,495
Are you serious?

176
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:48,685
It's just broken.

177
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:49,665
No.

178
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:53,695
No, don't give me that happy face.

179
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:55,095
But...

180
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:56,365
...get out of here!

181
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,885
Go, shoo! What?

182
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:01,965
Disgusting!

183
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:02,995
My God!

184
00:14:04,065 --> 00:14:05,065
Okay, ugh.

185
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:06,095
Whatever.

186
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,185
I gotta get that image out of the way.

187
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:10,295
Um...

188
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:14,795
Maybe they don't understand what 'fairest' means.

189
00:14:14,925 --> 00:14:15,965
Okay.

190
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:19,595
Mirror, mirror on the wall...

191
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:23,895
...who is the most beautiful of them all?

192
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:30,645
Motoaki Tanigo

193
00:14:49,295 --> 00:14:50,495
Okay.

194
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:51,965
That was...

195
00:14:51,965 --> 00:14:53,165
...weird.

196
00:14:54,465 --> 00:14:55,295
Um...

197
00:14:58,965 --> 00:14:59,895
Okay.

198
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:02,308
I don't...

199
00:15:03,058 --> 00:15:03,358
Hmm...

200
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:04,858
Okay.

201
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,458
Mirror, mirror on the wall...

202
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:12,358
...and you best be right this time...

203
00:15:12,808 --> 00:15:16,458
...or else I'm going to hand you over to a second-hand shop.

204
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:18,758
It's your last chance.

205
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:23,958
Who is the fairest of them all?

206
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:37,958
Ay!

207
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:37,958
Ay!

208
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,858
Oh my god, what took you so long?

209
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:44,658
Oh, you know, I was just doing my hair.

210
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:46,958
Oh, please.

211
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:49,258
You look better with or without.

212
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,758
You're always so on point, girl.

213
00:15:51,058 --> 00:15:53,958
Oh you, you're always so humble.

214
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:56,158
Oh, stop it.

215
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,358
So like, what's up?

216
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,458
Uh, excuse me?

217
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:02,758
Didn't you hear?

218
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:05,858
I was like calling you multiple times.

219
00:16:06,558 --> 00:16:08,358
Oh well, I didn't call you...

220
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:12,158
...but you know, when people say who's the prettiest girl in town...

221
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,258
...I mean, you know.

222
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:19,458
I mean, prettiest girl in town, look around.

223
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:21,958
It has to be you.

224
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:25,658
Well, yeah, but...

225
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:31,958
Ay!

226
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:31,958
Ay!

227
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:39,158
Hmm, I guess... I guess you don't look half bad yourself.

228
00:16:39,858 --> 00:16:43,458
I think you could probably take second place even.

229
00:16:44,158 --> 00:16:47,358
Or even first place.

230
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:51,958
Ay!

231
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:51,958
Ay!

232
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:55,558
So...

233
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:57,758
...what are you doing after this?

234
00:16:58,358 --> 00:17:00,258
Uh, you know...

235
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:05,158
...just hanging out, relaxing, alone.

236
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,258
Completely free.

237
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,458
Nothing going on.

238
00:17:09,658 --> 00:17:11,458
Um...

239
00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:14,558
...up for some 1v1 or some local multiplayer?

240
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:20,358
Oh! Was that an invitation?

241
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,458
Hmm...

242
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:26,358
...take it as you will.

243
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:27,458
Yeah.

244
00:17:27,658 --> 00:17:29,858
You know what? I think I will.

245
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,158
Oh...

246
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:34,358
Oh...

247
00:17:42,758 --> 00:17:45,858
Ay!

248
00:17:42,758 --> 00:17:45,858
Ay!

249
00:17:46,258 --> 00:17:48,658
We're going to save that for later.

250
00:17:48,758 --> 00:17:49,958
Yeah...

251
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:50,958
...keep it on the lowdown.

252
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:52,058
You get out of here.

253
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:53,858
No, YOU get out of here.

254
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:55,358
No, YOU get out of here.

255
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,658
No, YOU get out of here.

256
00:17:57,158 --> 00:17:58,058
No, stop it.

257
00:17:58,258 --> 00:18:01,558
I'm going to chuck this apple at you if you don't go.

258
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:02,958
Yeah? You know what?

259
00:18:03,158 --> 00:18:05,158
I'm going to get out of your hair.

260
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:07,058
I'm just going to... just...

261
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:08,358
Uh, you know?

262
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,158
No, no, no. I'm going to get out first.

263
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:11,458
No, no, it's fine.

264
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,358
I'll go first. It's fine, it's fine.

265
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:15,258
No, no, no. Stop it.

266
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,958
I'll be the bigger person here.

267
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:19,558
What?

268
00:18:19,758 --> 00:18:21,558
I'm the bigger person here.

269
00:18:22,358 --> 00:18:23,958
Yeah, well, watch me leave.

270
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:25,958
Oh my god, no, stop!

271
00:18:26,258 --> 00:18:27,458
My gosh.

272
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:29,358
Can't believe she did that.

273
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:30,958
Oh my gosh.

274
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:31,958
Silly girl.

275
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:33,358
Goodness.

276
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:40,458
Oh, yeah, yeah. We were on screen, right?

277
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,358
Well, thank you so much.

278
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:50,758
I hope you liked our little performance.

279
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:53,958
It was pretty great.

280
00:18:54,258 --> 00:19:01,658
I mean, my performance, but our, our could also work.

281
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:03,458
And well...

282
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:08,758
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.

283
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:10,058
Yeah.

284
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:13,358
Why did I say that?

285
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:15,458
I don't really know.

286
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:21,058
But that is the moral of this story.

287
00:19:21,658 --> 00:19:22,358
Yes.

288
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:26,458
Apples, apples are very good for you.

289
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:28,658
Okay.

290
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:31,258
Well anyway, I got things to take care of...

291
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,258
...so toodeloo. Bye-bye.

292
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:40,658
Thank you so much for that wonderful act, Miss Kronii.

293
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,858
Your performance was truly moving.

294
00:19:46,658 --> 00:19:49,258
And I could sense the chemistry...

295
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,058
...between Mirror Kronii and Kronii.

296
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:57,058
And truly I would love to see...

297
00:19:57,258 --> 00:19:59,858
...that show again if I could.

298
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:02,958
And you know what?

299
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:06,858
I think I like it so much that I'll watch the VOD again later.

300
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:02,649
I mean what?

301
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:05,552
Anyway, next up,

302
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:08,403
let's call the next Kronii up to the stage.

303
00:20:08,723 --> 00:20:11,867
Let's all give her a warm round of applause.

304
00:20:12,142 --> 00:20:14,338
Let's go! She needs it.

305
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,810
She doesn't really. She's got the confidence,

306
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,841
but let's just give her an applause. Woo!

307
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:33,671
Um, hi.

308
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:37,671
Singronii

309
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:38,671
Um, yeah.

310
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,471
Um, it would be nice if I can win because I,

311
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:44,371
you know, worked hard.

312
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:48,671
Yeah.

313
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:52,071
Oh, um, by the way, I'm Singronii.

314
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:55,871
I'm the one that sings, if you can't tell

315
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:59,171
from the idol outfit and everything.

316
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:02,071
I'm kind of camera-shy.

317
00:21:02,371 --> 00:21:04,571
I don't really know what to do

318
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:07,371
in this kind of situation.

319
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:10,371
But yeah, I'm gonna try my best,

320
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:13,871
so it'd be nice if you guys like it too.

321
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:20,671
Um, but if you don't, it's okay.

322
00:21:20,671 --> 00:21:23,071
That's okay too.

323
00:21:24,271 --> 00:21:27,771
Ah, okay. Please listen to this song,

324
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:30,171
Charles.

325
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:41,671
さよならはあなたから言われた
Goodbye was said by you

326
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:44,971
それなのに頬を濡らしてしまうの
Yet, I find my cheeks becoming wet

327
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,571
そうやって昨日のことも消してしまうなら
If you're going to erase yesterday's events like that,

328
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:50,071
もういいよ
then forget it

329
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:51,771
笑って

331
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:08,371
花束を抱えて歩いた
Carrying a bouquet of flowers, I walked

332
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:11,671
意味もなくただ街を見下ろした
Aimlessly, just looking down at the town

333
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:17,371
こうやって理想の縁に心を掠めるもいいか
Is it okay to tickle my heart on the edge of my ideals like this?

334
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,171
空欄でいよう
Let it be empty

335
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:21,871
それでいいの?
Is that okay?

336
00:22:22,371 --> 00:22:26,371
伝い青で満たしたのならどうだろう
If I filled it with the blue that overflowed, I wonder how it'd be

337
00:22:26,371 --> 00:22:30,071
こんな風に悩めるのかな
Could I worry like this?

338
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:34,171
愛を謳って謳って雲の上

Um, I hope you guys liked that.

367
00:25:39,784 --> 00:25:43,084
Uh, that was... that was pretty tiring, but...

368
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:47,984
Yeah, uh, I'd like to think that I did my best,

369
00:25:47,984 --> 00:25:51,384
so hopefully I can, uh...

370
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:55,584
maybe be considered to- to win? I don't know.

371
00:25:57,984 --> 00:26:02,384
Oh, um, do you guys want to see some- some poses, I- I guess?

372
00:26:02,384 --> 00:26:05,084
Okay.

373
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:09,084
Odd request, but I'll- I'll try. Okay.

374
00:26:13,084 --> 00:26:15,884
Glowing, so... um, let's see.

375
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:21,084
Uh, what kind of pose do you want?

376
00:26:21,084 --> 00:26:24,584
Um, like- like this? Like maybe maybe a little bit like that?

377
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,684
I don't really know.

378
00:26:29,084 --> 00:26:31,684
Like, maybe like this?

379
00:26:31,684 --> 00:26:34,984
I'm not really sure what you guys want.

380
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:44,084
Like that? Happy?

381
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:48,884
Maybe? Is this- is this good?

382
00:26:52,384 --> 00:26:54,684
Uh, one- one last one?

383
00:26:55,784 --> 00:26:59,884
Um, I already- I already- I already did one.

384
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,084
Yeah, that's- that's it. That's- that's all from me.

385
00:27:10,084 --> 00:27:14,184
I'm gonna- I'm gonna go now. Okay.

386
00:27:14,784 --> 00:27:18,384
Get this camera out of my face. Okay, bye.

387
00:27:20,584 --> 00:27:25,584
Thank you very much, Miss Kronii, for that amazing song.

388
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:29,084
Your singing definitely has captured our hearts.

389
00:27:29,084 --> 00:27:35,084
My heart, in fact, which is the most important one.

390
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:39,784
And next up, we are going to call the next Kronii up on stage.

391
00:27:40,384 --> 00:27:44,584
And let's all give her a warm round of applause.

392
00:27:45,284 --> 00:27:48,984
Oh, but before we get on with the show,

393
00:27:48,984 --> 00:27:52,284
we're going to have a bit of a commercial break.

394
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:57,784
That's right, we are sponsored by... guess who it is?

395
00:27:58,984 --> 00:28:02,484
Yep, you got it. Miss Ouro Kronii.

396
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:05,484
Oh my goodness, what a giving gal.

397
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,384
Thank you, thank you so much, Kronii.

398
00:28:08,384 --> 00:28:10,084
Oh, you're welcome.

399
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:11,084
What? Anyway,

400
00:28:11,084 --> 00:28:16,484
let's get on with the show, with the commercial break! Woohoo!

401
00:28:19,084 --> 00:29:16,084
NOWLOADING...

402
00:28:50,684 --> 00:28:52,584
What are you looking at?

403
00:28:56,784 --> 00:28:58,084
That's right.

404
00:28:58,684 --> 00:29:00,084
Oh!

405
00:29:00,084 --> 00:29:00,684
Oh!

406
00:29:00,684 --> 00:29:01,184
Oh!

407
00:29:01,184 --> 00:29:01,684
Oh!

408
00:29:01,684 --> 00:29:02,884
Oh!

409
00:29:26,784 --> 00:29:30,484
Hey, what is up? I'm here to win!

410
00:29:30,784 --> 00:29:33,984
And you know why? It's because I'm so on point.

411
00:29:31,584 --> 00:29:33,584
BEST Comedian Nronii / Funnyronii

412
00:29:34,384 --> 00:29:38,984
Get it? 'Cause, you know, swords?

413
00:29:40,684 --> 00:29:44,384
I'm so sharp and witty today.

414
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:46,384
Hah! I did it again.

415
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:50,084
Oh man, I'm so silly like that.

416
00:29:50,084 --> 00:29:51,684
It's- it's mind-blowing.

417
00:29:51,684 --> 00:29:54,584
How could I get any better than this?

418
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:58,884
Well, today, I'm gonna be chopping up some fruit

419
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:01,584
and make some fruit salad.

420
00:30:01,897 --> 00:30:03,197
Whoa!

421
00:30:03,197 --> 00:30:05,697
This is gonna be great, it's gonna be a fun time.

422
00:30:06,197 --> 00:30:09,397
Oh! Oh, thank you, Kronie.

423
00:30:10,197 --> 00:30:12,397
What's that? Pineapple?

424
00:30:12,397 --> 00:30:14,897
That's so cute. Thank you.

425
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:19,397
Yeah, I'm gonna be chopping these up for today, so that's gonna be exciting.

426
00:30:20,397 --> 00:30:24,897
Thank you so much for showing it off.

427
00:30:25,897 --> 00:30:29,397
And with that, Kronies, stand by!

428
00:30:30,397 --> 00:30:34,397
All right, good, good, good. Back in position.

429
00:30:35,097 --> 00:30:40,097
It's time to show you all what I got. Music, start! Let's go!

430
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:46,097
Fruits! Come on, let's go!

431
00:30:46,897 --> 00:30:48,397
Hah!

432
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:50,397
Sick, sick, sick.

433
00:30:51,697 --> 00:30:53,397
Hah!

434
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:57,097
Damn, look at that. I'm doing so good.

435
00:30:57,097 --> 00:30:59,697
Look at the accuracy. Insane.

436
00:31:00,897 --> 00:31:01,897
Bam!

437
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:04,397
Whoop, bam!

438
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:07,397
Ugh, look at that.

439
00:31:08,197 --> 00:31:10,697
One shot, one kill.

440
00:31:10,897 --> 00:31:12,397
Look at... amazing.

441
00:31:13,097 --> 00:31:15,897
Oh, oh! Time stop! Ho! Okay. Phew!

442
00:31:18,197 --> 00:31:19,697
Bam!

443
00:31:20,397 --> 00:31:22,897
Um, it's okay. This one's pretty durable.

444
00:31:23,397 --> 00:31:25,397
Hah! Look at that. Okay, nice, nice.

445
00:31:26,397 --> 00:31:28,897
You guys didn't see anything. Perfect.

446
00:31:29,397 --> 00:31:32,897
Just one cut, one clean cut.

447
00:31:33,897 --> 00:31:37,697
Oh, man! That was great and all, but you know...

448
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:43,097
...I'm kind of not feeling it. I wish I could spice things up, but I don't know how.

449
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:48,897
Eh... eh...

450
00:31:50,397 --> 00:31:54,397
What... what can I do? What can I do?

451
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:58,397
Oh? What? What?

452
00:31:58,697 --> 00:32:01,897
Guys! You want to join, too?

453
00:32:02,097 --> 00:32:07,397
No, I'm making fruit salad, not clock salad. What the heck?

454
00:32:09,397 --> 00:32:13,397
Sigh... okay. Well, you asked for it.

455
00:32:15,397 --> 00:32:19,097
The things I do. All right, come on up!

456
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:24,397
Hah! Yeah!

457
00:32:26,397 --> 00:32:29,897
You guys are so durable, what the heck? You're so thick.

458
00:32:30,397 --> 00:32:32,397
Lose some weight, bro.

459
00:32:33,397 --> 00:32:36,397
Phew, man, what a... what a hassle.

460
00:32:37,097 --> 00:32:40,897
I'm, like, surrounded by Kronies with some...

461
00:32:40,897 --> 00:32:46,397
woop, weird, weird things that I can't really say on the show.

462
00:32:48,397 --> 00:32:50,897
But anyway, I gotta patch you guys up now.

463
00:32:51,397 --> 00:32:53,097
Hah! Hah!

464
00:32:56,397 --> 00:33:01,397
Okay. See? Good as... good as new. Yay!

465
00:33:02,697 --> 00:33:07,397
You're welcome, guys. Always have to make things weird for me, but you know what?

466
00:33:07,397 --> 00:33:10,397
I'll live with it.

467
00:33:11,397 --> 00:33:15,397
Anyway, I got the stage just a little bit dirty with all the fruit juice...

468
00:33:16,097 --> 00:33:20,897
...oil, maybe? I don't even know. But I hope you all enjoyed it!

469
00:33:22,897 --> 00:33:28,397
And with that, I'm gonna go. Kronie, out! Woo!

470
00:33:29,397 --> 00:33:33,897
Yay! Come on!

471
00:33:36,397 --> 00:33:41,397
Thank you for that stunning display, Ms. Kronii.

472
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:46,097
Um, the stage is a bit soiled with all the fruit juice,

473
00:33:46,097 --> 00:33:49,397
but let's not mind that.

474
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:54,397
Because the next Kronii will help with the mess. Oh, what could that mean?

475
00:33:55,097 --> 00:33:58,697
Oh my goodness, who could the next Kronii be?

476
00:33:59,397 --> 00:34:02,697
But let's not keep the suspense any longer.

477
00:34:03,197 --> 00:34:07,097
Next up, the next Kronii is coming up on stage.

478
00:34:07,097 --> 00:34:10,397
Let's all give her a warm round of applause!

479
00:34:27,897 --> 00:34:32,897
Hey-o, what's up? It's me, Cleaneronii.

480
00:34:29,697 --> 00:34:32,897
Cleaneronii

481
00:34:33,897 --> 00:34:36,897
You know, it's... good to be here.

482
00:34:38,397 --> 00:34:42,897
I think the reason why I should win is because I'm so chill.

483
00:34:43,697 --> 00:34:46,897
Everyone's angry or just so hyper,

484
00:34:46,897 --> 00:34:50,397
and I'm just, like, down with the chillness, you know?

485
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:55,397
And also, I'm here to make this world a cleaner place

486
00:34:55,397 --> 00:35:00,097
with my awesome power washer here. So, yeah, let's...

487
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:04,044
Wash-up, my dunes.

488
00:35:04,044 --> 00:35:06,144
Haha, get it? It's like a pun on what's up,

489
00:35:06,144 --> 00:35:08,344
but I'm washing things, so it's wash-up.

490
00:35:08,344 --> 00:35:10,744
Hahaha! I'm funny too. Damn.

491
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,911
Funny-ronii, watch out.

492
00:35:15,911 --> 00:35:18,011
Okay, anyway, let's get this job done and over with.

493
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:19,511
Let's do this! Woohoo!

494
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:32,011
Alright, I'm here to wash. Let's do this! Woohoo!

495
00:35:35,911 --> 00:35:37,911
Oh man, this statue is looking so gnarly, bro. Woo!

496
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:45,311
Alright, okay, well, let's begin.

497
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:53,011
Damn, this is like, so dirty, dude.

498
00:35:55,211 --> 00:35:57,544
Is it from the fruit juice? Like, what happened in this place?

499
00:36:00,544 --> 00:36:02,844
Like, man, that's insane.

500
00:36:08,844 --> 00:36:10,744
Man, this statue's so big and I'm just so small.

501
00:36:10,744 --> 00:36:14,044
This world is just so big and I'm like a speck of dust.

502
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:23,244
What am I? Makes me think about life, really.

503
00:36:27,911 --> 00:36:29,711
Oh, okay, looks done.

504
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:32,511
Damn, time passes so fast when I'm just cleaning.

505
00:36:35,511 --> 00:36:37,544
Damn. But yeah, that looks great.

506
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:41,044
Oh, what? There's another one?

507
00:36:43,044 --> 00:36:44,744
Okay, well, actually I'm not complaining.

508
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,444
More cleaning for me! Woohoo!

509
00:36:46,444 --> 00:36:48,244
Let's go! Yay!

510
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:51,944
Phew! Okay, well...

511
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,144
...let's go. One last ride.

512
00:37:02,544 --> 00:37:04,044
Dude, this is so therapeutic.

513
00:37:05,044 --> 00:37:07,344
Like, I can do this all day, man. Ah.

514
00:37:13,944 --> 00:37:16,244
You know, Kronii's legs are so long.

515
00:37:16,244 --> 00:37:17,744
Like, what does she do?

516
00:37:21,744 --> 00:37:23,244
Just so beautiful.

517
00:37:23,244 --> 00:37:26,644
And her being in gold just makes it so much better,

518
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,911
you know? That's like the best part.

519
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:34,611
Oh, look at that.

520
00:37:37,544 --> 00:37:40,444
Oh, Gold Kronii in all her glory.

521
00:37:42,744 --> 00:37:46,344
It's done. It's done, it's my masterpiece. Phew!

522
00:37:48,544 --> 00:37:50,544
Well, it seems like my work here is done

523
00:37:50,544 --> 00:37:53,744
with all these beautiful statues restored to its former glory.

524
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:02,144
Man, if you need any help, you can call me anytime.

525
00:38:02,144 --> 00:38:04,711
I'm just gonna wash everything like pshow pshow pshow.

526
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:12,711
It's gonna be dun-zo because I'm just so amazing like that.

527
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:17,744
Rock on, bro.

528
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:21,644
And you know, I hope that as quick as it was

529
00:38:21,644 --> 00:38:23,244
because of my pro skills,

530
00:38:23,244 --> 00:38:26,644
I hope everybody enjoyed this therapy session

531
00:38:28,644 --> 00:38:30,744
'cause it always is therapeutic for me.

532
00:38:36,244 --> 00:38:38,911
So yeah, with that, I'm gonna bid you adieu, my dunes.

533
00:38:41,911 --> 00:38:43,244
See you around. Or not.

534
00:38:45,244 --> 00:38:47,544
Alright, bye-bye. Pshow pshow pshow. Yay!

535
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:57,944
Ooh! Look at her! Wow!

536
00:38:58,944 --> 00:39:01,244
The stage is now squeaky clean. Look at that.

537
00:39:03,244 --> 00:39:05,644
I can almost see the reflection of myself.

538
00:39:07,644 --> 00:39:10,044
Oh my goodness, your eyes are beautiful.

539
00:39:11,544 --> 00:39:14,644
Ah, okay, anyway, thank you so much to Powerwash Kronii!

540
00:39:19,544 --> 00:39:22,344
And that is all the performances we have for today.

541
00:39:23,344 --> 00:39:25,744
I know, I know, already? Oh well.

542
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:31,744
But thank you to our fellow participants for showing off

543
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,944
your beautiful, stunning abilities.

544
00:39:36,944 --> 00:39:39,544
No wonder there were four Kroniis because

545
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:43,444
if we were to show off one Kronii, then this would have taken forever.

546
00:39:46,444 --> 00:39:49,644
How could we just, you know, narrow it down to just one hour?

547
00:39:49,644 --> 00:39:51,944
It's gonna be like six hours, or 48 hours,

548
00:39:53,944 --> 00:39:55,844
or God knows how long. But yeah...

549
00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:05,625
It's lucky for you guys or...

550
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:08,025
...unlucky? I don't know.

551
00:40:08,425 --> 00:40:12,125
But anyway, let's move on to the award ceremony!

552
00:40:12,425 --> 00:40:14,325
Woohoo! Let's go!

553
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:25,025
And there we have it!

554
00:40:25,325 --> 00:40:29,025
Those were all the performances we had for tonight.

555
00:40:31,025 --> 00:40:33,325
What a... amazing turnout.

556
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:37,025
As expected from me, obviously.

557
00:40:39,325 --> 00:40:43,025
Now now, if our fabulous guests are lucky...

558
00:40:43,725 --> 00:40:46,725
...they might have the chance of grabbing...

559
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:50,025
...this absolutely glorious Kronii statue...

560
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:55,525
...endorsed by, again, me, Kronii.

561
00:40:56,425 --> 00:40:59,025
And oh, it's so shiny.

562
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:01,525
Gosh, I wish I could get one.

563
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:05,025
But I'm not participating, so... oh well.

564
00:41:07,025 --> 00:41:11,025
But with that, let's hear from the nominees, their thoughts...

565
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:14,025
...on their stunning performances tonight.

566
00:41:15,025 --> 00:41:18,025
To start us off, let's hear from Qronii.

567
00:41:19,525 --> 00:41:21,525
BEST ACT Qronii

568
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:23,525
Qronii

569
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:23,525
I felt a little bit of heat towards the end...

570
00:41:24,425 --> 00:41:29,025
...but I really do feel like I conveyed the feelings of Kronii...

571
00:41:29,425 --> 00:41:31,025
...very much so.

572
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:36,025
At the end of it all, I truly believe all Kroniis...

573
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:40,025
...are beautiful in their own respective ways.

574
00:41:40,525 --> 00:41:43,725
These amazing qualities of mine...

575
00:41:43,825 --> 00:41:48,525
...understanding, humble, and most of all, attractive.

576
00:41:49,025 --> 00:41:52,325
Oh, what defines me as a supreme overlord.

577
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:56,525
Everyone loves me because who wouldn't?

578
00:41:57,025 --> 00:42:01,025
They should all bow before my raw awesomeness.

579
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:07,025
And because of that, and only for that reason...

580
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,025
...I deserve the award.

581
00:42:11,225 --> 00:42:13,025
Ah, slaaaay!

582
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:19,025
Thank you, Qronii. How humble of you.

583
00:42:20,025 --> 00:42:24,525
Wow. Um, I think... but I love the apple, by the way.

584
00:42:26,425 --> 00:42:29,025
Can I... can I touch it?

585
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:33,025
Ooh. Oh my God, that's... that is amazing.

586
00:42:34,525 --> 00:42:37,525
That is fresh. Damn.

587
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:41,525
Ooh. Okay, I'm too mesmerized.

588
00:42:45,025 --> 00:42:49,025
Anyway, up next is Singronii. Let's hear it!

589
00:42:51,525 --> 00:42:53,525
BEST SING Singronii

590
00:42:52,525 --> 00:42:55,525
Singronii

591
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:56,525
I feel like I tried to do my best.

592
00:42:58,025 --> 00:43:01,525
Um, I hope it shows and... um...

593
00:43:02,025 --> 00:43:06,025
...you know, I guess for that effort...

594
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:10,025
...it would be an honor to receive the award.

595
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:14,025
But, uh, if not, that's... that's okay.

596
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:19,025
Um, I guess I'll just try harder next time.

597
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:23,025
Um, I mean, I've been practicing...

598
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:28,025
...uh, so you know, maybe next time I'll do much better...

599
00:43:28,425 --> 00:43:30,525
...and... win.

600
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:36,025
I guess I just gotta do better. Just just do better, right?

601
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:37,525
Heh. Yeah. Yeah.

602
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:42,525
Um, anyway, I should just pass it over to the next person. Yeah.

603
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:49,525
Singronii, we wish you luck on your idol journey.

604
00:43:50,025 --> 00:43:54,525
And I see what you did there with the idol outfit.

605
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:58,025
Clever, very clever. Cute, too. Ooh.

606
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:05,025
Okay, she looks like she's about to cry...

607
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:07,525
...so let's just move on right here, okay?

608
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:14,025
Funnyronii, let's hear what kind of words you have to say...

609
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,025
...about today's performance.

610
00:44:15,525 --> 00:44:17,525
BEST Comedian Funnyronii

611
00:44:16,525 --> 00:44:19,525
Funnyronii

612
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:20,525
If you don't think that I deserve it...

613
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:24,525
...then I think you need to have better taste in humor...

614
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:29,025
...because you lack common sense and any reason...

615
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,525
...an average human is supposed to have.

616
00:44:34,025 --> 00:44:37,525
And besides, did you see the Kroniis?

617
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:41,025
They seemed to have liked it.

618
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:45,525
Like, I mean, they were literally jumping at the opportunity...

619
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:48,025
...to be part of the performance.

620
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:52,525
And sure, they ended up in the hospital and they're suffering...

621
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:57,525
...um, and all that fun stuff, but that's entertainment for ya...

622
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:59,025
...you know? No pain, no gain.

623
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:02,525
And there was a lot of gain to be had.

624
00:45:04,171 --> 00:45:05,001
What exactly is it?

625
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:06,251
I'm not going to tell you that.

626
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:08,001
You gotta find the answer yourself, buddy!

627
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:16,839
Since you're the funny one here,

628
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:21,331
I'll go ahead and assume you're joking there.

629
00:45:23,141 --> 00:45:23,931
No?

630
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:26,001
Okay... just gonna pretend I didn't hear that.

631
00:45:26,001 --> 00:45:29,981
But if you don't win this time,

632
00:45:29,981 --> 00:45:33,671
you're definitely in the running for...

633
00:45:33,671 --> 00:45:39,361
...most humble next to Kronii over there.

634
00:45:41,981 --> 00:45:44,221
Last but not least,

635
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:47,339
let's hear it from Cleaneronii!

636
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:50,139
Cleaneronii

637
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,139
BEST wash Kronii

638
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,341
Ugh... like...

639
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:58,171
it was such a radical experience, dude.

640
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,841
I felt like...

641
00:46:01,841 --> 00:46:06,721
my soul was being cleansed...

642
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:10,171
along with the dirt.

643
00:46:11,421 --> 00:46:15,961
Like... totally tubular, man.

644
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:18,061
I was like...

645
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:21,561
going off on those statues like...

646
00:46:21,561 --> 00:46:22,721
Kachow!

647
00:46:22,721 --> 00:46:24,561
Kachow!

648
00:46:24,561 --> 00:46:27,961
You know... like...

649
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:30,171
dude...

650
00:46:30,171 --> 00:46:33,841
it was like a swell time.

651
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:36,251
I was like...

652
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:41,061
frothing at the mouth almost because...

653
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:42,841
like...

654
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:43,981
dude...

655
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:45,981
that was like...

656
00:46:45,981 --> 00:46:48,171
the mother pearl...

657
00:46:48,171 --> 00:46:51,171
the mother pearl kind of experience, you know?

658
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,339
Yeah... Yeah, you get me. Yeah.

659
00:46:56,171 --> 00:46:58,839
And there we have it!

660
00:47:00,181 --> 00:47:04,171
Um, thank you for all your rather

661
00:47:04,171 --> 00:47:05,839
interesting speeches.

662
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,961
I'm sure someone out there,

663
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:11,341
far, far out there,

664
00:47:11,341 --> 00:47:14,171
will find them heartwarming.

665
00:47:14,171 --> 00:47:15,561
Maybe.

666
00:47:16,339 --> 00:47:17,961
You know what?

667
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:21,341
Since I'm here, I think I'll make a little speech too.

668
00:47:21,341 --> 00:47:23,841
You know, why not?

669
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,341
After all, I did my hair extra special

670
00:47:26,341 --> 00:47:29,961
for today and everything.

671
00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:33,181
So, I deserve it

672
00:47:33,181 --> 00:47:36,251
because I was the main organizer, first of all.

673
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:39,961
And also, I'm the only Kronii here with a clock.

674
00:47:39,961 --> 00:47:43,341
Yes, I made it extra large for today.

675
00:47:43,341 --> 00:47:45,961
And I came prepared,

676
00:47:45,961 --> 00:47:50,171
and I honestly look the best out of everyone here.

677
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:51,341
No offense.

678
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:54,341
I'm not saying that I'm part of the candidates,

679
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:59,341
but if I was, I would be the MVP here.

680
00:48:02,841 --> 00:48:06,171
You know, that's all from me though.

681
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:13,341
Oh, you guys! Oh, stop it.

682
00:48:13,341 --> 00:48:16,721
You don't have to give me those charming looks.

683
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:18,341
I know.

684
00:48:18,341 --> 00:48:20,961
I know I'm pretty amazing,

685
00:48:20,961 --> 00:48:22,961
cool, talented,

686
00:48:22,961 --> 00:48:26,251
absolutely just out of this world and...

687
00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:29,341
Oh! Oh.

688
00:48:29,341 --> 00:48:33,171
It looks like we're finally ready

689
00:48:33,171 --> 00:48:34,339
to announce the winner.

690
00:48:35,251 --> 00:48:38,171
The votes are in, the polls are shut,

691
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:40,961
and without further ado,

692
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:44,341
the Kroniis have decided.

693
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,341
The winner of this time's glorious

694
00:48:48,341 --> 00:48:51,339
Kronii Awards Award Show...

695
00:48:57,961 --> 00:49:01,341
See, who could it be?

696
00:49:01,341 --> 00:49:04,961
Who... who could it be?

697
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:11,341
It's me!

698
00:49:14,721 --> 00:49:15,961
Ah, yes.

699
00:49:15,961 --> 00:49:18,961
My baby is finally here.

700
00:49:18,961 --> 00:49:22,171
Back home in my arms.

701
00:49:22,171 --> 00:49:25,171
Thank you so much for this award,

702
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:29,341
and I'd like to thank everybody who made this possible.

703
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:32,171
And not you guys...

704
00:49:32,171 --> 00:49:35,251
...me, myself, and I!

705
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:36,961
What?!

706
00:49:36,961 --> 00:49:38,341
No way!

707
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:40,171
How is that even possible?

708
00:49:40,171 --> 00:49:41,961
This is rigged!

709
00:49:41,961 --> 00:49:43,721
I mean, you were the host!

710
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:45,341
And besides, we don't know...

711
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:46,961
...what you're talking about.

712
00:49:46,961 --> 00:49:48,171
This is just...

713
00:49:48,171 --> 00:49:50,171
I think I'm going to be sick!

714
00:49:51,331 --> 00:49:52,981
Shut up!

715
00:49:52,981 --> 00:49:56,171
Of course I have to win!

716
00:49:56,171 --> 00:49:57,961
Who's the one that planned all this, huh?

717
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,961
Look around! Say "wha"!

718
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:02,839
Yeah.

719
00:50:03,154 --> 00:50:03,954
So...

720
00:50:04,454 --> 00:50:06,254
Sorry, I can't hear

721
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:10,654
because it seems like your mics
have suddenly stopped working.

722
00:50:11,654 --> 00:50:13,654
Oh, what a shame.

723
00:50:14,954 --> 00:50:17,654
And oh, oh look at that. The show's ending.

724
00:50:17,654 --> 00:50:20,654
Oh, oh no, oh no.

725
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:23,654
Thank you to everyone who tuned in

726
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:26,154
and stay safe out there.

727
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:29,654
And remember, maybe next time,

728
00:50:29,954 --> 00:50:35,154
you too could be right here,
standing where I'm standing.

729
00:50:36,654 --> 00:50:38,654
One day, maybe.

730
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,654
Nah, who am I kidding? Bye!

731
00:51:06,654 --> 00:51:13,154
So, how was it? Aren't I just amazing?

732
00:51:13,954 --> 00:51:17,954
Thank you so much for watching up to this point.

733
00:51:19,654 --> 00:51:23,154
And now, a few announcements here.

734
00:51:23,154 --> 00:51:26,654
What do you think it's going to be? Let's see.

735
00:51:29,654 --> 00:51:30,654
Bam!

736
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:35,154
Warden's Capely Embrace Blanket

737
00:51:31,654 --> 00:51:35,954
It's a blanket! And not just any blanket.

738
00:51:36,154 --> 00:51:41,654
It's inspired by my cape.
That's right. Look at this.

739
00:51:43,654 --> 00:51:46,954
But, you'll have to wait a little bit longer.

740
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,954
I know you want this cape ASAP,

741
00:51:50,154 --> 00:51:53,154
but you can get it after the 3D group collab.

742
00:51:53,154 --> 00:51:56,154
So keep an eye out for that, okay? Yay!

743
00:51:57,154 --> 00:52:02,154
And now, you can join my club, Cape Gang. Woohoo!

744
00:52:02,654 --> 00:52:06,154
So, what are you waiting for? Go get it right now.

745
00:52:06,654 --> 00:52:08,654
Don't you want this cape?

746
00:52:09,154 --> 00:52:12,654
It's going to be available
as soon as this showcase ends,

747
00:52:12,654 --> 00:52:14,954
so keep an eye out for that, okay?

748
00:52:17,154 --> 00:52:20,654
Um, but before we end things,

749
00:52:20,654 --> 00:52:23,654
I have a short message for everyone.

750
00:52:25,154 --> 00:52:31,154
Yeah, I know. Ooh, sudden unplanned stuff. Oh my.

751
00:52:32,654 --> 00:52:36,154
Okay, well, you guys want to see a magic trick?

752
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:40,654
I don't have anything in my hands right now, but...

753
00:52:43,154 --> 00:52:46,654
Now I do! Whoa, magic!

754
00:52:48,154 --> 00:52:51,654
All right, let's see. Um...

755
00:52:52,154 --> 00:52:55,654
Yeah, okay. Time to read this letter.

756
00:52:57,654 --> 00:53:01,654
So, I never would have expected
to ever be here

757
00:53:01,954 --> 00:53:03,954
years before all this.

758
00:53:04,954 --> 00:53:09,154
And because of you guys,
I'm able to have this chance

759
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:12,654
to experience so many new things

760
00:53:12,954 --> 00:53:16,654
and meet so many people in just one lifetime.

761
00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:21,654
So, thank you for helping me
break out of my shell,

762
00:53:22,154 --> 00:53:28,154
and I hope we can continue
accomplishing great things together.

763
00:53:29,654 --> 00:53:33,154
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

764
00:53:34,154 --> 00:53:38,654
Well, time to get that
sappy stuff out of the way. Um...

765
00:53:40,654 --> 00:53:43,654
Okay, but before we end things off,

766
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:47,654
let's finish it off with a song. Let's go!

767
00:53:49,154 --> 00:53:54,654
And the final song is going to be
from one of my favorite animes

768
00:53:54,954 --> 00:53:58,654
and it's going to be called Eternal Snow.

769
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:02,154
So please give it a listen. Thank you.

770
00:54:36,954 --> 00:54:38,154
いつの間に...
Before I knew it...

771
00:54:38,654 --> 00:54:43,154
君のことを好きになって
I've fallen in love with you.

772
00:54:43,354 --> 00:54:45,654
どれくらいたつのかな
I wonder how much time has passed.

773
00:54:45,954 --> 00:54:54,154
気持ち膨らんでゆくばかりで
My feelings just keep growing,

774
00:54:54,654 --> 00:55:02,654
君はこの想い気付いているのかな
and I wonder if you've noticed these feelings.

775
00:55:03,469 --> 00:59:34,469
ETERNAL SNOW

776
00:55:03,594 --> 00:55:11,594
一度も言葉にはしてないけど
I've never put it into words before,

777
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:20,969
雪のように静かに
Silently like the snow,

778
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:30,719
降り積もり続けてゆく
It just keeps falling and piling up.

779
00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:40,119
Hold me tight こんな思いなら
Hold me tight, if it was going to be like this,

780
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:50,219
誰かを好きになる気持ち 知りたくなかったよ
I didn't want to know the feeling of falling in love.

781
00:55:50,669 --> 00:55:58,619
I love you 涙止まらない
I love you, the tears won't stop,

782
00:55:59,419 --> 00:56:11,469
こんなんじゃ 君のこと知らずにいれば良かったよ
If it's like this, I wish I'd never known you.

783
00:56:21,819 --> 00:56:30,019
君をいつまで想っているのかな
How long will I keep thinking of you?

784
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:39,319
ため息が窓ガラスを曇らせた
My sighs have clouded up the window glass.

785
00:56:40,219 --> 00:56:48,319
揺れる心 灯すキャンドルで
With the candle lighting my trembling heart,
