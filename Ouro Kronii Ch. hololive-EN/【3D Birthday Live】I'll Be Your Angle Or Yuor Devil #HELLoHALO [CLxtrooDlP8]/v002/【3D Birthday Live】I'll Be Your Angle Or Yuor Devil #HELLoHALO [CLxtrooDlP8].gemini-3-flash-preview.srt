I was afraid

11
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,300

I'm happy that we were able to meet

25

あなたの中の私の存在は
My presence inside of you

35
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000

わかってるけれど
I know that, but

37
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
今この同じ瞬間
Right now, this same moment

38
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,100
共有してる実感
The feeling of sharing it

39

くらくらり くらくらる
Dizzy, dizzying

42
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:09,216
あなたを見上げたら それだけで
Just looking up at you

43
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:11,516
まぶしすぎて いたい
It's so bright it hurts

44
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:13,966
くらくらる くらくらり
Dizzying, dizzy

45
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:16,966
あなたを思っている それだけで
Just thinking of you

46
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,466
溶けてしまいそう
I feel like I'm melting

47
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:23,316

Um, hello.

73
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:30,566
Um, my name is Singeroni.

74
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:34,566
I heard that people enjoyed my first appearance before,

75
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:38,066
and I'm really thankful for that.

76
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:42,566
So this time, I wanted to sing for you guys,

77
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:45,566
if it's okay, that is.

78
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,066
Um, as for where we are right now...

79
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:54,066
Uh, I'm not really sure where I am at the moment.

80
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:58,566
It seems sort of grand,

81
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:01,566
which makes me kind of self-conscious.

82
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:06,066
I uh... never sang Renai Circulation up until now...

83
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:10,566
...since I never thought I could manage songs that are cute and,

84
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:14,566
how should I say, "fua fua"?

85
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:18,066
I hope it sounded okay.

86
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:22,066
Um... I wonder if I'm missing anything else.

87
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:25,566
Oh, right! Uh, be sure to use the hashtag

88
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:28,566
#HELLoHALO.

89
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:32,066
I came up with it myself.

90
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:35,566
I thought I was being pretty clever.

91
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:37,566
What's happening?

92
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:39,566
What?

93
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,566
What's going—

94
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,566
Am I...

95
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:49,066
Huh? Wait, am I dead?

96
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:53,066
What did I do?

97
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,566
Why?

98
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:58,566
All of a sudden?

99
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:03,566
Well, I mean, bright side,

100
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:08,566
at least this place was nice enough to end up here.

101
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:12,566
So that's— that's good.

102
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:18,066
Well... regardless, I still prepared,

103
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:21,066
so I'm gonna perform...

104
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:26,566
...'cause I want to give back to you guys, live or dead.

105
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:31,066

00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:08,316
もう何があっても
No matter what happens now,

190
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:11,516
挫けない
I won't give up.

191

気がつけば優しく包まれてた

何もかもが歪んだ世界で
In a world where everything was distorted,

194
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:42,616
唯一信じられるここが救いだった

喜びも悲しみも
Both joy and sadness,

196
00:15:47,366 --> 00:15:52,916
分け合えば強まる想い
If we share them, our feelings grow stronger.

197
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:58,416
この声が届くのなら
If this voice reaches you,

198
00:15:58,516 --> 00:16:04,516
きっと奇跡は起こせるだろう
I'm sure we can make a miracle happen.

199

押し寄せた闇振り払って進むよ
I'll push aside the encroaching darkness and move forward.

202

203

壊れた世界で彷徨って私は
Wandering in a broken world, I...

204
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:12,416
引き寄せられるようにたどり着いた
...arrived as if drawn here.

205
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:17,466
目覚めた心は走り出した
My awakened heart began to run,

206
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:20,516
未来を描くため
to paint the future.

207
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:25,616
難しい道で立ち止まっても
Even if I stop on a difficult path,

208
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:31,816
空はきれいな青でいつも待っててくれる
the sky is a beautiful blue, always waiting for me.

209
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:35,016
だから怖くない
So I'm not afraid.

210
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:40,516
もう何があっても挫けない
No matter what happens now, I won't give up.

211
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:47,416
ずっとあした待って
Always waiting for tomorrow.

212
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:22,316
Hey, what are you doing here again?

213
00:18:22,516 --> 00:18:26,916
Are you trying to upstage me here of all places?

214
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:33,516
Umm, I don't think it comes off...

215
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:40,316
Well, you know, I refuse to let that happen.

216
00:18:40,716 --> 00:18:44,316
After all, I'm Ouro Kronii!

217
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:58,516
Wh-wh-ar-are you seeing what I'm seeing right now?

218
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,516
Yeah... oh geez.

219
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:08,616
You two down there. Yes, you.

220
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:15,616
Uh, hello? I'm right here. Uh, rude.

221
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:20,416
One of you does not belong here.

222
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,116
Oh. Yeah, that's right.

223
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:28,116
Get out of here!

224
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:34,516
Oh, yeah. Whatever you want to believe, I guess.

225
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:41,416
Anyway, behold a stage more fitting for the likes of you.

226
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:48,916
Oh. I mean, of course.

227
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:55,316
Of course I'm the more angelic and kind-hearted one, of course.

228
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:59,716
Oh man, you are so based.

229
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:02,241
Thank you guys, thank you.

230
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:03,141
Oh...

231
00:20:03,141 --> 00:20:04,741
Oh man...

232
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:06,241
Bless.

233
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:07,841
Love.

234
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:09,641
Thank you.

235
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:42,641
Wait...

236
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:47,141
Wait, I'm the devil?

237
00:20:48,141 --> 00:20:52,141
Bro, oh geez, she blind for real for real.

238
00:20:52,641 --> 00:20:56,641
What, me? That... that doesn't make any sense.

239
00:20:58,141 --> 00:20:59,641
What?

240
00:21:01,641 --> 00:21:03,641
Hey, come over here.

241
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:05,641
Yeah, you. Yeah, come here.

242
00:21:05,941 --> 00:21:08,641
What are you looking at? Huh?

243
00:21:08,841 --> 00:21:13,141
Stupid little thing, huh? Smug, you like that, huh?

244
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:17,441
You're... you're just a little wannabe of mine.

245
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:21,141
You know, I don't like you. Get... get out of here!

246
00:21:22,141 --> 00:21:27,641
God, always want to take the spotlight for some reason. Disgusting.

247
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:35,641
Well... I mean, at least I still look pretty damn good.

248
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:37,141
Sheesh!

249
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,641
Okay, there we go.

250
00:21:57,141 --> 00:22:04,141
あたしヴァンパイア　いいの？　吸っちゃっていいの？
「もう無理もう無理」なんて　悪い子だね
I'm a vampire. Is it okay? Can I suck your blood?
Saying "I can't take it anymore," what a bad child.

251
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:11,141
試したいな　いっぱいいっぱいしたいな
君と僕とで絶頂いけるよ
I want to try it. I want to do it more and more.
You and I can reach the climax.

253
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:28,141
最低最高ずっと行き来してる
甘くなる不安の果実
Going back and forth between the lowest and highest.
The fruit of anxiety that becomes sweet.

254
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:34,141
No more　安静っとして息をしても
いらない　頂ける　受けるだけ
No more. Even if I stay still and breathe,
I don't need it. Just take it, just receive it.

255
00:22:34,141 --> 00:22:39,141
誰かと居れば　其れを足れば
強がってたって気持ちには逆らえない
If I'm with someone, if that's enough,
even if I pretend to be strong, I can't go against my feelings.

256
00:22:39,141 --> 00:22:46,141
離れていても　感じてるエモ
繋がってたしかめたら死ねるかも
Even if we're apart, I feel the "emo".
If we connect and confirm it, I might die.

257
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:54,141
良いもん　悲しいもん　虚しいもん
君のすべてを喰らうまで　絶叫
It's okay. It's sad. It's empty.
Until I devour all of you, scream.

258
00:22:54,141 --> 00:23:00,141
あたしヴァンパイア　いいの？　吸っちゃっていいの？
「もう無理もう無理」なんて　悪い子だね
I'm a vampire. Is it okay? Can I suck your blood?
Saying "I can't take it anymore," what a bad child.

259
00:23:00,141 --> 00:23:06,141
試したいな　いっぱいいっぱいしたいな
君と僕とで絶頂いけるよ
I want to try it. I want to do it more and more.
You and I can reach the climax.

260
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:12,141
求めちゃってまたしちゃって　汚れたような感じ
Seeking, doing it again, feeling like I've become dirty.

261
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:18,141
泣いて忘れたら「はじめまして」
If I cry and forget, then it's "nice to meet you".

262
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:26,141
愛情を注ぐまで　絶対いけるよ
あたしヴァンパイア　まずはこっちおいで
Until I pour out my love, we can definitely make it.
I'm a vampire, first, come here.

263
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:38,141
内緒の想い　洗いざらい　吐き出したなら　まさに裸足
Secret feelings, if I spill them all, it's just like being barefoot.

264
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:44,141
割り切れないけど　余りじゃない
そっと温めてトドメを
I can't divide it, but it's not the remainder.
Gently warm it up and finish it off.

265
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:50,141
繰り返す夜　我儘はタダ
欲張ってまたチャンスを逃すのだ
Repeated nights, selfishness is free.
Being greedy and missing the chance again.

266
00:23:50,141 --> 00:23:57,141
止まないもしも　叶えたいけど
重なって押しつぶされちゃうのかも
Endless "what ifs", I want them to come true, but
they might pile up and crush me.

267
00:23:57,141 --> 00:24:04,141
良いもん　悲しいもん　虚しいもん
君のすべてを喰らうまで
It's okay. It's sad. It's empty.
Until I devour all of you.

268
00:24:04,141 --> 00:24:10,141
良いじゃん　気持ちじゃん
溺れるまで癖になるね　絶叫
It's fine. It's about feelings.
It'll become a habit until I drown. Scream.

269
00:24:10,141 --> 00:24:16,141
あたしヴァンパイア　いいの？　吸っちゃっていいの？
「もう無理もう無理」なんて　悪い子だね
I'm a vampire. Is it okay? Can I suck your blood?
Saying "I can't take it anymore," what a bad child.

270

試したいな　いっぱいいっぱいしたいな
君と僕とで絶頂いけるよ
I want to try it. I want to do it more and more.
You and I can reach the climax.

271
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:27,141
君もヴァンパイア　いいよ吸っちゃっていいよ
「もう無理もう無理」だって言わせたい
You're a vampire too. It's okay, you can suck my blood.
I want to make you say "I can't take it anymore."

272
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:33,141
君以外では　絶対いけない
ほら絶叫させてよ
I can't go with anyone but you.
Come on, let me scream.

273
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:39,141
求めちゃってまたしちゃって　何回目？
Seeking, doing it again, how many times has it been?

274
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:45,141
毒が見えるような罠の中で
In a trap where you can see poison.

275
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:51,141
愛情を注ぐまで　絶対いけるよ
Until I pour out my love, we can definitely make it.

276
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:57,141
君もヴァンパイア　まずはこっちおいで
You're a vampire too, first, come here.

277
00:25:03,366 --> 00:25:03,966
Hi!

278
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,666
How are people doing?

279
00:25:05,866 --> 00:25:06,966
Alright!

280
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:09,166
邪魔ままま
Get out of my way-way-way

285
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:28,266
ライト目が降って無様に砕かれる
Lights rain down, leaving me shattered in disgrace

286
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:29,466
(ba-ba-ba)

287
00:25:29,516 --> 00:25:30,966
そんな将来
Such a future

288
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:33,866
ハイに気ままに lonely lonely
High and carefree, lonely lonely

289
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:36,766
空いた言葉で rollin' rollin'
With empty words, rollin' rollin'

290
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:39,766
愛も変わらず後悔なんてない
Love remains the same, with no regrets

291
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:41,966
Hey, it’s amazing. (nanana)

292
00:25:42,016 --> 00:25:44,366
Ready, this is lover baby

293
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:47,566
愛のその 迫り来る 引く手に
Towards that love, to the hands closing in and pulling

294
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:49,966
まさに this is lover crazy
Truly, this is lover crazy

295
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:53,666
愛のその 人の目は アイアイアイヤ
In that love, people's eyes, ai-ai-ai-ya

296
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:57,766
愛してる 過ぎたことまで 好きすぎる
I love you, I love even the things of the past too much

297
00:25:57,866 --> 00:26:00,466
ひとつ ふたつで bye-bye loving you
One, two, and bye-bye loving you

298
00:26:00,566 --> 00:26:03,766
そんな言葉で そんなことして
With those words, doing those things

299
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:06,166
邪魔ままま
Get out of my way-way-way

300
00:26:15,966 --> 00:26:18,566
ヒッチュートライラブマニア
Hit, true, try, love mania

301
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:21,566
全部泣き言重ねて
Piling up all my complaints

302
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:24,566
ハイファイ超えてオーライアイヤ
Go beyond hi-fi, alright-ai-ya

303
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,566
演技真似て 灰は隠して
Imitating a performance, hiding the ashes

304
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:30,566
三つ重ねて lonely lonely
Three layers deep, lonely lonely

305
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:33,566
きっとあなたは lonely lonely
I'm sure you are lonely lonely

306
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:36,266
愛も変わらず後悔なんてない
Love remains the same, with no regrets

307
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:38,266
Hey, it’s amazing. (nanana)

308
00:26:38,316 --> 00:26:40,566
Ready, this is lover baby

309
00:26:40,616 --> 00:26:43,866
愛のその 迫り来る 引く手に
Towards that love, to the hands closing in and pulling

310
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,066
まさに this is lover crazy
Truly, this is lover crazy

311
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:49,766
愛のその 人の目は アイアイアイヤ

ひとつ ふたつで bye-bye loving you
One, two, and bye-bye loving you

314
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,966
そんな言葉で そんなことして
With those words, doing those things

315
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:02,166
邪魔ままま
Get out of my way-way-way

316

ゴーストルール / Lyrics・Composition: DECO*27
Ghost Rule / Lyrics・Composition: DECO*27

317
00:27:41,966 --> 00:27:44,266
どうだっていいことを
The things that don't matter

318
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:47,066
嘘って吐いて戻れない
I spat them out as lies, and now I can't go back

319
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,066
時効なんてやってこない
The statute of limitations will never come

320
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:51,066
奪ったように奪われた
Stolen away just as I had stolen

321
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,066
今日だって叶わない
Even today, it won't come true

322
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,466
思ったように騙せない
I can't deceive the way I want to

323
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:57,866
腐っている僕には
For someone as rotten as me

324
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:00,266
腐ったものがわからない
I can't tell what's rotten

325
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:03,466
おいで ここまで
Come here, this far

326
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:08,666
捨-い
D-i-e

327
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:11,866
隠してしまったんだ
I've hidden it away

328
00:28:11,966 --> 00:28:14,266
メーデー 僕を殺しても
Mayday, even if you kill me

329
00:28:14,366 --> 00:28:16,866
もう抱きしめなくていいんだよ
You don't have to hold me anymore

330
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:19,066
ねえ メーデー 僕を暴いたら
Hey, Mayday, if you expose me

331
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:21,966
もう一度笑ってくれるかな
I wonder if you'll smile for me once more

332
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:27,566
僕をどうして知るんだよ
Why do you even know me?

333
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:30,166
嘘だって知るんだよ ねえ
I know it's a lie, you know?

334
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:41,266
ノーだって言うはずが
I was supposed to say "no"

335
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:44,066
キョドって YASO 声に出す
But I got jittery and said "yes" out loud

336
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,566
後悔の脆弱は
The fragility of regret

337
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:48,566
騙したほうが正義なの
Is it justice to be the one who deceives?

338
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,866
今日だって叶わない
Even today, it won't come true

339
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:53,266
祈っておいたそれはない
I prayed for it, but it's not there

340
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:55,566
だって言った上司が
Because the boss who said it

341
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,566
墓穴掘って焼ける様
Is digging their own grave and burning

342
00:28:57,666 --> 00:29:00,666
おいで どこまで
Come, how far?

343
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:06,166
墓-い
G-r-e-y

344
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:08,566
被害者面したって
Even if I act like the victim

345
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:11,066
メーデー 僕を叱ってよ
Mayday, please scold me

346
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,566
正直者が夢見たいなら
If the honest want to dream

347
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,866
ねえ メーデー 僕を裁いてよ
Hey, Mayday, please judge me

348
00:29:15,966 --> 00:29:19,566
最後まで甘えきってしまうのは
Indulging myself until the very end

349
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:24,566
亡霊だって知るんだよ
I know it's a ghost

350
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:27,166
空々しくて知るんだよ ねえ
I know it's hollow, you know?

351
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:38,266
足りないものを望んだら
When I wished for what I lacked

352
00:29:38,366 --> 00:29:41,066
僕じゃない僕に出会ったよ
I met a me that wasn't me

353
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:43,266
それでも前に進んだの
But I still moved forward

354
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:45,566
クラクラしちゃう夜も
Even on nights that make me dizzy

355
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:47,866
足りない僕を愛してよ
Love me for what I lack

356
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:50,566
エゴままが僕を育てたの
My ego raised me as it was

357
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:52,566
君には僕が見えるかな
I wonder if you can see me

358
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,866
孤独なピエロが
A lonely clown

359
00:29:54,966 --> 00:29:57,266
メーデー 僕を殺しても
Mayday, even if you kill me

360
00:29:57,366 --> 00:30:00,166
もう抱きしめなくていいんだよ
You don't have to hold me anymore

361
00:30:00,511 --> 00:30:03,191
あー、だんだん、もう一度笑ってくれるかな
Ah, gradually, I wonder if you'll laugh for me one more time.

362
00:30:03,391 --> 00:30:05,291
メーデー　僕を叱ってよ
Mayday, scold me.

363
00:30:05,391 --> 00:30:07,291
正直者が夢見たいなら
If an honest person wants to dream...

364
00:30:07,491 --> 00:30:10,191
ハイ、メーデー　僕を裁いてよ
Hey, mayday, judge me.

365
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:12,491
最後まで甘やかしてしまうのは
To indulge me until the very end...

366
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:14,491
レイデー　僕を暴いてよ
Rayday, expose me.

367
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:17,291
真実を歩くこの世界から
From this world walking on truth.

368
00:30:17,391 --> 00:30:19,491
ハイ、メーデー　僕と踊ってよ
Hey, mayday, dance with me.

369
00:30:19,591 --> 00:30:21,491
最初からいないゴーストだった
I was a ghost who wasn't there from the start.

370
00:30:21,591 --> 00:30:23,291
イェーイ...
Yeah...

371
00:30:23,391 --> 00:30:25,291
ラヴなんだって知れないよ
I don't even know what love is.

372
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,291
イェーイ...
Yeah...

373
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:30,291
嘘つきだって知れないよ
I don't even know if I'm a liar.

374
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:34,491
亡霊だって知れないよ
I don't even know if I'm a ghost.

375
00:30:37,591 --> 00:30:39,291
空白だって知れないよ
I don't even know if I'm a blank space.

376
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:43,191
どうだっていいことを嘘って吐いて戻れない
I spit out lies about things that don't matter and can't go back.

377
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:47,491
時効なんてやってこない　奪ったように奪われて
The statute of limitations never comes, being stolen from just as I stole.

378
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:02,191
And we're back!

379
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:06,191
You know, I'm really starting to like this new me.

380
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:09,191
What do you think? Eh? Eh?

381
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:13,691
I mean, I'm starting to kind of think it's real cool.

382
00:31:15,691 --> 00:31:21,191
And, uh, I just realized I didn't introduce myself properly back there. My bad!

383
00:31:23,691 --> 00:31:28,691
Well, my name is Ouro Kronii and I am the Warden of Time.

384
00:31:29,191 --> 00:31:31,191
Kuro-nichiwa!

385
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:38,191
And I, after much waiting, have finally done it.

386
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:41,191
We're here. We've made it. It's taken a long time.

387
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:46,191
Kroma also apologizes for the delays, but...

388
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:54,191
...finally, my second original song, Souten ni Moyu, will be coming out soon.

389
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:57,191
Sooner than you think.

390
00:31:58,191 --> 00:32:03,191
And thank you so much for waiting. Um, I hope you haven't forgotten it.

391
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:10,191
But yes, here is my second original song, Souten ni Moyu.

392
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:22,191
蒼天に燃ゆ / Lyrics: スピア / Composition・Arrangement: ko.yo
Burning in the Azure Sky / Lyrics: Spia / Composition・Arrangement: ko.yo

393
00:32:29,691 --> 00:32:32,591
其れは俄の夢か
Is that a fleeting dream?

394
00:32:32,691 --> 00:32:35,491
灰色の都　笑われて
Being laughed at in the gray city.

395
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:38,491
噛み締めた尊き声
The precious voice I held back.

396
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:41,391
過去の静寂を灯す
Lighting up the silence of the past.

397
00:32:41,491 --> 00:32:45,191
ダイスを転がして　何時しか繋ぐこの時代
Rolling the dice, connecting this era before I knew it.

398
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:49,191
運命さえ断つだろう　掻き分ける人の波へ
I'll even sever fate, into the waves of people pushing through.

399
00:32:51,691 --> 00:32:56,691
矜持を燃やして　時の声　鐘を鳴らせ
Burn your pride, the voice of time, ring the bell.

400
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:07,491
其の手を伸ばせ　届きそうな明日なんてつまらないだろう
Reach out your hand, a tomorrow that seems reachable is boring, isn't it?

401
00:33:07,591 --> 00:33:13,491
瞳は炎の色　刻み隠した其の業を
Eyes are the color of flames, that karma carved and hidden away.

402
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:18,591
其の手を翳せよ　大概な期待まで
Hold up your hand, even to excessive expectations.

403
00:33:18,691 --> 00:33:24,691
沈む宵闇彩ろどに　限界なんて越えていけ
To the colors of the sinking twilight, go beyond the limits.

404
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:43,191
解き放たれる日まで　戦場を駆けろよ
Until the day I'm set free, run through the battlefield.

405
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:48,491
迷いよ　去れよ　刺激を求ました舞いな
Hesitation, begone, dance as you sought stimulation.

406
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:52,591
弱きを導いた運命のその先へ
To the end of the fate that guided the weak.

407
00:33:52,691 --> 00:33:56,591
ダイスを転がして　流れに身を任せ
Rolling the dice, entrusting myself to the flow.

408
00:33:56,691 --> 00:34:00,591
慈愛さえ断つだろう　想いを研ぎ澄ませて
I'll even sever affection, sharpen your feelings.

409
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:06,391
鋼のように　固めた意思を添えよう
Like steel, let's offer up a hardened will.

410
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:17,391
矜持を構えて　時の声　鐘を鳴らせ
Ready your pride, the voice of time, ring the bell.

411
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:27,591
瞳を抱いて　煌めいて
Embrace your eyes, sparkle.

412
00:34:32,591 --> 00:34:38,391
迷わぬオールイン　弾みで行く　空気が火を滾らせ
Unwavering all-in, going with the momentum, the air makes the fire boil.

413
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:44,391
瞳に不滅の色　其の手に懸けた火にくちづけを
Immortal color in the eyes, a kiss to the fire placed in that hand.

414
00:34:44,491 --> 00:34:50,291
其の手を翳せ　届きそうな明日なんてつまらないだろう
Hold up your hand, a tomorrow that seems reachable is boring, isn't it?

415
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:55,191
瞳は炎の色　刻み隠した其の業を
Eyes are the color of flames, that karma carved and hidden away.

416
00:34:55,291 --> 00:35:00,191
其の手を翳せよ　大概な期待まで
Hold up your hand, even to excessive expectations.

417
00:35:00,216 --> 00:35:01,516
蒼天に燃ゆ
Burning in the blue sky

418
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,316
鏡まで
Even the mirror

419
00:35:02,316 --> 00:35:03,716
登り朝陽を浴び
Rising and bathing in the morning sun

420
00:35:03,716 --> 00:35:05,316
烈火如くに
Like a raging fire

421
00:35:05,316 --> 00:35:06,716
限界なんて
Things like limits...

422
00:35:06,716 --> 00:35:08,716
超えていけー！
Go beyond them!

423
00:35:35,116 --> 00:35:38,416
Whoa, what a banger that song was!

424
00:35:39,716 --> 00:35:41,216
You did great.

425
00:35:41,216 --> 00:35:45,516
Um, I'm really happy seeing how energetic you are.

426
00:35:46,116 --> 00:35:48,616
I know, no need to address the underlying fact.

427
00:35:49,716 --> 00:35:50,616
Okay.

428
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:55,916
But in the end, it doesn't matter who the better one is out of us two.

429
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:58,516
We don't need to compete.

430
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:02,416
B-but I never wanted to compete to begin with.

431
00:36:02,816 --> 00:36:07,616
Because we're all made in the name of beauty and perfection, Kronii.

432
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:10,916
We're all in this together.

433
00:36:12,616 --> 00:36:15,716
And what better way to become perfect...

434
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:18,616
...than by studying the masters, like me.

435
00:36:19,616 --> 00:36:22,016
Well, I have just the thing for you.

436
00:36:22,616 --> 00:36:23,716
Oh boy!

437
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:25,216
Bam!

438
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:28,216
My 2024 birthday merch!

439
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:32,616
Shall we take a look here?

440
00:36:33,516 --> 00:36:36,716
First up, we have "Studying Matters"...

441
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:39,316
...which is a rubber mouse mat,

442
00:36:39,316 --> 00:36:43,216
and you can use it for your keyboard, your mouse,

443
00:36:43,216 --> 00:36:48,516
you can use it for eating, for studying, like for all sorts of things honestly.

444
00:36:54,216 --> 00:36:57,216
And with such beautiful illustration, look at that.

445
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,316
Man.

446
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:02,316
And next up, we have "Plan with Me"...

447
00:37:02,316 --> 00:37:06,816
...which is a whiteboard stand with other bunch of cute chibi illustrations.

448
00:37:07,316 --> 00:37:11,316
This is very useful, you can use it to write down my next stream...

449
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:14,416
...or for your work or for your school,

450
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:18,616
it's very... it's very flexible, you can use it for whatever.

451
00:37:22,216 --> 00:37:24,316
So, um, I'm really excited.

452
00:37:29,516 --> 00:37:32,516
And next up, we have "Maid for Me"...

453
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:36,216
...which is a pencil case in the form of a plushie.

454
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:41,316
You can put all your important supplies there,

455
00:37:41,316 --> 00:37:46,216
like, you know, pens, pencils, erasers,

456
00:37:47,616 --> 00:37:51,516
or, you know, if you're really desperate you can actually use it as a plushie,

457
00:37:51,516 --> 00:37:53,516
put some stuffing into it.

458
00:37:54,216 --> 00:37:55,516
And bam, you got yourself a plushie.

459
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,416
Let's go!

460
00:37:58,716 --> 00:38:01,516
And next, we have "Write with Me"...

461
00:38:01,516 --> 00:38:03,616
...which is a mechanical pencil.

462
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:08,716
Of course, since it's a mechanical pencil, this is going to be reusable,

463
00:38:09,316 --> 00:38:12,916
and 0.5 mm, very accessible for people...

464
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:16,616
...because it's a very common size lead.

465
00:38:17,516 --> 00:38:18,816
So, yeah, it's...

466
00:38:18,816 --> 00:38:19,716
...it's awesome.

467
00:38:20,616 --> 00:38:22,216
Yeah, look forward to...

468
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:24,616
Boris is so cute! Look at that.

469
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:26,316
Look at him.

470
00:38:27,316 --> 00:38:30,516
No thoughts, head empty as usual.

471
00:38:33,616 --> 00:38:36,716
And next up, we also have a voice pack,

472
00:38:36,716 --> 00:38:40,416
which is relevant to the theme "Study with Me",

473
00:38:41,016 --> 00:38:44,416
and this is in English talking about how to use your time well.

474
00:38:45,216 --> 00:38:46,616
I think it's good,

475
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:49,316
obviously because it's done by me.

476
00:38:50,216 --> 00:38:51,916
So do check it out.

477
00:38:55,316 --> 00:38:56,716
And that's not it.

478
00:38:56,716 --> 00:38:57,816
That's...

479
00:38:57,816 --> 00:38:58,816
...there's more!

480
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,616
That's right.

481
00:39:00,216 --> 00:39:02,516
Next up, we have a full set purchase bonus!

482
00:39:03,516 --> 00:39:07,616
And you can have this beautiful illustration as a postcard,

483
00:39:07,616 --> 00:39:09,316
which is going to be so cute.

484
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:11,516
And what's more,

485
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,416
for limited quantity,

486
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:17,216
it's going to be hand-signed by yours truly,

487
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:21,216
so be sure to get it as soon as possible...

488
00:39:21,216 --> 00:39:24,216
...if you want to get, um, hand-signatures from me.

489
00:39:25,316 --> 00:39:26,416
That's right!

490
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:33,216
And all of this is going to go on sale right after this wonderful little live we got here.

491
00:39:33,816 --> 00:39:34,716

00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,516

Okay, well, come over here.
