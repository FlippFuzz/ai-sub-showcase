#INAinaNeverland

5
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,200
迷い込んだ森にある本当
The truth that lies in the forest I've wandered into

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,120
探しに行く月の光
I'm going to search for the moonlight

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,980
羊歯を踏んで足を濡らして
Stepping on ferns, getting my feet wet

8
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,850
ヒトリホトリ夏の小径
Alone by the shore on a summer path

9
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,720
よく笑って泣いて見つめ合って
Laughing, crying, and gazing at each other

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,600
恐る恐る恋に落ちた
Fearfully, we fell in love

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,480
二人歩き出した違う方へ
We both started walking in different directions

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,350
呼び合う声だけ　もどかしく
Frustratingly, only our voices calling to each other

13
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,500
Find me in the wonderland

14
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,700
そろそろ手を汚して
It's about time you got your hands dirty

15
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,580
自分の欲しいものは
The things that you want for yourself

16
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,450
追いかけてみる　三つ編みをほどいて
Try chasing them, undoing your braids

17
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,320
同じ星をかじる
We bite into the same star

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,200
二人きり　寂しかった夜になって
Just the two of us, as the night becomes lonely

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,080
また明るい夢のほとり
Again by the shore of a bright dream

20
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,950
問いかけで残した心だって
Even the heart left behind with a question

21
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,820
ここから始まる歌になる
Will become a song that starts from here

22
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,690
世界は君に
The world belongs to you

23
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,333
世界は君のものさ
The world is yours

24
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,033
どこへ行こうか
Where shall we go?

25
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:05,533
あなたは笑う
You smile

26
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:08,533
踏み外してみようか
Shall we try taking a wrong step?

27
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:11,233
後ろめたさが
The guilt

28
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:13,833
私を誘う
Invites me

29
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:18,033
Finally in your wonderland

30
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:34,533
どうしたって生まれ変わる
No matter what, I'll be reborn

31
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:37,233
ほとばしる強い意志が
A surging strong will

32
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:40,533
偽らば慎重な命だった
If it were a lie, it was a cautious life

33
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:44,233
私だけじゃ道は
With just me, the path is...

34
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:48,333
いつからか星を数え繋ぎ合わせ
Since when did I start counting and connecting stars?

35
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:52,533
また知らない夏の星座
The summer constellations I still don't know

36
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:56,233
見つめ合って泣いて朝になって
Staring at each other, crying, and then morning comes

37
00:05:56,233 --> 00:06:00,533
ここから始まる物語
The story starts from here

38
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:03,533
もう一人じゃないのよ
I'm not alone anymore

39
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:06,533
夢のようでしょ
It's like a dream, right?

40
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,233
私は歌う
I sing

41
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:13,033
寂しさは色を変え
Loneliness changes color

42
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:16,533
旗の下へと
To the base of the flag

43
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:19,533
二人は集う
The two gather

44
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:24,033
何も思い通りにならないことが
The fact that nothing goes as planned

45
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:28,033
始まったから
Has begun

46
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:31,033
踏み外してみようか
Shall we try taking a wrong step?

47
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,833
目隠しを解いて
Removing the blindfold

48
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,533
手の鳴る方へ
To the sound of clapping hands

49
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:41,533
In your wonderland

50
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:58,233
あなたが迷う場所に
In the place where you wander

51
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:02,533
明かりを灯すために
To light a lamp

52
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:06,533
あなたが一つ叩いて
You clap once

53
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:10,533
麗しく笑いましょう
Let's laugh beautifully

54
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:13,533
もう一人じゃないのよ
I'm not alone anymore

55
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,833
とても怖いでしょ幸せなんて
Happiness is very scary, isn't it?

56
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:21,533
寂しさは色を変え
Loneliness changes color

57
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:25,533
旗の下へと
To the base of the flag

58
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:28,033
二人は集う
The two gather

59
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:30,533
世界は君のものさ
The world is yours

60
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,833
手を叩いて
Clap your hands

61
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,033
あなたがいて
With you here

62
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:40,033
踏み外してみようか
Shall we try taking a wrong step?

63
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:42,533
愛する人が
The person I love

64
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,333
私を誘う
Invites me

65
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,033
Finally in your wonderland

66
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:50,033
In your wonderland

67
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:57,533
綺麗な吐息になって
Becoming a beautiful breath

68
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:06,033
あなたの歌を歌って
Singing your song

69
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:44,033
delete

70
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:56,233
優しい言葉を失くした
Lost the kind words

71
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:59,833
闇の中
Inside the darkness

72
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,533
最後の祈りも
Even the final prayer

73
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:09,033
静かに消えてった
Quietly faded away

74
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:13,533
夜明けは遠く 君は独りで
Dawn is far away, and you are alone

75
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:18,533
出口のない夢の中で
Inside a dream with no exit

76
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:23,233
涙だけが道を照らした
Only tears lit the way

77
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:28,533
誰にも届かず
Reaching no one

78
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:33,233
朽ちてゆく歌がある
There is a song that rots away

79
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:37,533
悲しみ一つも
Not even a single sadness

80
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:42,533
叶えられずに終わる
Ends without being fulfilled

81
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:51,533
声もなく君はただ泣いた
Without a voice, you just cried

82
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:04,545
delete

83
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:05,845
ノイズが解けて　時は満ちて
The noise dissolves, the time is ripe

84
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:13,345
遠くが霞む　風も
The distance grows hazy, and the wind

85
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:17,545
数を増した
has increased in strength

86
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:32,245
光をもたらす
Bringing light

87
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:36,545
定めの日は来ない
The day of destiny will not come

88
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:40,545
淀んだ時間は
Stagnant time is

89
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:46,045
まだらに凍りついて
patchy and frozen

90
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:50,045
恐れを説いた　宵闇を手に
Holding the twilight that preached fear

91
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:55,045
抱きしめ合う　形をして
Taking the shape of holding each other

92
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:59,045
君と僕は　傷を重ねた
You and I overlapped our wounds

93
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:03,545
どこにも届かず
Reaching nowhere

94
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:07,545
君の声は潰えた
Your voice has perished

95
00:11:08,045 --> 00:11:11,545
消えゆくことさえ
Even the fact it's fading away

96
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:18,545
誰も気付かぬままに
Without anyone noticing

97
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:25,545
無造作に土を増やした
Casually added to the earth

98
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:41,045
いつか光の中で
One day, in the light

99
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:53,545
そばにいてくれると信じて
Believing that you'll be by my side

100
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:22,545
形のない
Formless

101
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:26,545
僕たちは形のある
We, into a world with form

102
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:30,045
世界へといつか帰る
will return one day

103
00:12:30,245 --> 00:12:33,545
道を捜した
We searched for the path

104
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,045
忘れてしまった
Having forgotten

105
00:12:37,545 --> 00:12:41,545
優しい人の声を捜して
Searching for the voice of a kind person

106
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:47,545
彷徨う道はどこまで遠い
How far the wandering path goes

107
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:51,545
声もなく君はただ泣いた
Without a voice, you just cried

108
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:07,045
道はやがて途絶えた
The path eventually came to an end

109
00:13:35,545 --> 00:13:36,445
Waa!

110
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:39,545
Good morning, afternoon, evening!

111
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:41,845
おはよう、こんにちは、こんばんは！
Good morning, afternoon, evening!

112
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:45,345
Welcome to my birthday live!

113
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:48,845
Yay! It's finally happening!

114
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:52,545
Thank you guys for being so patient.

115
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:57,545
I know this was originally planned for around May, around my birthday,

116
00:13:57,845 --> 00:14:01,045
but it's finally happening in December!

117
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:07,045
Thank you so much everyone for being patient and supporting me so this could happen.

118
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:10,845
Thank you so, so much staff-san for all your hard work.

119
00:14:11,545 --> 00:14:16,045
I'm so happy and I'm so nervous, can you tell?

120
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:19,545
So, did you guys enjoy the first two songs?

121
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:22,545
Wonderland and delete.

122
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:26,545
Wonderland is milet-san's song.

123
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:29,545
It's not Ina's live without a milet song.

124
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:34,545
I don't think it's as well known, but it's definitely one of my favorite songs by her,

125
00:14:34,845 --> 00:14:37,045
so I wanted to perform it for you guys someday.

126
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:41,245
And delete, it's actually an insert song in the

127
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:44,045
Sword Art Online movie, Ordinal Scale.

128
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:48,545
And I really liked the song in the movie and I, you know, I wanted to perform it for you guys.

129
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:53,045
Coincidentally too, they're both composed by Yuki Kajiura-san,

130
00:14:53,545 --> 00:14:56,545
which I'm a really big fan of because she has

131
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:59,545
a magical sense for creating these mysterious...

132
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:02,157
...yet mythical, mythical songs.

133
00:15:03,257 --> 00:15:05,157
Yeah!

134
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:08,457
And as you can see, we're kind of in a monochrome world.

135
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,457
You'd be like, "Hey, did they forget to add in the colors

136
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:14,357
to this place? What's happening?"

137
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:17,657
But you know, I... it's intended.

138
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:20,557
I've always said before that before I joined Hololive and all,

139
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:24,757
the world kind of looked bland and monochrome.

140
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,957
But as time went on here, where I met all wonderful members,

141
00:15:28,957 --> 00:15:32,457
wonderful staff, and it became a lot more colorful.

142
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:36,557
So I wanted to kind of add that into this special live.

143
00:15:36,757 --> 00:15:38,957
My first birthday live!

144
00:15:39,957 --> 00:15:43,757
So yeah, maybe you know, if we go down this live,

145
00:15:43,757 --> 00:15:47,357
we'll find some color again?

146
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:52,557
And of course, I've got to mention the title of the live:

147
00:15:52,557 --> 00:15:54,657
Neverland Paradox.

148
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:58,557
It sounds very difficult, but if you break it down,

149
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:02,457
Neverland is kind of this imaginary, ideal world

150
00:16:02,457 --> 00:16:04,757
that's not supposed to exist.

151
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:08,157
But if it doesn't exist, why do we know about it?

152
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:10,257
Why? How? It's a paradox.

153
00:16:10,657 --> 00:16:13,357
So, you know, kind of like that.

154
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:17,357
Let's pretend that this world here, right here, is Neverland,

155
00:16:17,357 --> 00:16:21,057
and we'll go down this journey together.

156
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:23,057
Yeah, together!

157
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:27,657
Anyways, if you want to talk about this live somewhere,

00:16:27,657 --> 00:16:31,057
let me see the comments later too, #INAinaNeverland.

159
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,057
#INAinaNeverland. Is it here? Is it here? Is it here? Somewhere?

160
00:16:35,457 --> 00:16:39,557
So tweet about it! Tell your friends! It's happening!

161
00:16:39,557 --> 00:16:41,857
Ina's first birthday live! Yay!

162
00:16:45,357 --> 00:16:48,357
Anyways, I hope you'll have a lot of fun during the live.

163
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:52,557
Let's enjoy our trip through Neverland together.

164
00:16:52,557 --> 00:16:54,057
Never-ever-land.

165
00:16:54,257 --> 00:16:56,057
Never-ever-neverland.

166
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:59,257
Never-ever-never-ever-ever-neverland.

167
00:16:59,557 --> 00:17:01,057
Yeah! Let's go!

169
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:34,157
一人じゃできないこと　探してみたよ
I searched for things that couldn't be done alone.

170
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:39,257
二人じゃなきゃできない何かを
Something that can only be done by two.

171
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:44,257
でもその答えを探せば探すほど
But the more I search for that answer,

172
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:50,857
誰かと笑ってる僕を殺したくなる
The more I want to kill the "me"
who's laughing with someone.

173
00:17:54,057 --> 00:18:00,057
1 + 1 が一番美しいよ
1 + 1 is the most beautiful.

174
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:08,557
僕はそう思いたくて誰かに縛られてる
I wanted to believe that, and I'm bound by someone.

175
00:18:08,707 --> 00:18:13,657
解きたくてそんな自分が一番美しいと思った
Wanting to break free,
I thought that version of myself was the most beautiful.

176
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:33,457
二人でできないこと　たくさんある
There are many things that can't be done by two.

177
00:18:33,607 --> 00:18:38,557
一人でできることが　多すぎて
There are too many things that can be done alone.

178
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:43,657
だから僕がもっと大量に必要だよ
That's why I need much more of "me".

179
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:53,057
そして誰かに僕の役を押し付けた
And then I thrust my role upon someone else.

180
00:18:54,057 --> 00:19:00,057
僕の声は　一言も　輪になれない
My voice can't join the circle by even a word.

181
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:05,157
なれないんだから
Because it just can't.

182
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:12,557
ここで誰かが演じる僕を見てるよ
Here, I'm watching someone perform as me.

183
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:22,557
僕はそう思いたくて誰かが演じる僕が
I wanted to believe that,
because the me performed by someone else

184
00:19:22,707 --> 00:19:29,057
僕のそれより美しくて輝いているから
Is more beautiful and radiant than the real me.

185
00:19:29,257 --> 00:19:35,057
僕によく似たあなたに僕をプレゼントするよ
I'll present myself to you, who looks just like me.

186
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:41,057
要らなくなったらそっとゴミに包んで捨てて
If you don't need me anymore,
just wrap me in trash and throw me away.

187
00:19:47,607 --> 00:19:53,657
要らなくなったらゴミに包んで捨てれるよ
If you don't need me anymore,
you can just wrap me in trash and throw me away.

震えてるわ
You're trembling

234
00:25:31,331 --> 00:25:35,881
澄みきった瞳
With clear eyes

235
00:25:37,031 --> 00:25:41,581
レンガの病棟で
In the brick hospital ward

236
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:46,881
うまく歌えなくて
Unable to sing well

237
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:52,581
霧が煙る夜
On a foggy night

238
00:25:53,681 --> 00:25:58,281
浮かべ合った月
The moon we floated together

239
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:03,281
ほら見て私を
Look at me

240
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:07,581
目を逸らさないで
Don't look away

241
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:12,861
黒い鉄格子のなかで
Inside the black iron bars

242
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:15,531
私は生まれてきたんだ
I was born

243
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:18,231
悪意の代償を願う
Wishing for the price of malice

244
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:20,981
がままにお前に
As it is, for you

245
00:26:21,031 --> 00:26:23,531
さあ喰らえ正義を
Now, consume justice

246
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:26,331
壊して　壊される前に
Destroy it, before you are destroyed

247
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:28,831
因果の代償を払い
Paying the price of karma

248
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:36,581
共にゆこう　名前のない怪物
Let's go together, nameless monster

249
00:26:47,031 --> 00:26:51,581
耳鳴りがしてる
My ears are ringing

250
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:57,081
突如もう五月蝿くて
Suddenly, it's so loud

251
00:26:58,031 --> 00:27:02,581
思い出せないの
I can't remember

252
00:27:03,531 --> 00:27:07,581
あの日の旋律
That day's melody

253
00:27:08,531 --> 00:27:13,081
雨はまだ止まない
The rain still won't stop

254
00:27:14,031 --> 00:27:18,581
何も見えないの
I can't see anything

255
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:23,581
ほら見てこんなに
Look, I've...

256
00:27:24,031 --> 00:27:29,081
大きくなったの
...grown this much

257
00:27:30,531 --> 00:27:33,031
黒い雨降らすこの空
This sky that rains black rain

258
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:35,831
私は望まれないもの
I am something unwanted

259
00:27:35,831 --> 00:27:38,231
ひび割れたノイローゼ
A cracked neurosis

260
00:27:38,231 --> 00:27:41,031
愛した傍観者たちに
To the bystanders I loved

261
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:43,531
さあ今奮え正義を
Now, stir up justice

262
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:46,331
消せない傷跡抱きしめて
Embracing the indelible scars

263
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,831
この身体受け入れ共にゆこう
Accepting this body, let's go together

シャル・ウィ・ダンス？
Shall We Dance?

生きてるマリオネット
A living marionette

285
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:45,459
支援者がスイングしたら
When the supporters swing

286
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:49,126
さあ、お祝いはいかが
Now, how about a celebration?

287
00:30:50,093 --> 00:30:53,126
Odd-to-too, odd-to-too, odd-to-too...

288
00:30:53,426 --> 00:30:56,659
私上手く踊れないわ
I can't dance very well

289
00:30:56,793 --> 00:31:00,159
痛みも憂いも悲しみは
Pain, grief, and sadness

290
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:03,659
混ぜて、止めて
Mix them, stop them

291
00:31:03,826 --> 00:31:06,693
おやすみのキス
A goodnight kiss

292
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:11,326
Shall we dance? 踊りましょう
Shall we dance? Let's dance

293
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:15,226
絶望、欲望 This is the life
Despair, desire, this is the life

294
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:19,126
Shadow line 余計なこと
Shadow line, unnecessary things

295
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:23,093
考えないで一つになりましょう
Don't think about them, let's become one

296
00:31:23,326 --> 00:31:26,793
いいな、いいな
How nice, how nice

297
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:31,226
人間って、人間って
To be human, to be human

298
00:31:31,426 --> 00:31:34,759
いいな
It's nice

299
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:48,493
泣きたいのに笑っちゃう
Even though I want to cry, I laugh

300
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:52,493
人生って、見える
Life is visible

301
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:56,626
本当の心隠して
Hiding my true heart

302
00:31:56,826 --> 00:32:00,659
笑うフリ忘れるの
Forgetting how to pretend to laugh

303
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:04,659
Odd-to-too, odd-to-too, odd-to-too...

304

I can't live very well

305
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:11,226
本音も嘘も不安も
True feelings, lies, and anxiety

306
00:32:11,426 --> 00:32:14,726
溶かして、蓋して
Melt them, cover them

307
00:32:14,926 --> 00:32:17,726
おやすみなさい
Good night

308
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:22,659
Shall we dream? 夢見ましょう
Shall we dream? Let's dream

309
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:26,659
泣き出し、目覚めて This is the life
Bursting into tears, waking up, this is the life

310
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:30,526
Shadow line 目を閉じて
Shadow line, close your eyes

311
00:32:30,726 --> 00:32:34,659
嫌なこと全部全部忘れましょう
Let's forget all the bad things

312
00:32:35,193 --> 00:32:38,726
Shall we dance? 不器用でも
Shall we dance? Even if we're clumsy

313
00:32:38,926 --> 00:32:42,659
間違えてもいいよ This is the life
It's okay to make mistakes, this is the life

314
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:46,659
Shadow step 余計なこと
Shadow step, unnecessary things

315
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:51,193
考えないでステップを踏み出せ
Don't think about them, take a step forward

316
00:33:30,493 --> 00:33:34,126
Shall we smile? 今だけは
Shall we smile? Just for now

317
00:33:34,326 --> 00:33:38,159
一緒に笑ってみませんか？
Won't you try laughing with me?

318
00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:42,493
Shadow dance 今だけは
Shadow dance, just for now

319
00:33:42,693 --> 00:33:46,626
全部忘れて一緒に飛びましょう
Forget everything and let's jump together

320
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:50,693
Shall we dance? 踊りましょう
Shall we dance? Let's dance

321
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:54,726
絶望、欲望 This is the life
Despair, desire, this is the life

322
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,693
Shadow line 余計なこと
Shadow line, unnecessary things

323
00:33:58,893 --> 00:34:02,659
考えないで一つになりましょう
Don't think about them, let's become one

324
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:06,226
いいな、いいな
How nice, how nice

325
00:34:07,126 --> 00:34:10,693
人間って、いいな
To be human is nice

326
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:15,193
いいな、いいな
How nice, how nice

327
00:34:16,126 --> 00:34:19,726
人間って、人間って
To be human, to be human

328
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,126
いいな
It's nice

329
00:34:55,093 --> 00:35:00,093

Lyrics: LUMINA Composition: seibin

331
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:30,305
運ばれてる夜の　目に映った星
Stars reflected in the eyes of the night being carried along

332
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:35,805
ひな向月が　味を擽る
The fledgling moon tickles the taste

333
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:40,905
流れる光に　沿って歩いてみたら
If I try walking along the flowing light

334
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:46,405
耳に囁いた　君に届くかな
I wonder if my whisper will reach you

335
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:49,105
今手を繋いでも
Even if we hold hands now

336
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:51,805
精一杯抱きしめても
Even if I hug you with all my might

337
00:36:51,905 --> 00:36:56,605
空は秋に満ちるんだ
The sky will be filled with autumn

338
00:36:57,205 --> 00:37:00,405
指先でゆらゆらと
Swaying with my fingertips

339
00:37:00,505 --> 00:37:03,105
その五線譜が
That musical staff

340
00:37:03,205 --> 00:37:07,905
止まった時計の　針に踏み込んだ
Stepped onto the hands of the stopped clock

341
00:37:08,305 --> 00:37:12,805
たった待った願いさえ
Even the wish I just waited for

342
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:15,305
離れた今は
Now that it's far away

343
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:18,905
その笑顔を　知ってるよ
I know that smile

344
00:37:29,405 --> 00:37:34,305
瞬歌う夜の　目に映った空
The sky reflected in the eyes of the night singing light

345
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:39,605
爽やかな香り　鼻を擽る
A refreshing scent tickles my nose

346
00:37:40,105 --> 00:37:44,905
足跡を合わせて　歩いてみたら
If I try walking matching my footsteps

347
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:50,305
私を見ていた　君に届くかな
I wonder if it will reach you who was looking at me

348
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:52,905
ずっと手を繋いでも
Even if we hold hands forever

349
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:55,805
瞳をみつめてみても
Even if I gaze into your eyes

350
00:37:55,905 --> 00:38:00,705
空は雨に染まるんだ
The sky will be dyed in rain

351
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:04,305
君を呼び出した声
The voice that called out to you

352
00:38:04,405 --> 00:38:07,305
の形が
The shape of...

353
00:38:07,405 --> 00:38:12,105
渇いた笑顔を　濡らして
Drenching the parched smile

354
00:38:12,305 --> 00:38:16,905
強く叫んだ声が
The voice that shouted strongly

355
00:38:17,105 --> 00:38:19,605
重なった今は
Now that they've overlapped

356
00:38:19,705 --> 00:38:22,905
その言葉を　知ってるよ
I know those words

357
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:35,805
君は分かってるかな
I wonder if you understand

358
00:38:35,905 --> 00:38:38,605
教えてくれた
You taught me

359
00:38:38,705 --> 00:38:41,305
戻らない
Not returning

360
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:45,905
その幸せは
That happiness is...

361
00:38:57,405 --> 00:39:02,405
運ばれてる夜の　目に映った星
Stars reflected in the eyes of the night being carried along

362
00:39:02,605 --> 00:39:07,605
光った月が　消えてゆく
The shining moon fades away

363
00:39:08,105 --> 00:39:11,305
指先でゆらゆらと
Swaying with my fingertips

364
00:39:11,405 --> 00:39:14,305
その動きが
That movement...

365
00:39:14,405 --> 00:39:18,905
止まった時計の　針に踏み込んだ
Stepped onto the hands of the stopped clock

366
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:23,605
雲が描いた列車
The train drawn by the clouds

367
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:25,605
強く噛み
Biting strongly...

368
00:39:25,805 --> 00:39:29,105
その笑顔を　知ってるよ
I know that smile

369
00:39:35,905 --> 00:39:38,905
Hi, welcome back!

370
00:39:40,905 --> 00:39:44,305
Ah, that was quite a lot of songs.

371
00:39:44,905 --> 00:39:47,405
And look! We got some color back.

372
00:39:48,405 --> 00:39:51,605
What color is this? Violet?

373
00:39:52,405 --> 00:39:54,405
Well, I hope you guys enjoyed the songs.

374
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:56,605
We sang a couple of songs.

375
00:39:56,905 --> 00:40:00,105
First one being "DUMMY DUMMY" by DECO*27.

376
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:01,017
皆さん、
Everyone,

377
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:04,717
It's a song I've been fond of for quite a long time actually.

378
00:40:05,517 --> 00:40:10,617
It's, uh... I think it's lesser known than some of his really, you know, famous songs...

379
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,617
...but it has a special place in my heart.

380
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:16,517
So I really wanted to sing it for you guys.

381
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,517
And I hope you guys enjoyed it.

382
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:24,517
The song I sang after that is called "こちら、幸福安心委員会です。"
The song I sang after that is called "This is the Happiness and Peace of Mind Committee."

383
00:40:24,917 --> 00:40:29,717
I think it's a really fun song that's perfect for a cult.

384
00:40:30,317 --> 00:40:33,317
Although I wouldn't know anything about being a cult.

385
00:40:33,317 --> 00:40:35,517
Definitely not a cult, by the way.

386
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:40,517
幸せですか？ 義務ですよ！
Are you happy? It's a duty!

387
00:40:41,317 --> 00:40:46,517
Yeah, and the song after that was "名前のない怪物".
Yeah, and the song after that was "The Nameless Monster."

388
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:50,117
If you guys know, I really love EGOIST...

389
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:52,517
...and one of my favorite songs by them is actually this song.

390
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:57,517
I've sung it, I think, once or twice in karaoke before...

391
00:40:57,917 --> 00:41:02,917
...but I really wanted to sing it in a live as well, so I hope you guys enjoyed it.

392
00:41:04,317 --> 00:41:08,317
The song after that was called "Shall We Dance" by ReoNa.

393
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:13,317
A song that you guys actually, a lot of you asked me to sing it after "Nai Nai"...

394
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:18,317
...because it's also from the same series, anime series "Shadow House".

395
00:41:19,517 --> 00:41:24,517
But since, you know, the title itself is "Shall We Dance" and it's a very danceable song...

396
00:41:24,517 --> 00:41:31,117
...I thought I might as well save it for the live, which I hope you guys enjoyed.

397
00:41:32,517 --> 00:41:36,317
I think the choreo was a little difficult for me to learn...

398
00:41:36,517 --> 00:41:41,517
...but I think I pulled it off. Did I, did I do okay?

399
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:47,717
Yes, and the song after that is "Violet", my first original song.

400
00:41:48,517 --> 00:41:52,317
It's very nostalgic to me every time I listen to it.

401
00:41:52,517 --> 00:41:56,317
And I guess it's been quite a while since I first released it.

402
00:41:56,517 --> 00:41:59,917
As it was my first original song, I learned a lot from it...

403
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:04,317
...and so it's really special to me.

404
00:42:04,717 --> 00:42:10,117
But as I've said before, it's been a while since the first original.

405
00:42:10,717 --> 00:42:14,717
So maybe it's time for a second one? Sometime soon.

406
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:18,317
Soon? Soon.

407
00:42:19,617 --> 00:42:23,317
But anyways, thank you everyone for always supporting me.

408
00:42:23,717 --> 00:42:26,917
Thanks everyone who helped in making this live happen.

409
00:42:27,517 --> 00:42:32,517
Without you guys, staff-san, everyone, this wouldn't have happened.

410
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,717
So thank you very, very much.

411
00:42:35,617 --> 00:42:38,917
Yeah, I guess we'll move on to the next song.

412
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:41,517
I hope you'll enjoy it.

413

Meconopsis
Lyrics: WUNDER RIKU Composition・Arrangement: M2U

414
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:13,917
Sapphire petals fall through infinite white sea

415
00:43:14,317 --> 00:43:19,517
Misty whispers call, drowning in endless dreams

416
00:43:20,117 --> 00:43:25,117
Is this my sanity, clinging for my memory?

417
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:31,117
Is this humanity, or long forgotten land?

418
00:43:31,517 --> 00:43:36,917
壇上の野草が最後のはなびらを落とす
Wild grass on the stage drops its final petal

419
00:43:37,317 --> 00:43:42,117
心はあなたの嘘をすべて暴く
My heart exposes all of your lies

420
00:43:42,617 --> 00:43:47,717
Enough! No, I will keep playing endlessly

421
00:43:48,117 --> 00:43:53,317
A world without love is not the world that I want to see

422
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:59,317
If such a man withers, I'll oh yes see

423
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:05,117
Tell me how do I reconcile the joy in my memory

424
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:10,917
今だ身を落とす最後のチャンス
Now is the last chance to throw myself down

425
00:44:11,317 --> 00:44:16,317
血の誓い 藍の誓い
A blood oath, an indigo oath

426
00:44:16,617 --> 00:44:22,117
Together we may die, love is now and forever

427
00:44:28,117 --> 00:44:33,117
孤独に割れぬ愛を...
A love that cannot be broken in solitude...

428
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:38,717
When the silver diamond oceans alight, eternity sapphire petals fall through

429
00:44:39,117 --> 00:44:44,517
壇上の野草が最後のはなびらを落とす
Wild grass on the stage drops its final petal

430
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:49,917
心はあなたの嘘をすべて暴く
My heart exposes all of your lies

431
00:44:50,317 --> 00:44:55,317
Enough! No, I will keep playing endlessly

432
00:44:55,717 --> 00:45:00,117
A world without love is not the world that I want to see

433
00:45:00,129 --> 00:45:01,929
a world that I want to see

434
00:45:01,929 --> 00:45:04,229
If sentiment fritters

435
00:45:04,229 --> 00:45:06,629
our way to see

436
00:45:06,629 --> 00:45:09,329
Tell me how

437
00:45:09,329 --> 00:45:11,129
do I reconcile

438
00:45:11,129 --> 00:45:13,329
the tour in my memory

439
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:18,129
今がみんなを映し出す最後の一手
Now is the final move that projects everyone

440
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:32,529
And dreams fell off

441
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:36,129
in the arms of love

442
00:45:36,129 --> 00:45:37,729
Enough!

443
00:45:37,729 --> 00:45:41,229
In love!

444
00:45:41,229 --> 00:45:43,229
In love!

445
00:45:43,229 --> 00:45:46,629
Though I will keep praying endlessly

446
00:45:46,629 --> 00:45:48,929
A world without love is not the world

447
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:52,629
that I want to see

448
00:45:52,629 --> 00:45:55,329
If sentiment fritters

449
00:45:55,329 --> 00:45:57,729
our way to see

450
00:45:57,729 --> 00:46:00,529
Tell me how

451
00:46:00,529 --> 00:46:02,429
do I reconcile

452
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:04,529
the tour in my memory

453
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:09,429
今がみんなを映し出す最後の一手
Now is the final move that projects everyone

454
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:12,429
血の誓い

455
00:46:12,429 --> 00:46:14,429
愛の誓い
Oath of love

456
00:46:14,429 --> 00:46:16,229
Till death may die

457
00:46:16,229 --> 00:46:21,129
Love is now and for forever

458
00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:40,529
ああ、いつものように
Ah, just like always

459
00:46:40,529 --> 00:46:43,729
過ぎる日々に欠伸が出る
I yawn at the passing days

460
00:46:43,729 --> 00:46:47,429
さんざめく夜、越え、
Crossing the bustling night,

461
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:51,629
渋谷の街に朝が降る
Morning falls upon the city of Shibuya

462
00:46:51,629 --> 00:46:54,929
どこか虚しいような
A feeling like something is empty,

463
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:57,129
そんな気持ち
Such a feeling

464
00:46:57,129 --> 00:47:00,129
つまらないな、でもそれでいい
It's boring, but that's okay

465
00:47:00,129 --> 00:47:03,429
そんなもんさ、これでいい
That's just how it is, this is fine

466
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:07,229
知らず知らず隠してた
The true voice I've been hiding unconsciously

467
00:47:07,229 --> 00:47:10,129
本当の声を響かせてよ、ほら
Let it ring out, look

468
00:47:10,129 --> 00:47:12,929
見ないフリしていても
Even if I pretend not to see

469
00:47:12,929 --> 00:47:17,129
確かにそこに、ある
It's definitely right there

470
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:19,929
ああ、感じたままに描く
Ah, I paint it as I feel it

471
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:24,129
自分で選んだその色で
With the colors that I chose myself

472
00:47:24,129 --> 00:47:27,529
眠い空気纏う朝に
In the morning wrapped in sleepy air

473
00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:31,129
訪れた青い世界
A blue world has arrived

474
00:47:31,129 --> 00:47:34,629
好きなものを好きだと言う
Saying I like the things I like

475
00:47:34,629 --> 00:47:38,129
怖くて仕方ないけれど
I'm so scared I can't help it, but

476
00:47:38,129 --> 00:47:42,129
本当の自分に出会えた気がしたんだ
I felt like I was able to meet my true self

477
00:47:53,129 --> 00:47:56,929
ああ、手を伸ばせば伸ばすほどに
Ah, the more I reach out my hand

478
00:47:56,929 --> 00:47:59,329
遠くへゆく
The further away it goes

479
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:02,929
思うようにいかない今日も
Even today, when things don't go as planned

480
00:48:02,929 --> 00:48:06,929
また慌ただしくもがいてる
I'm struggling hectically again

481
00:48:06,929 --> 00:48:11,829
悔しい気持ちもただ情けなくて
Even the frustrating feelings are just miserable

482
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:13,529
涙が出る
And the tears fall

483
00:48:13,529 --> 00:48:16,929
踏み込むほど苦しくなる
The further I step in, the more painful it becomes

484
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:20,329
痛くもなる
It starts to hurt too

485
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:23,829
ああ、感じたままに進む
Ah, I move forward as I feel it

486
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:27,829
自分で選んだこの道を
Along this path that I chose myself

487
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:31,629
重いまぶた擦る夜に
In the night when I rub my heavy eyelids

488
00:48:31,629 --> 00:48:35,429
しがみついた青い誓い
I clung to the blue oath

489
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:38,329
好きなことを続けること
Continuing to do what I love

490
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:41,929
それは「楽しい」だけじゃない
It's not just about 'having fun'

491
00:48:41,929 --> 00:48:45,929
本当にできる？不安になるけど
Can I really do it? I get anxious, but

492
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:48,929
何回でも、ほら何回でも
As many times as it takes, look, as many times as it takes

493
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:52,929
自信がないから描いてきたんだよ
I've been painting because I lack confidence

494
00:48:53,729 --> 00:48:56,529
何回でも、ほら何回でも
As many times as it takes, look, as many times as it takes

495
00:48:56,529 --> 00:48:59,929
積み上げてきたことが武器になる
What I've built up will become my weapon

496
00:49:00,129 --> 00:49:03,329
周りを見たって、誰かと比べたって
Even if I look around, even if I compare myself to others

497
00:49:03,329 --> 00:49:07,529
僕にしかできないことはなんだ
What is the one thing only I can do?

498
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:12,729
今でも自信なんかない、それでも
I still don't have any confidence, but even so

499
00:49:12,729 --> 00:49:15,929
感じたことない気持ち
A feeling I've never felt before

500
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:19,029
知らずにいた想い
Thoughts I never knew I had

501
00:49:19,029 --> 00:49:27,129
あの日踏み出して、初めて感じたこの痛みも全部
Stepping out that day, all this pain I felt for the first time too

502
00:49:27,129 --> 00:49:30,929
好きなものと向き合うことで
By facing the things I love

503
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:33,929
触れたまだ小さな光
I touched a light that is still small

504
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:38,129
大丈夫、行こう、あとは楽しむだけだ
It's okay, let's go, the rest is just to enjoy it

505
00:49:40,929 --> 00:49:43,729
ああ、全てを掛けて描く
Ah, I paint with everything I've got

506
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:47,929
自分にしか出せない色で
With colors that only I can produce

507
00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:51,429
朝も夜も走り続け
Running through both morning and night

508
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:55,329
見つけ出した青い光
The blue light that I found

509
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:59,129
好きなものと向き合うこと
Facing the things I love

510
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:01,541
良いことだけを
Only the good things

511
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,341
思い回る
revolve in my mind

512
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:06,641
あの日の透明な僕じゃない
I'm not the transparent me of that day

513
00:50:08,641 --> 00:50:10,141
ありのままの
Just as I am

514
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:13,141
かけがえの無い僕だ
I'm the irreplaceable me

515
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:15,641
知らず知らず隠してた
Unknowingly hidden

516
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:20,141
本当の声を響かせてよ、ほら
let your true voice ring out, look

517
00:50:20,141 --> 00:50:22,441
見ないふりしていても
Even if you're pretending not to see

518
00:50:22,441 --> 00:50:27,641
確かにそこに今もそこにあるよ
It's certainly there, even now it's there

519
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:30,141
知らず知らず隠してた
Unknowingly hidden

520
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:34,441
本当の声を響かせてよ、さあ
let your true voice ring out, come on

521
00:50:34,441 --> 00:50:36,641
見ないふりしていても
Even if you're pretending not to see

522
00:50:36,641 --> 00:50:41,141
確かにそこに君の中に
It's certainly there, within you

523
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:11,541
Come back Takodachi, come here.

524
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:13,641
Sit, sit.

525
00:51:15,641 --> 00:51:18,341
How was the live? Did you enjoy it?

526
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,641
How was it? Fun?

527
00:51:21,941 --> 00:51:24,141
I'm glad, I'm glad.

528
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:26,641
Thanks always for your support.

529
00:51:26,641 --> 00:51:30,141
Without you, this wouldn't have happened.

530
00:51:30,141 --> 00:51:33,641
Wow, it's been a long three years, huh?

531
00:51:34,141 --> 00:51:38,341
Well, let's continue to have more fun
from now on too, okay?

532
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:39,341
Yeah?

533
00:51:39,341 --> 00:51:43,141
Forever, ever, ever, ever, ever.

534
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:20,141
Thanks for watching!!
It took a while, but we did it!!!

535
00:52:20,141 --> 00:52:25,141
Thank you, always, for your support.
And for your patience in waiting for this live!!

536
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:30,141
I hope you enjoyed it!!! Thank you also to all
the staff and everyone who helped make this happen!

537
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:35,141
I'll keep doing my best!! WAH!!!!
