00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,800
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Ina'nis.

3
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,800
She spent her days singing by the lake.

4
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,600
But one day,

5
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,800
She woke up somewhere else.

6
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,350
透き通る　季節が好き
I love the clear seasons

7
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,900
風がまた　熱を連れてくる
The wind brings back the heat once more

8
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:26,550
何千回も巡って　何万回も輝く
Orbiting thousands of times, shining tens of thousands of times

9
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,050
そうやって　光が生まれる
That's how light is born

12
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,250
陽射しが溶けてる　空の向こう
The sunlight is melting beyond the sky

13
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:55,350
どこまでも　透明な青
A transparent blue that goes on forever

14
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,600
スピードを上げた
I picked up the speed

15
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:05,008
イノセント・ブルー ～ version de l'apprivoiser
Innocent Blue ~ version de l'apprivoiser

16
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,808
思い立ち
Having made up my mind

17
00:05:01,808 --> 00:05:04,208
自分の意志で
By my own will

18
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,508
今　飛び立つの
I'm taking flight now

19
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,308
感じている
I can feel it

20
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,408
無邪気な誓い
An innocent vow

21
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:18,508
言葉は知らない
I don't know the words

22
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:23,008
流れていく
Flowing away

23
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:27,408
水の行方に
To where the water goes

24
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:30,408
心を馳せよ
Let your heart wander

25
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:35,308
透き通る季節が過ぎ
The transparent season passes

26
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:42,508
風が待つ熱を連れてくる
Bringing the heat the wind awaits

27
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:48,208
傷跡は消えていったわ
The scars have faded away

28
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:54,608
溢れ出す情熱のシンフォニー
An overflowing symphony of passion

29
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,408

Going around thousands of times

おとぎの深い霧
The deep mist of a fairy tale

37
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:25,708
差しのべた手のひら
An outstretched palm

38
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:30,808
そっと触れる予感
A premonition of a gentle touch

39
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:36,008
受け止めて零れた
Caught and spilled over

40
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:40,408
光の一滴
A single drop of light

41
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:49,008
La la la...

42
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:54,508
面影うつろって
Traces fading away

43
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:59,608
追憶はまぼろし
Recollections are but an illusion

44
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:05,408
想いの果てる場所
The place where feelings end

45
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:10,708
まだ遥か遠くて
Is still far, far away

46
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:16,608
求め探して彷徨って
Seeking, searching, and wandering

47
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:21,808
やがて謳われて幾千幾万幾億の
Eventually sung by thousands, millions, billions

48
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:26,608
旋律となる
It becomes a melody

49
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:32,408
いつか失い奪われて
Some day lost and snatched away

50

消える定めでもそれは忘れられることなき物語
Even if destined to vanish, it is a story that will never be forgotten

51
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:48,508
指先を絡めて
Entwining fingertips

52
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:53,908
触れる誰かの夢
Touching someone's dream

53
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:59,108

追いつかない　この身一つじゃ足りない叫び
a scream that isn't enough with just this one body.

79

君の手に触れた時にだけ震えた心があったよ
There was a heart that only trembled when it touched your hand.

I can't talk.

99

Are we all miraculously present?

100

share it with everyone

112
00:16:03,024 --> 00:16:04,524

Yeah!

115

So that I can also, you know, read what you guys

116
00:16:12,524 --> 00:16:16,524
have thought about while watching the stream and stuff.

117

Where are we?

120
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:23,524
Where are we?

121
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,824
I just went through a door

122
00:16:25,824 --> 00:16:28,024
and suddenly we ended up in this...

123
00:16:28,024 --> 00:16:31,024
I don't know, it almost looks like we're inside

124
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,524
a storybook or something.

125
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,524
I have no idea where we are.

126
00:16:34,524 --> 00:16:36,224
But you know what?

127
00:16:36,224 --> 00:16:38,224
We're gonna roll with it,

128
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:39,524
'cause that's what we do.

129
00:16:39,524 --> 00:16:40,824
And of course,

130
00:16:40,824 --> 00:16:43,024
let us not forget...

131
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:45,024
my clothes also changed!

132
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:48,524
Look! Do I look cute?

133
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:50,024
Wow!

134
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:52,524
And of course, you know, look at all the details!

135
00:16:52,524 --> 00:16:55,024
My flaps have gone longer.

136
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:57,024
I have this cool gauntlet now.

137
00:16:57,024 --> 00:16:58,524
Look at this!

138
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:00,024
Wah, I feel like a knight.

139
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:03,524
I feel like I can defeat all evil.

140
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,524
And of course I got my, I don't know,

141
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,524
three glass pens behind me.

142
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:11,024
Wow! I wonder if this is my weapon.

143
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:14,024
I can poke people with my glass pens.

144
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:17,024
And all the details on the dress!

145
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:19,524
Isn't it beautiful?

146
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:22,524
And look, my skirt is actually made out of

147
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:24,024
Takodachis!

148
00:17:24,024 --> 00:17:26,524
Ooh! That's right.

149
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:29,024
I know, so I can already see it,

150
00:17:29,024 --> 00:17:30,824
you know, you guys are going,

151
00:17:30,824 --> 00:17:33,024
"Oh, Ina, that's me, that's me!"

152
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:36,024
But yeah, look at this beautiful, beautiful outfit.

153
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:38,024
Of course, I gotta thank Kuroboshi-papa

154
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:41,024
for designing this wonderful, wonderful outfit.

155
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:43,024
Thank you, Kuroboshi-papa!

So, yeah!

158
00:17:48,524 --> 00:17:51,524
And you know, I want to talk about a lot of things,

159
00:17:51,524 --> 00:17:53,024
but it is my birthday,

160
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:55,824
and I'm gonna go have fun around here.

161
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,024
I don't know where we are,

162
00:17:58,024 --> 00:18:00,824
but you know, I'm gonna go look around

163
00:18:00,824 --> 00:18:02,024
and see where we end up.

164
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:03,524
We'll see, I don't know.

165
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:05,524
Maybe we'll find something fun to do.

166
00:18:05,524 --> 00:18:07,524
But yeah, you know,

167
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:09,524
I guess I'll see you guys around.

168
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:10,524
Take care!

169
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:11,224
Oh, what is this place?

170
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:12,524
I don't know. Do they have food around here? Hmm.

171
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,824
こ、え、え、こ…
Co, eh, eh, co...

172
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:51,124
あ、アキ先輩じゃないですか！
Oh, isn't it Aki-senpai!

173
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:52,524
お、イナ！
Oh, Ina!

174
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:54,224
アキ、イナ…
Aki, Ina...

175
00:18:54,224 --> 00:18:57,524
え、なんで石になってたんですか？
Eh, why was I turned into stone?

176
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:00,224
ここ、おん、あれ？
Here, um, that?

177
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:03,024
なんか影があったような気がして、
I felt like there was a shadow,

178
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:06,024
気づいたらこんな、待ってたんですけど…
and before I knew it, this... I was waiting, but...

179
00:19:06,524 --> 00:19:07,524
イナ！
Ina!

180
00:19:07,524 --> 00:19:08,024
はい！
Yes!

181
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,524
どこ、ここ？
Where is this?

182
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,524
私も知らないんです。
I don't know either.

183
00:19:12,524 --> 00:19:14,224
イナも知らないの！？
Ina doesn't know either!?

184
00:19:14,224 --> 00:19:15,024
はい。
Yes.

185
00:19:15,024 --> 00:19:18,024
なんか急に、なんかドアにヒュッとしたら、
Suddenly, I went through a door,

186
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,524
衣装もこれになったし、
and my outfit changed to this,

187
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:22,024
ここ、どこか知らない。
and I don't know where this is.

188
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:23,524
イナ、かわいい！
Ina, you're cute!

189
00:19:23,524 --> 00:19:24,524
新衣装、そうです。
New outfit, yes.

190
00:19:24,524 --> 00:19:26,524
可愛いでしょ！
It's cute, right!

191
00:19:27,224 --> 00:19:29,224
めっちゃ可愛い！
So cute!

192
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:31,224
よく見せて、よく見せて！
Show me well, show me well!

193
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:35,524
可愛い、可愛い！
Cute, cute!

194
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:39,524
いや、でも、ここ、なんか全然知らない場所で、
No, but, being in this place I don't know at all,

195
00:19:39,524 --> 00:19:42,524
アキ先輩がいて、なんか嬉しい！
and having Aki-senpai here, I'm kind of happy!

196
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:43,524
本当？そう。
Really? I see.

197
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,524
えー、アキロゼも、このね、3Dの姿で
Eh, AkiRose is also actually happy

198
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:51,524
イナとこうやって会えたの、実は嬉しい。
to be able to meet Ina like this in this 3D form.

199
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,024
嬉しい！
I'm happy!

200
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:55,224
実は私、あの、アキ先輩といつか、
Actually, I, um, wanted to

201
00:19:55,224 --> 00:20:00,024
あの、歌ったり、踊ったり、やりたかったんです。
um, sing and dance with Aki-senpai someday.

202
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:04,932
えっ、じゃあ、もしかして一緒に今日は歌えるの？
Wait, does that mean we can sing together today?

203
00:20:04,932 --> 00:20:06,132
いいんですか？
Is it okay?

204
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:07,732
いい、歌おうよ！
Yes, let's sing!

205
00:20:07,732 --> 00:20:09,132
やったー！嬉しい！
Yay! I'm so happy!

206
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:11,432
じゃあ、どの曲がいいかな？
Then, which song should we do?

207
00:20:11,432 --> 00:20:14,232
ふむふむ、ホロライブの曲もあるしね、色々。
Hmm, there are various Hololive songs too.

208
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:18,432
そうですね。でも、なんか、先輩の曲の中で一番、一番好きな曲は...
Right. But, my absolute favorite among your songs, Senpai...

209
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:23,232
やっぱり、あの曲ですね。
Is definitely that one.

210
00:20:23,232 --> 00:20:25,032
え？あれ？
Eh? That one?

211
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:27,432
あれですね。
That one.

212
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:30,132
えー？でもわかんないな。言ってくんないと。
Eh? But I don't know. You have to tell me.

213
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:33,232
あれですね、アキ先輩がこう、あ、あ、あ...
It's the one where Aki-senpai goes like, ah, ah, ah...

214
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,532
見れる、ちょっとセクシー、セクシーダンス。
Where we can see your slightly sexy dance.

215
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:38,932
セクシーダンスはいっぱいある？
There are lots of sexy dances?

216
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:40,832
あ、いっぱいじゃないか（笑）
Wait, maybe not that many (laughs).

217
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:46,332
でも、でも、なんかアキ先輩だったらこの曲ですね。
But, for Aki-senpai, it has to be this song.

218
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:49,632
じゃあ、今日は一緒にシャルイース、いいんですか？
Then, Shallrys together today? Is that okay?

219
00:20:49,632 --> 00:20:51,632
歌お、イナ。
Let's sing, Ina.

220
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:54,332
はい、よろしくお願いします！
Yes! I'm in your hands!

221
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:56,532
嬉しいー！
I'm so happy!

222
00:20:56,532 --> 00:21:00,332
シャルイース、イナとこうやって歌うのも初めてだもんね。
It's the first time singing Shallrys with you like this, Ina.

223
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:05,732
そうですね。なんかライブとかあんまり機会がなくて、うん。
True. There haven't been many chances at lives and such.

224
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:10,532
やっと、やっと、やっと！嬉しい、嬉しい！
Finally, finally, finally! So happy!

225
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:18,832
じゃあ、アキロゼのシャルイースはなんといってもアキロゼの国の伝承歌。
Well, Akirose's Shallrys is the traditional song of Akirose's country.

226
00:21:18,832 --> 00:21:23,732
だから、まあ何か、イナの助けになることがあるかもしれないし。
So, it might be able to help you in some way, Ina.

227
00:21:23,732 --> 00:21:29,832
一緒に歌ってパワーをね、つけてもらいたいなと思うから。
I want you to gain power by singing it together.

228
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:33,732
頑張ろう！
Let's do our best!

229
00:21:33,732 --> 00:21:36,832
はい、よろしくお願いします！
Yes! I'm in your hands!

230
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:39,432
ああ、ドキドキする！
Ah, my heart's racing!

231
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:41,332
はい、じゃあ行きましょうか。
Okay, shall we go?

こっちこっちこっちこっち...
This way, this way...

00:31:51,948 --> 00:31:57,348
きえ
Fading

319
00:31:57,848 --> 00:32:03,448
さいあくは
The worst

320
00:32:04,348 --> 00:32:09,448
まちおりる
Descends

321
00:32:10,048 --> 00:32:15,148
こわれたとき
When time breaks

322
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:20,848
ひとゆめ
A single dream

323
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:27,448
くりかえり
Repeats

324
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:33,348
わかれゆき
Departing

325
00:32:33,848 --> 00:32:39,698
ゆるされざる
Unforgiven

326
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:45,498
おとはな
Sound and flower

327
00:32:46,348 --> 00:32:51,198
しう
Falling death

328
00:34:03,548 --> 00:34:06,048
storia

329
00:34:03,548 --> 00:34:06,048
Lyrics, Music: 梶浦由記
Lyrics, Music: Yuki Kajiura

330
00:34:06,318 --> 00:34:12,468
秘密の黄昏に　君の手を取った
I took your hand in the secret twilight

331
00:34:13,108 --> 00:34:19,048
古のバラッド　繰り返すように
As if repeating an ancient ballad

332
00:34:19,428 --> 00:34:22,548
紡ぐ
We weave

333
00:34:22,998 --> 00:34:25,648
Romans of love

334
00:34:25,848 --> 00:34:31,468
君のことを　いつも歌いたい
I want to sing of you forever

335
00:34:31,908 --> 00:34:38,288
哀しい夜を　温もりで満たして
Filling the sad night with warmth

336
00:34:38,848 --> 00:34:45,348
愛を見つけて
Find love

337
00:34:45,968 --> 00:34:48,608
雛菊が咲いてた
Daisies were blooming

338
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:52,048
白い月輝いてた
The white moon was shining

339
00:34:52,328 --> 00:34:54,848
君の囁きで
With your whisper

340
00:34:55,028 --> 00:34:59,998
始まるよ　永久の
It begins, the eternal...

341
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:04,556
storia...

342
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:18,056
Voci di me a storia

343
00:35:30,856 --> 00:35:36,256
水のなか 静かに 澄んでゆく
In the water, it quietly becomes clear

344
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:43,656
懐かしい 恋の物語
A nostalgic tale of love

345
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:49,056
光と影の中から
From within the light and shadows

346
00:35:50,056 --> 00:35:55,256
愛しさは生まれて
Love is born

347
00:35:56,656 --> 00:36:01,856
帰る
And returns

348
00:36:03,256 --> 00:36:05,556
Kaji di mia solitu...

349
00:36:06,256 --> 00:36:09,256
君の目を見ていた
I was looking into your eyes

350
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,556
Ambe miya savitu...

351
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:16,056
その腕の中で
Within those arms

352
00:36:16,556 --> 00:36:19,556
恋人のささやき
The whispers of lovers

353
00:36:19,556 --> 00:36:22,556
星屑の散った
Scattered stardust

354
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:26,056
いにしえのバラード
An ancient ballad

355
00:36:26,056 --> 00:36:28,556
泉を満たして
Filling the spring

356
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:34,256
風は 西へ
The wind blows West

357
00:36:35,556 --> 00:36:41,556
優しい歌を君と歌いたい
I want to sing a gentle song with you

358
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:48,056
五月の月が今ここにある
The May moon is here now

359
00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:54,256
恋の歌が今宵響くから
For a love song echoes tonight

360
00:36:55,056 --> 00:37:01,056
冷たい胸を温もりで満たして
Filling the cold heart with warmth

361
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:04,856
語ろう
Let's tell...

362
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:11,856
愛の storia
The story of love

363
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:25,056
Ambe miya savitu...

364
00:37:44,256 --> 00:37:47,556
あれ？大丈夫？大丈夫ですか？
Huh? Are you okay? Are you alright?

365
00:37:48,756 --> 00:37:51,056
あれ？動ける！動ける！動けるぞ！
Huh? I can move! I can move! I can move!

366
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:53,356
やったー！やったー！
Yay! Yay!

367
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:56,256
動けるってなったね。いつも通り。よかったー。
We can move again. Back to normal. Thank goodness.

368
00:37:56,556 --> 00:37:58,256
いつものやつだ！
It's the usual thing!

369
00:37:58,556 --> 00:38:00,556
また動けるようになったぞ。
We can move again!

370
00:38:01,056 --> 00:38:04,556
いやー、助かった。イナちゃんが助けてくれたやつ？
Man, that was a lifesaver. Is this what Ina-chan saved us with?

371
00:38:04,856 --> 00:38:10,256
なんか、なんとかぴょんしたら動けるようになって。嬉しい。よかった。
Well, somehow after jumping around I could move again. I'm so happy. Thank goodness.

372
00:38:10,556 --> 00:38:12,856
やったー！やったー！動けたー！
Yay! Yay! We can move!

373
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:15,556
なんで石になってたんですか？
Why were you turned into stone?

374
00:38:16,056 --> 00:38:17,356
なんでだっけ？
Why was it again?

375
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:20,256
なんかね、なんか見たよね？
Well, we saw something, right?

376
00:38:20,556 --> 00:38:22,556
なんかいた。なんかいたんだよ。
Something was there. Something was definitely there.

377
00:38:22,856 --> 00:38:26,256
翼が... ふわーっとなってたから...
Wings... they were all fluttery...

378
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:28,256
竜っぽかったかな？
Was it like a dragon?

379
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,856
竜？ドラゴン？
A dragon? Dragon?

380
00:38:30,056 --> 00:38:33,856
竜っぽかったかな。竜っぽかった気はするけど...
I think it was dragon-like. It felt like a dragon, but...

381
00:38:34,056 --> 00:38:42,556
もうわかんなくなっちゃった。覚えてない。ごめんごめん。覚えてないけど...
I don't know anymore. I don't remember. Sorry, sorry. I don't remember, but...

382
00:38:43,056 --> 00:38:45,056
そういえば、イナちゃん！
By the way, Ina-chan!

383
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:45,856
はい！
Yes!

384
00:38:46,056 --> 00:38:48,256
あなた、誕生日じゃない！
It's your birthday, isn't it!

385
00:38:48,556 --> 00:38:50,256
そうです、誕生日です！
That's right, it's my birthday!

386
00:38:50,556 --> 00:38:54,556
おめでとうー！！
Happy Birthday!!

387
00:38:55,256 --> 00:38:58,856
いやー、大好きな二人と一緒って嬉しい。
I'm so happy to be with two people I love so much.

388
00:38:59,056 --> 00:39:03,556
照れるー！嬉しい！嬉しい！
That's embarrassing! We're happy too! So happy!

389
00:39:04,256 --> 00:39:08,256
なんかイナちゃんとね、五期生はね、言ったらデビュー日近かったもんね。
Well, Ina-chan and Gen 5, our debut dates were pretty close, weren't they?

390
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:11,856
そうですね。1ヶ月... 1ヶ月ぐらいだったから。
That's right. About a month... it was only about a month apart.

391
00:39:12,056 --> 00:39:14,856
なんかもう同期、同期。同期。
It's like we're batchmates, batchmates. Batchmates.

392
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:17,256
えへへ、同期。同期みたいな感じだから。
Ehehe, batchmates. Because it feels like we're in the same generation.

393
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:23,556
嬉しい。そうです。でも、ししわたと歌う機会があんまりなくて。
I'm happy. That's right. But I haven't had many chances to sing with ShishiWata.

394
00:39:24,056 --> 00:39:26,256
ね、なかったから。
Yeah, we haven't.

395
00:39:26,556 --> 00:39:33,856
今回なんか、いや、いつでも、いつか、なんか、わため先輩とししろんと歌いたいんだって。
This time... well, I've always wanted to sing with Watame-senpai and Shishiron someday.

396
00:39:34,056 --> 00:39:35,256
セットいいんですか？
Is it okay if we're a set?

397
00:39:35,556 --> 00:39:39,256
嬉しいね！嬉しいね！バリバリ嬉しいね！
We're happy too! So happy! Super happy!

398
00:39:39,556 --> 00:39:43,856
二人の歌声めちゃめちゃだいだいだいだい大好きなので、嬉しい。
I love your singing voices so, so, so much, so I'm happy.

399
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:48,256
ありがとう。うちらもだいだいだい大好きだよ！
Thank you. We love you so much too!

400
00:39:48,556 --> 00:39:50,556
いや、私の方が好きだから。
No, I love her more.

401
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:52,256
いやいや、わための方が好きだから。
No, no, Watame loves her more.

402
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,856
いや、私の方が好きだから。
No, I love her more.

403
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:54,656
やめてよ！
Stop it!

404
00:39:54,856 --> 00:40:00,056
私の方がだいだいだいだい好きだから！どっちが好きなの！？わーー！
I love her so, so, so much! Who do you love more!? Waaah!

405
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:01,464
大好きだわー
I love it!

406
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:02,164
嬉しい
I'm happy!

407
00:40:02,264 --> 00:40:03,564
二人、大好き
I love you two!

408
00:40:06,064 --> 00:40:08,164
でもイナちゃん、なんか服が可愛くなってない？
But Ina-chan, hasn't your outfit become cuter?

409
00:40:08,164 --> 00:40:09,564
そうですね、なんか...
That's right, somehow...

410
00:40:09,564 --> 00:40:10,564
可愛いー
Cute!

411
00:40:10,564 --> 00:40:11,864
なんかドアがあって、
There was this door,

412
00:40:11,864 --> 00:40:15,064
ドアをピョーンとしたらこの衣装になりました。
and when I went through it, I changed into this outfit.

413
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:16,864
へー、可愛いー
Wow, so cute!

414
00:40:16,864 --> 00:40:17,864
似合ってる
It suits you.

415
00:40:18,064 --> 00:40:20,064
よく見たらさ、タコダチ...
If you look closely, the Takodachis...

416
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:22,064
ねー、タコダチがいっぱいですよ、これ。
Right, there are lots of Takodachis on this.

417
00:40:22,064 --> 00:40:23,864
これ、いっぱいおるんやな
There really are a lot of them here.

418
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,064
いたるところに...
They're everywhere...

419
00:40:25,064 --> 00:40:27,864
靴も、タコダチなの、可愛くない？
Even the shoes are Takodachis, aren't they cute?

420
00:40:27,864 --> 00:40:30,064
あ、本当だ、タコダチだ、可愛い
Ah, you're right, they are Takodachis! Cute!

421
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:31,264
おしゃれだねー
Very stylish.

422
00:40:31,264 --> 00:40:32,064
いいねー
It's nice.

423
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:34,564
いやー、でも嬉しい
Wow, I'm just so happy.

00:40:37,564 --> 00:40:41,064
うぅー、あっという間に...

426
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:43,064
いい言葉がわかんない、嬉しいー
I can't find the words, I'm just so happy.

427
00:40:43,064 --> 00:40:44,064
嬉しいー
We're happy too.

428
00:40:44,064 --> 00:40:45,364
こちらこそだよ
The pleasure is ours.

429
00:40:45,364 --> 00:40:46,364
あ、どめ、
Ah, wait,

430
00:40:46,364 --> 00:40:48,564
え、あなた、ちょっと時間があれじゃないの？
hey, you, isn't your time almost up?

00:40:48,564 --> 00:40:50,564
え、もう時間？あ、やばいやばい

はっ！もう行かなきゃかも
Ah! I might have to go already.

434
00:40:53,064 --> 00:40:55,364
え、ハバナの収録、あなたあるんじゃないの？
Wait, don't you have a recording for Havana?

435
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:56,864
やばいやばい、飛行機乗らなきゃ
Oh no, oh no, I have to catch a plane!

436
00:40:56,864 --> 00:40:59,064
ちょっと飛行機乗って行かなきゃだから、イナ、またね！
I have to go catch a plane, so, Ina, see you later!

437
00:40:59,064 --> 00:41:00,564
バイバイ、後でね
Bye-bye, see you later!

438

ありがとうー！バイバイー！
Thank you! Bye-bye!

439
00:41:04,264 --> 00:41:06,564
なんか、なんかおるぞ、なんだあれ？
Wait, something's there. What is that?

440
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,564
なんだこれ、気になるなー
What is this? I'm curious.

441
00:41:08,564 --> 00:41:10,564
急げ急げ、あ、急がなきゃ
Hurry, hurry! Ah, I have to hurry.

442
00:41:12,364 --> 00:41:14,864
Ah... that was so fun!

443
00:41:14,864 --> 00:41:18,564
Ooooh... I got to finally sing with Shishiron,

444
00:41:18,564 --> 00:41:23,064
and of course with Watame-senpai. I'm so, so happy, you know?

445
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:28,564
Huh... they did say they saw something like a dragon? A dragon...?

446
00:41:29,564 --> 00:41:33,064
But uh... after all this singing, I'm guess...
But uh... after all this singing, I guess...

447
00:41:33,064 --> 00:41:36,064
I'm kind of, kind of getting sleepy.

448
00:41:36,064 --> 00:41:39,564
So, I'm just... just gonna take a... small nap, okay?

449
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:43,064
I'm gonna take a small nap. So... okay.

450
00:41:43,564 --> 00:41:46,564
Yeah... I'll just go, go...

恋の歌 響けば
If the song of love resounds

454
00:42:28,264 --> 00:42:32,364
狂い出す歯車
The gears start to go mad

455
00:42:32,364 --> 00:42:36,464
止められぬ宿命が
The unstoppable fate

456
00:42:36,464 --> 00:42:39,264

絆を求めて
Seeking the bond

462

嘘もなく気高く
Noble and without lies

467
00:43:49,764 --> 00:43:53,664
原罪を抱えて
Carrying the original sin

468
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:57,864
理屈無き恋求む
Seeking love without reason

469
00:43:57,864 --> 00:44:01,464

Foolishness

00:56:42,588 --> 00:56:45,388
Man, if it wasn't for him, I'd be stuck as a statue forever.

603
00:56:45,388 --> 00:56:48,388
Don't shake your head too much, he's gonna fly off!

Thank you for saving me!

607
00:56:56,588 --> 00:56:59,288
Well, I think... Are you still going on a journey? Continuing your journey after this?

608
00:56:59,288 --> 00:57:03,288
I am a hero, after all! I gotta go see all the princesses I gotta save in the world!

609
00:57:03,288 --> 00:57:08,188
Excuse me? Huh? It wasn't just me?

610
00:57:08,188 --> 00:57:13,088
Alright, let's go! Happy Birthday!

611
00:57:13,088 --> 00:57:15,088
Well, that's that.

612
00:57:15,088 --> 00:57:19,088
On to the next princess! Let's go!

613
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:30,888
Many days, intense and fairytale-like scenes, pulverized at the end we have seen

614
00:57:30,888 --> 00:57:35,388
A curtain to fall much too soon, to a world such as this

615
00:57:35,388 --> 00:57:39,888
Still voices taking place right on this field, shadows of many vestiges they aim for

616
00:57:39,888 --> 00:57:44,288
There was a hero who took it all for us, a little journey of memories with you

617
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:48,088
勇者
The Hero

618
00:57:48,088 --> 00:57:51,088
Lyrics, Music: Ayase

619
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:59,888
No more pages left in that story, our hero goes into slumber deep

620
00:57:59,888 --> 00:58:04,388
Leaving behind a veil of peace for all, saving the world for us all

621
00:58:04,388 --> 00:58:08,888
The flow of time erases without mercy, any rows of memories and you

622
00:58:08,888 --> 00:58:13,388
Even the traces left in life for now, rustling in time as you said

623
00:58:13,388 --> 00:58:17,888
And yet I'll keep all your hopes, all the words and wishes, courage you won

624
00:58:17,888 --> 00:58:22,388
Still dwell inside me and even now in my heart, keep living through

625
00:58:24,188 --> 00:58:29,688
Odd as it is we share the same path and nothing more to pass, so it should have been

626
00:58:29,688 --> 00:58:34,188
But suddenly I was wondering all those tears rolling down my cheeks, why do they come out and fall?

627
00:58:34,188 --> 00:58:38,688
For I want to find out until we reach right now, if I engage in the journey we went on about again

628
00:58:38,688 --> 00:58:43,188
Though I am no longer walking next to you, one day I know I'll find the truth

629
00:58:52,588 --> 00:58:57,088
Another story unfolds into a journey that alone I set out to

630
00:58:57,088 --> 00:59:01,588
I meet the locals of every town I stop in, they are all recalling the person that you were

631
00:59:01,588 --> 00:59:07,088
Unwavering kindness is something of you, a thing occurring in everything you do

632
00:59:07,088 --> 00:59:11,588
Here and there we can find scattered symbols around, manifesting that all we will prove this

633
00:59:11,588 --> 00:59:16,088
And even back what they mean so one day, I wouldn't find myself alone becoming lonely

634
00:59:16,088 --> 00:59:20,588
And I call to mind every moment of our journey, when I see the signs left in these scenes

635
00:59:29,888 --> 00:59:34,388
Many days, intense and fairytale-like scenes, pulverized at the end we have seen

636
00:59:34,388 --> 00:59:39,888
It was that moment our paths caught meeting, changed 1% of the journey that was me

637
00:59:39,888 --> 00:59:44,388
Even if your courageous steps go into the distance, and for the sake of what everybody can recall

638
00:59:44,388 --> 00:59:50,088
I will bring you along with me into the future shining, taking your hand in mine

639
00:59:50,088 --> 00:59:55,588
And know it all began right at that time, mundane and everyday signs, the moment ignited

640
00:59:55,588 --> 01:00:00,088
And now that you remain, my reflections of those times go on as brightly shining

641
01:00:00,088 --> 01:00:04,588
In these scenes I want to find out until we reach right now, looking back at you standing so proud

642
01:00:05,136 --> 01:00:07,636
Are gently falling right on me without a sound...

643
01:00:07,636 --> 01:00:09,736
I'm perceiving you around...

644
01:00:11,336 --> 01:00:13,536
Story of this journey,

645
01:00:13,536 --> 01:00:15,636
story of the end of hero

646
01:00:15,636 --> 01:00:18,936
forever and ever and ever as you know...

647
01:00:19,436 --> 01:00:22,136
Now a new beginning has to come to be an end

648
01:00:22,136 --> 01:00:24,636
so that you're protected and kept safe...

649

650
01:00:27,636 --> 01:00:29,636
on this journey.

651
01:00:46,636 --> 01:00:50,936
Yay! And then they lived happily ever after.

652
01:00:50,936 --> 01:00:55,136
Or should I say evermore?

653
01:00:57,136 --> 01:00:59,936

It has a different design on each side,

670
01:01:41,136 --> 01:01:43,936
so depending on what you feel like having

01:01:45,636 --> 01:01:48,436

681
01:02:05,936 --> 01:02:07,936
like a little game that you can play

682
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:10,636

717
01:03:36,136 --> 01:03:39,136

719
01:03:41,136 --> 01:03:44,136
