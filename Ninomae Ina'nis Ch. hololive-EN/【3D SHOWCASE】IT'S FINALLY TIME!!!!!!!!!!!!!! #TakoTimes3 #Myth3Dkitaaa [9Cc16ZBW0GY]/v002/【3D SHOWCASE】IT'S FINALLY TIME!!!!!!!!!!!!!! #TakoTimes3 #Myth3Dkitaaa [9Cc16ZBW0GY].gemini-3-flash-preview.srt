INA'NIS 3D SHOWCASE #TakoTimes3

3
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,500
Wha...

4
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,800
Hi everyone!

5
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh, I see all of your comments! Hi!

6
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,000
How are you?

7
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Ah, what time is it?

8
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,500
It's Tako Time!

9
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,500
Ah, hi, hi!

10
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
How are you guys doing?

11
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,000
Are you excited? Good.

12
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, first of all, one thing I, you know, promised you guys...

13
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,500
...was to kabedon as soon as I got the 3D showcase, so...

14
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,000
Kabedon!

15
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,500
Oya oya Takodachis, what are you doing here?
My, my, Takodachis. What are you doing here?

16
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh no... Ah, I was so, so, so, so nervous...

17
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,000
...but you know, let's just, let's just do it normally. Normally. Hi!

18
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Hi! Hi everyone! Isn't it so exciting?

19
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,500
We waited so, so long for this to finally happen.

20
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,500
And it's finally here! It's finally here!

21
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,500
I can't, I can't contain my excitement. I'm sorry.

22
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,500
But you know, I'm going first. You know, usually for relays we ended up with, you know, the debut order...

23
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,000
...but this time for special, special event I'm the first one to go. So I'll do my best...

24
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,500
...but make sure you check out the other three showcases coming up in the upcoming weeks too! Yay!

25
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
But yeah.

26
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
So, first of all, I guess I can show you guys around the place?

27
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,000
Maybe? Maybe? Yeah.

28
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,500
Okay, come here, so follow me. Follow me. Yeah.

29
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So, you guys have maybe a little bit familiar with this place.
So, you guys might be a little bit familiar with this place.

30
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,000
You know, there's some art supplies, you know, my little drawing workspace. Oh!

31
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,500
I guess I haven't really shown you guys how I do traditional art, but...

32
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Someone familiar! Could it be?

33
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,000
AO-chan!

34
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,000
このネクロノミコンがすごい！ 第1位！
This Necronomicon is Amazing! No. 1!

35
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:08,533

This Necronomicon is Amazing! 1st

36
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,333
Al-chan...

37
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:02,533
...in the flesh.

38
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,133
Al-chan's sleeping right now but I guess...

39
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:09,933
...you heard of Ina's back, how about Al-chan's back?

40
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:23,033
TVドラマ化決定！！
TV Drama Adaptation Confirmed!!

41
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:15,033
I guess you don't really see Al-chan's back that often, hey?

42
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:19,433
But apparently the TV drama has been decided on but...

43
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:22,533
...you know, I think it's still in the works.

44
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:25,033
But yeah, this is Al-chan.

45
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:29,033
And I guess you can look around the rest of the room.

46
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:33,433
Well, here's my little bookshelf area. It's not full of books yet but...

47
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:38,233
...there's a couch over there I usually like to sleep on, you know, I sleep everywhere.

48
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:42,433
And yeah, some miscellaneous things and of course, can't forget...

49
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,233
...my streaming desk.

50
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,833
That's right, I stream from here, you know, I go...

51
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:49,033
Tututututu...

52
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:50,033
Hi guys!

53
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:55,233
And you guys see, see the, you know, the view behind me. Yeah, yeah.

54
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:59,333
And then if we walk over a little more this way, you get to see...

55
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:02,533
...more books! I love books.

56
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:09,033
But then there's like a beautiful garden out there, you guys don't really get to see this often, right? Yeah.

57
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:13,433
And of course, can't forget this angle of the room...

58
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:17,533
...which you guys are very familiar with. Yay!

59
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:23,533
This is my little studio. What do you guys think? Isn't it great? Yeah.

60
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:29,033
So exciting!

61
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:35,533
Yeah, you know, I really want to show you guys, you know, this full space and...

62
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:41,533
...finally after what, two, two and a half, maybe two and a half, two years ish? Yeah.

63
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:44,533
Um, yeah, I'm so, so happy.

64
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:50,233
I'm losing my vocabulary here because I'm so, so nervous and happy and...

65
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:52,533
...just flooded with emotions.

66
00:06:53,033 --> 00:07:00,533
But I guess there's one thing you guys have been looking forward to when it comes to 3D streams, so...

67
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:05,233
...something I haven't shown you guys yet.

68
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:11,233
I mean, I've appeared in lives, I've appeared in different shows and programs in my 3D.

69
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:16,233
There's one thing, one thing I've asked to be kept secret until today.

70
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:23,033
What do you think it is? What could it be?

71
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:27,533
That's right! My tentacles. Ina-boinboins.

72
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:32,433
But you know, it's a little, just a little embarrassing so look away...

73
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:35,833
...maybe look away a little bit. Just look away a little bit. Okay.

74
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:42,533
Are you guys ready? Wait. Doon! Tada! Ina-boinboin!

75
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:52,233
Ina-boinboin! That's right, I told you guys, it's not...

76
00:07:52,533 --> 00:08:00,533
...it's not attached to my back, there's like a void gate in there somewhere that they're summoned from, but boinboin!

77
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:06,533
I take so... I'm going to touch them. Don't you just want to squeeze them? You can't.

78
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:10,033
But they're boinboin! Wee!

79
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:19,533
Boinboin boinboin boinboin boinboin boinboin!

80
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:25,533
Okay, calm down Ina, calm down. It'll be okay.

81
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:29,533
Hmm, what do you guys think? Yay!

82
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:37,433
Oh? I got a call? Ah, tentacles, you're kind of in the way. Okay, look away for a second.

83
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:41,533
Look away for a second. Poi! Are they gone? Okay, we good.

84
00:08:40,033 --> 00:09:03,033
CHALLENGE

85
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:47,033
We got a message from Myth! Oh my goodness!

86
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:51,233
A challenge! Hmm, what could they have cooked up for me?

87
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:57,033
Well, they sent some messages for me, so let's see, let's see what they have.

88
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:03,033
Okay, start with Kiara. Pop pop pop!

89
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:09,233
Uwa! Oh, Kikiriki! Hello everybody, this is Takanashi Kiara from Hololive English Myth!

90
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:15,033
Hi Kiara! Your gen-mate. First of all, congratulations on being number one for the range!

91
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:23,533
Thank you! So case, let's go! I'm doing fine right now. No, hopefully. I'm scared.

92
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:30,033
Well, I am here to request a pose or two from you. Okay. So let me start...

93
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:38,233
I want two things. Let me start with I want your best or your cutest idol pose that you can think of in 5 seconds.

94
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:47,233
Idol pose, idol pose! I'll give you 5 seconds to think. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go!

95
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:52,033
Cute! Jeez! Oh, cute! Okay, okay, here we go again.

96
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:57,033
Next one! Next one's next! Okay, okay, okay, next one next. お客みなさん、上から目線でお願いします。
Next one! Next one's next! Okay, okay, okay, next one's next. Everyone, please look from a top-down perspective.

97
00:09:57,533 --> 00:10:00,033
イナちゃんは下の方に。
Ina-chan, please be at the bottom.

98
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,845
Instructions for camera?

99
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:03,845
Yeah, and now Ina...

100
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:06,345
...put your hands together like you're praying.

101
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:08,545
Okay, and do a pouty face.

102
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:13,545
As if you're asking the viewer for some... something.

103
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:15,845
Yes, cookies, like "Onegai"? "Onegai"?
Yes, cookies, like "Please"? "Please"?

104
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:18,445
Credit card number, please!

105
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:22,445
Keep on doing that. Alright.

106
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:24,045
Bye-bye!

107
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:26,545
Bye Kiara! Thank you!

108
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:30,045
CHALLENGE

109
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:32,445
Yeah, Kiara flew over to, you know, somewhere else for now.

110
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:34,545
But yeah, thank you Kiara.

111
00:10:34,545 --> 00:10:38,545
Oh, Idol pose, Idol pose is always tough, you know? But I'll try.

112
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:42,845
Okay, who do we have next? Ame!

113
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:44,245
Hi Ina!

114
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:45,545
Ame!

115
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,445
I'm so proud of you!

116
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:49,045
Oh, thank you Ame!

117
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:54,045
I know it takes a lot of courage to get up and do this stuff in front of a lot of people.

118
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:56,545
You finally made it! Yay!

119
00:10:56,545 --> 00:10:57,545
Yay!

120
00:10:57,545 --> 00:11:03,045
I love watching you move and wave around, the thing you do with your arms, the Wiggle!

121
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:07,445
You know, I already know, you look so cute doing it too.

122
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:10,545
So my pose request is first, you gotta plank.

123
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:15,445
That's right, you gotta get down on the ground and do that trend that people did a long time ago.

124
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:18,545
This is just the first step, okay?

125
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:21,045
Okay, okay.

126
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:23,245
I'll wait. Are you there yet?

127
00:11:23,245 --> 00:11:24,545
No...

128
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:27,545
Okay, okay. Then, if staff doesn't yell at you...

129
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:30,845
...you gotta do the worm!

130
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:36,545
Oh no, staff already is yelling at me, it seems I cannot do the worm.

131
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:39,045
Okay, I can do this though, I can... yes.

132
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:42,545
Is it more of like a full body wave?

133
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:46,545
Yeah, yeah. Ina and her waving arms, tentacles always.

134
00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:50,045
She does it too! And back... and back.

135
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:54,045
Well, hopefully that wasn't too difficult of a pose.

136
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:57,545
Thank you Ina.

137
00:11:57,545 --> 00:12:01,045
Thank you Ame! Love you!

138
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:04,545
Goodbye! I love you Ame! I love you!

139
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:08,545
Oh Ame... Oh Ame is so cute.

140
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:11,845
I can't wait to see her showcase as well!

141
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:14,045
Okay, who do we have next? Oh, from Calli!

142
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:20,545
Hello there Ina, Ina, Ina!

143
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:21,845
Hi Calli!

144
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:28,245
It's me, your boy, your reaper, Mori Calliope of the Myth generation, same one as you! Wow!

145
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:35,545
Oh man, I have a lot to say, but I feel like it might end up being redundant or unnecessary.

146
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:40,445
So I'm just gonna say thanks for being a shoulder for me to lean on, quite literally sometimes.

147
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:46,545
We've had so much fun together between Guilty Gear Strive and playing recorders together...

148
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:50,045
...and hopefully soon we can do the ukulele thing.

149
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:51,545
Oh yeah!

150
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:56,545
But until then, I just want to let you know that you're a great friend that I can always depend upon...

151
00:12:56,545 --> 00:13:00,545
...and I never feel weird talking to you ever.

152
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:06,045
Like, it's always really chill and laid back, and I think it's 'cause you remind me of my art friends from the past.

153
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:10,545
So you're a very important person to me.

154
00:13:10,545 --> 00:13:14,545
And so, since I feel so comfortable around you, I'm gonna ask you to do some poses...

155
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:18,545
...that make you feel uncomfortable. But not in like a weird way...

156
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:22,545
...like in like a way where like it's hard for you to do them.

157
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:28,445
Because everybody here is gonna be asking you to do like cute things, I'm sure, right?

158
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:32,445
Well, I'm here to dish out the real challenges, 'cause life is full of challenges, you know?

159
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:36,545
So... I'm gonna ask you to do the worm.

160
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:38,245
Can you do the worm, Cali... Ina?

161
00:13:38,245 --> 00:13:40,045
Calli! I can't do the worm!

162
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:42,445
I can only do this! I can only do this!

163
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:49,845
I'm guessing the worm might be a little difficult for you, but I want to see you put your back into it, you know? Give it your all.

164
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:54,445
But in the event that you can't do the worm, that's okay, I've prepared a second choice.

165
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:59,245
You may choose between the worm or the splits.

166
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:03,545
She's gonna get me back for this one, isn't she? Oh god.

167
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:07,545
Just you wait Mori Calliope!

168
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:12,445
You should have been nicer to me!

169
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:17,045
I should be nicer to her today because she's the first one debuting 3D, oh man, I'm gonna be in big trouble.

170
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:20,045
Okay, look, Ina. Splits are good for you.

171
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:22,445
They can be good for you. For your health.

172
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,445
Make you flexible, right?

173
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:27,245
That's not in my dictionary.

174
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:31,045
You'll thank me later. Okay, I'll try not to stretch your muscles too bad, whichever one you choose, okay?

175
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:33,445
I'll try, okay.

176
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:37,045
If that happens, I'll give you a massage to make up for it, okay? That's a good deal, though.

177
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:39,245
Not quite as good as Gura, but still.

178
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:44,245
You can count on me, just like I can count on you. Good luck!

179
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:47,445
Thank you Calli! Oh, she disappeared.

180
00:14:47,445 --> 00:15:00,045
Alright. Well, I can't do the worm, so I'll try the splits. I'll try the splits.

181
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:01,357
Okay, I think that's it.

182
00:15:01,357 --> 00:15:03,557
This is... this is as far as I go.

183
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:06,557
You see, I'm not that flexible.

184
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:08,557
See, I can't... oh yeah, I can touch my toes.

185
00:15:12,457 --> 00:15:13,657
Okay, that's as far as...

186
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:15,557
That's as far as I go.

187
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:20,557
I'm sorry, I tried! I tried, chat, I tried.

188
00:15:20,657 --> 00:15:24,357
I practiced, but I just can't touch my toes.

189
00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:30,557
But okay, we have... I think we have one last...

190
00:15:30,657 --> 00:15:32,457
One last message...

191
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:36,557
...from Goombah, Gooba!

192
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:42,357
あっ、
Ah,

193
00:15:43,657 --> 00:15:44,957
あーっ！
Ah!

194
00:15:47,357 --> 00:15:48,857
Hi Ina!

195
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:50,357
Gooba!

196
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:52,257
Ina!

197
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:54,457
I want to watch you do the...

198
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:57,257
...Houshou Marine desu!

199
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,357
Okay.

200
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:00,957
Okay.

201
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:04,257
Good luck with the rest of your...

202
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:05,657
...3D showcase.

203
00:16:06,457 --> 00:16:07,757
Love you, Ina.

204
00:16:07,857 --> 00:16:09,157
Love you, Gura.

205
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:10,557
Heart!

206
00:16:13,457 --> 00:16:15,557
Houshou Marine desu!

207
00:16:16,157 --> 00:16:17,357
Ah...

208
00:16:17,457 --> 00:16:18,557
Uh...

209
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:21,057
How do I do this?

210
00:16:21,157 --> 00:16:22,557
How does it go again?

211
00:16:23,157 --> 00:16:24,257
Chat...

212
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:25,557
I don't know how.

213
00:16:26,557 --> 00:16:28,457
ホロライブ3期生、
Hololive 3rd Gen,

214
00:16:28,557 --> 00:16:30,857
宝鐘マリンですー！
Houshou Marine desu!

215
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:33,557
船長、すみません。
Sencho, I'm sorry.

216
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:34,757
すみません。
I'm sorry.

217
00:16:35,857 --> 00:16:38,257
宝鐘マリンですー！
Houshou Marine desu!

218
00:16:38,857 --> 00:16:39,957
Yeah!

219
00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:46,457
Okay, I'll practice this later.

220
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:47,457
Thank you!

221
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:49,057
Sorry, sorry, Sencho!

222
00:16:52,557 --> 00:16:56,557
But yeah, that was the call from Myth.

223
00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:59,257
Oh, they're honestly...

224
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:01,357
Without them, I really...

225
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:05,557
I mean, WE couldn't be here without each other.

226
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:09,557
So I'm really, really happy they're my genmates...

227
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:13,557
...and that we can finally show you guys our 3D showcases.

228
00:17:14,557 --> 00:17:15,557
Thank you!

229
00:17:16,157 --> 00:17:17,557
And you guys too.

230
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:20,557
Without you guys, you know, this would not have been possible.

231
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:22,557
So thank you very much! Thank you, thank you!

232
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:26,557
Well, you know, we've kind of warmed up now.

233
00:17:27,157 --> 00:17:30,857
I think we can probably move on to something special I prepared for you guys.

234
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:35,557
So you guys are curious how I, you know, craft things from the void?

235
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:39,157
This time, to make it easier for you to understand,

236
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:42,557
I prepared a magical canvas where I can draw something...

237
00:17:42,657 --> 00:17:45,357
...and I can use it as a catalyst.

238
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:48,357
That's right, catalyst, to summon whatever I draw!

239
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:49,657
Surprise!

240
00:17:50,457 --> 00:17:53,057
Okay, let's go over there and bring the canvas over.

241
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:55,357
Tan-tan-tan-tan-tan...

242
00:17:56,257 --> 00:17:58,257
Here is my canvas, yoisho!

243
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:00,657
Woah!

244
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:03,557
It's pretty heavy, but I've been practicing.

245
00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:10,557
Alright, blank canvas. Isn't that so scary?

246
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,557
Number one things artists fear.

247
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:17,457
But let me just grab this magical brush here.

248
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:20,557
Hoick!

249
00:18:21,157 --> 00:18:23,357
Hehe, isn't this brush really big?

250
00:18:23,457 --> 00:18:26,557
I don't know how well I can draw with this, but...

251
00:18:27,157 --> 00:18:29,657
...how about we test out the canvas for a bit, okay?

252
00:18:30,157 --> 00:18:32,457
Actually haven't tested if it works, so...

253
00:18:33,357 --> 00:18:36,457
I'll just draw something really quick.

254
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:38,257
Tan-tan-ta...

255
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:41,057
...and a smile...

256
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:43,157
...and the ring, and done!

257
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:45,357
Speed paint!

258
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:48,357
Who's that?

259
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:49,457
Who's that?

260
00:18:49,557 --> 00:18:52,257
Who's that cutie on the canvas?

261
00:18:53,157 --> 00:18:54,457
It's you!

262
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:58,657
Okay, okay, let me just put down my brush.

263
00:18:58,757 --> 00:18:59,857
Yoisho!

264
00:19:00,157 --> 00:19:03,457
I've prepared a special summoning room just for this occasion.

265
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:06,357
So I'll just bring you guys right on over.

266
00:19:06,457 --> 00:19:08,557
Yoisho, yoisho, okay, let's go!

267
00:19:15,557 --> 00:19:18,557
Yoisho, yoisho, yoisho...

268
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:21,557
Alright, I'll put you guys on...

269
00:19:22,557 --> 00:19:23,557
Yoisho!

270
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:25,857
Okay, are you guys ready?

271
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:28,457
There's a saying amongst artists:

272
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:32,457
If you draw what you want from the gacha, you shall get it.

273
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,357
So it's also called 'Kakkebaderu'.
So it's also called 'Kakkebaderu' (If you draw it, it will appear).

274
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:37,457
So that'll be our magical spell today.

275
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:39,357
Are you guys ready?

276
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:42,557
描けば出るー！
Kakkebaderu!

277
00:19:55,557 --> 00:19:56,857
Woah!

278
00:19:57,157 --> 00:19:58,357
That was...

279
00:19:58,457 --> 00:20:00,057
Wah! T-Tako!

280
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:03,369
Tako... Tako... Tako... Tako...

281
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,669
Tako, you made it!

282
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:07,469
Oh, I have to be careful I don't step on any of you.

283
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:09,569
Tako, oh, you're so cute!

284
00:20:09,569 --> 00:20:11,469
You know, that was my dream, you know?

285
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:14,369
To have you guys join me on this special day.

286
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:15,169
Tako!

287
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:16,869
Tako!

288
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:18,469
Ah, you're so cute!

289
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:20,169
Hi!

290
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:20,869
Oi!

291
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:21,569
Face!

292
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:22,269
Oi!

293
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:24,769
Say hi!

294
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:27,469
Ah, you guys are so cute!

295
00:20:27,469 --> 00:20:28,969
Look at you!

296
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:32,669
Ah...

297
00:20:33,469 --> 00:20:34,269
Wait.

298
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,269
Seems... seems a little empty.

299
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:41,169
Hmm, odd.

300
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:45,369
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

301
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:48,469
Yeah, Tako!

302
00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:50,069
It succeeded!

303
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:52,469
Okay, so the canvas works.

304
00:20:52,469 --> 00:20:53,969
The magical canvas works.

305
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:55,769
So, I'll just... whew!

306
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:56,669
Actually, I'm kidding.

307
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:57,669
I'll let you guys go.

308
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:58,269
There you go.

309
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:01,369
Hmm, since that worked...

310
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:03,569
You know, special occasion...

311
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:06,069
Maybe, just maybe, if we draw...

312
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:08,769
a Hololive member, do you think...

313
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,969
they'll be summoned as well?

314
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:14,369
Well, we can give it a try.

315
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:16,569
Okay, okay, okay.

316
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:17,969
Get my special brush.

317
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:18,569
Hoi!

318
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,069
All right, huh, who should I draw first?

319
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:25,169
Oh, I know, I know, I know!

320
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:28,069
I mean, there's no mistaking this member.

321
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:30,369
I'm sure you guys will guess right away.

322
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:33,269
Hmm...

323
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:35,369
Just to make sure, I'll write this.

324
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,469
Okay...

325
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:38,269
Done with my brush.

326
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:41,569
ん、どや！
Ta-da!

327
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,369
Who could it be, chat?

328
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:47,369
Who could it be? Can you guess?

329
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:49,769
Can you guess?

330
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:52,469
Well, we have a cup here.

331
00:21:52,469 --> 00:21:53,669
And some wings.

332
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:55,769
And the word "BANO". Hmm...

333
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:57,169
Who could it be? Well...

334
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:00,369
Take you to the summoning room.

335
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:03,169
あたたたたたたたた！
Atatatatatatatata!

336
00:22:08,469 --> 00:22:09,969
あたたたたたたたた！
Atatatatatatatata!

337
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:13,669
Hah, I should have built the summoning room a little closer...

338
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:14,969
to the...

339
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:17,169
to the studio, but...

340
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,269
Okay, here we go.

341
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:20,869
おっけばでる！
Okkebaderu!

342
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:27,069
Oh!

343
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:28,369
Is it working? Is it working?

344
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:37,369
やほー！
Yaho!

345
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:38,269
メル先輩！
Mel-senpai!

346
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:38,969
メルです！
It's Mel!

347
00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:39,669
メルです！
It's Mel!

348
00:22:41,469 --> 00:22:44,269
こんかぷー！
Konkapuu!

349
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:45,069
先輩！
Senpai!

350
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,669
嬉しい、嬉しい！
I'm so happy! I'm so happy!

351
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:54,669
あのところで、これ何？これ。
By the way, what is this?

352
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:55,569
何ですかこれ？
What is this?

353
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:56,369
カップですね。
It's a cup.

354
00:22:56,369 --> 00:22:58,369
これメル？これメルってこと？
Is this Mel? Does this mean it's Mel?

355
00:22:58,369 --> 00:22:59,069
カップ。
Cup.

356
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:03,769
先輩じゃなくて、なんか先輩を召喚するために作った...
It's not senpai, it's something I made to summon senpai...

357
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:05,469
It's something I made to summon senpai.

358
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:08,569
メルの似顔絵かと思っちゃったよ。
I thought it was a portrait of Mel.

359
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:10,769
うん、うん、うん。 Don't worry about the letters.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't worry about the letters.

360
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:13,569
文字はちょっとあの大丈夫です。気にしないでください。
Don't worry about the letters. Please don't mind them.

361
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:14,369
BAN...

362
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:15,869
や、BANダメでしょう！
Hey, BAN is bad!

363
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:17,369
BANダメでしょう！
BAN is bad!

364
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:19,469
イナのせっかくの披露目なのに！
Even though it's Ina's special showcase!

365
00:23:19,469 --> 00:23:21,069
BANはダメだよ！
BAN is bad!

366
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:22,769
メル先輩もちょっと...

00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,369

00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:27,469
ダメ、ダメ！ はあ...

Yeah, thanks for joining me today, Mel-senpai. Thank you for coming.

Same here, thank you. Congratulations, Ina!

371
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:35,369
ありがとうございます。
Thank you very much.

372
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:38,269
You know, Mel-senpai was the first senpai I met...

373
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:40,869
when I visited Japan, so you know...

374
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:43,069
when I met her I was like, "Senpai please, please..."

375
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:45,369
"you know, I would love you to take part in the 3D ohirome stream."

376
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:48,369
And she said yes right away, I'm so happy!

377
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:55,569
せっかくだからなんか一緒に撮ろうよ、写真。
Since we're here, let's take a photo together.

378
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:56,569
あ、写真！ うん！
Ah, a photo! Yeah!

379
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:57,969

380
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,669
えーと、どうします？ こ... こんな感じ？
Uh, what should we do? Like... like this?

381
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:02,169
可愛いBAN！
Cute BAN!

382
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:03,969
BANダメですよ。
BAN is not good.

383
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:05,869
可愛いBANって何だ？
What do you mean by "cute BAN"?

384
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:08,569
でも可愛い。先輩可愛い！
But it's cute. Senpai is cute!

385
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:09,569

00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,969
Senpai so soft...

390
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,469
ああ、ソフト！

00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:34,369

00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:48,069

Yeah, yeah, let's play again!

400
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:54,669
Thank you!

00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:58,269
めっちゃおめでとう！ Thank you!
Congratulations! Thank you!

402
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:00,069
それじゃ！

403
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:02,181
メルは魔界に帰るかな。
I think Mel's going to head back to the demon world.

404
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:02,781
Yeah.

405
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:04,281
Bye-bye!

406
00:25:04,281 --> 00:25:05,781
Inasuke, I love you!

407
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:07,481
I love you too!

408
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,681
またね、みんなも。
See you later, everyone too!

409
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,581
Bye-bye!

410
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:11,881
Thank you! Bye!

411
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:16,481
うわあ、メル先輩そうキュート。
Uwaa, Mel-senpai is so cute.

412
00:25:17,581 --> 00:25:20,581
I can't handle it. My heart is melting.

413
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:28,481
Since we know that we can successfully summon some other members,

414
00:25:29,581 --> 00:25:34,481
there is another member I do want to try and summon, you know?

415
00:25:34,681 --> 00:25:38,281
Maybe you guys will know who she is right away.

416
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:40,881
Grab my brush. (Oof!)

417
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,681
All right, I'm ready. Speed paint time.

418
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:47,881
There's no way I can get this wrong, right?

419
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:51,681
So, so, so easy to draw.

420
00:25:53,681 --> 00:25:54,681
Okay, done!

421
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:56,881
ドドン！
Ta-da!

422
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:01,081
Can you guys guess who it is?

423
00:26:01,481 --> 00:26:04,281
Who could it be? Who could it be?

424
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:08,581
We'll see. All right, all right.

425
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:10,781
To the summoning room!

426
00:26:12,581 --> 00:26:15,581
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

427
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:31,481
かけばでる！
If I draw it, she will appear!

428
00:26:31,981 --> 00:26:33,881
かけばでる！
If I draw it, she will appear!

429
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:47,381
ホ？
Huh?

430
00:26:48,581 --> 00:26:50,881
Yukihana Lamy? / 雪花ラミィ？

431
00:26:48,581 --> 00:26:50,081
Lamy? Ina? Lamy?

432
00:26:50,181 --> 00:26:51,881
Lamy? I'm Lamy?

433
00:26:52,581 --> 00:26:55,681
Lamy? Oh, what? Lamy? Lamy? Oh, wait...

434
00:27:00,881 --> 00:27:03,281
Hug me, hug me! Hug me!

435
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:09,181
Chu chu chu! My Ina, Ina, chu chu chu!

436
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:16,881
ダメ！ダメ、ダメ、ダメ！ラミィ、ラミィ、ノー！
No! No, no, no! Lamy, Lamy, no!

437
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:22,581
Okay, okay, I'll try again. I think I messed up. I think I messed up.

438
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:26,081
I messed up here. Okay, go back down. Okay.

439
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:29,181
Seems like I have to be a little more specific when I draw.

440
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:33,281
All right, let me try again. Let me try again.

441
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:38,381
Grab my brush. I'll actually be more specific when I draw this time.

442
00:27:39,581 --> 00:27:43,381
Draw Lamy's cute face here, right here,

443
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:46,881
her flowers, smile, and done!

444
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:50,081
Okay!

445
00:27:52,281 --> 00:27:55,481
How's the speed paint? I think I stepped up my speed painting.

446
00:27:57,881 --> 00:28:00,681
All right, let me just put this down.

447
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:05,581
I gotta save Lamy from being stuck in another form.

448
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:09,581
All right, let's go! Lamy!

449
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:16,981
I'll save you Lamy!

450
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:25,581
Surely, surely it'll work. I drew her more detailed this time, so...

451
00:28:26,881 --> 00:28:28,981
かけばでる！
If I draw it, she will appear!

452
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:43,481
わああ！いなーたん！
Waaa! Ina-tan!

453
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:45,381
Yukihana Lamy / 雪花ラミィ

454
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:45,481
Lamy! Lamy!

455
00:28:46,581 --> 00:28:50,481
I love you Lamy! Whoo!

456
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:52,081
さっきの何？

00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:56,581
え、さっきちょっと、あの、失敗した...

00:28:56,581 --> 00:29:00,681

She's adorable, adorable.

I can't wait. I really want to try her sake, you know?

489
00:30:33,893 --> 00:30:37,093
But, you know, you can't really buy it anywhere 'cause it's so popular.

490
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:41,593
But since, you know, I-I can just shimmy over to Lamy's place... hehe.

491
00:30:41,593 --> 00:30:44,293
Alright, alright, alright.

492
00:30:44,293 --> 00:30:47,393
How about one more? One more, one more member summoning.

493
00:30:47,393 --> 00:30:50,593
I realized I need to draw a lot more details, you know,

494
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:53,393
in order to summon them.

495
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,893
So maybe, you know, I can do a special summon this time.

496
00:30:55,893 --> 00:30:57,693
I can do this. Okay.

497
00:30:57,693 --> 00:30:59,593
Grab my brush.

498
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:01,093
よいしょ。
Yoisho.

499
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:03,593
Alright. Oh, okay.

500
00:31:03,593 --> 00:31:06,593
Okay. I can already imagine her. Yeah.

501
00:31:06,593 --> 00:31:09,593
Okay. Oh yeah, I can't forget the little accessories here.

502
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:14,293
Mmm. Like that, and that.

503
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:21,893
And... yup!

504
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:23,893
And done!

505
00:31:23,893 --> 00:31:26,593
Alright. This one took a little longer, but...

506
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:30,593
hehe. Definitely detailed enough.

507
00:31:30,593 --> 00:31:35,593
Who could it be? Hmm. Hmm. It's not YAGOO.

508
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,593
Hi YAGOO.

509
00:31:37,593 --> 00:31:40,593
Let me put away my brush. よいしょ。
Let me put away my brush. Yoisho.

510
00:31:40,593 --> 00:31:43,093
Who could it be?

511
00:31:43,093 --> 00:31:45,593
There's a Watamelon, mmm, mmm,

512
00:31:45,593 --> 00:31:49,093
and some horns, flower in her hair...

513
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:52,093
our fluffy fluffy Senpai.

514
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:54,893
Okay, let's go, let's go call her

515
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:57,593
in the special summoning room.

516
00:31:57,593 --> 00:31:59,593
よいしょ。
Yoisho.

517
00:31:59,593 --> 00:32:04,093
Alright, a little far, gotta run.

518
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,593
Okay, okay, a little closer this time.

519
00:32:13,593 --> 00:32:15,893
Too much running.

520
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:22,093
よいしょ。 Alright. Yeah.
Yoisho. Alright. Yeah.

521
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:24,593
Okay, good.

522
00:32:24,593 --> 00:32:26,593
Okay, we got this.

523
00:32:26,593 --> 00:32:30,093
描けば出る！
If you draw them, they'll appear!

524
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:44,293
えっ？わっ？えっ？わっ？えっ？
Eh? Wha? Eh? Wha? Eh?

525
00:32:44,293 --> 00:32:46,093

00:32:49,893 --> 00:32:51,593

529
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:54,093

00:32:54,093 --> 00:32:55,893

533
00:33:00,593 --> 00:33:03,593
誰だ？誰がわため先輩に食べられた？
Who? Who was eaten by Watame-senpai?

534
00:33:03,593 --> 00:33:05,593
Who got eaten by Watame-senpai?

535
00:33:05,593 --> 00:33:07,593

572
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:50,093
おおー。わため先輩、
Oh. Watame-senpai,

573
00:34:50,093 --> 00:34:53,093
she's so fluffy and cute.

574
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:55,593
I can't handle it. Ah...

575
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,893
why are they so cute?

576
00:34:57,893 --> 00:35:00,093
My heart... haaa...

577
00:35:00,425 --> 00:35:03,645
My heart's beating not from the running but from how cute they are honestly.

578
00:35:04,025 --> 00:35:06,735
I can't believe I finally got to meet them...

579
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:10,605
...and at such a special day too!

580
00:35:11,455 --> 00:35:17,425
But yeah, you know, um... I think the summoning canvas, special magical canvas worked really well.

581
00:35:17,655 --> 00:35:20,755
But, you know, what if we also drew something different...

582
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:23,825
...like maybe a new stage? New place?

583
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,205
Do you think it'll work?

584
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:30,425
Well, we'll never know until we try, so...

585
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:32,055
...let's give it a try, shall we?

586
00:35:33,355 --> 00:35:34,855
All right, heave-ho...

587
00:35:34,955 --> 00:35:36,855
...get my brush.

588
00:35:36,955 --> 00:35:40,955
This might take a little longer 'cause um, I'm not very good at drawing backgrounds yet.

589
00:35:47,455 --> 00:35:51,455
All right, oh... I hope the brush was a little smaller but...

590
00:35:51,555 --> 00:35:53,455
...I think I got this. Yeah.

591
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:57,255
Okay, as detailed as possible...

592
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,105
...and done! Ta-da!

593
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:06,255
Um... can you guys guess? Guess the stage?

594
00:36:09,255 --> 00:36:13,155
It's pretty good. I mean, it's the best I can do with this brush.

595
00:36:16,555 --> 00:36:19,055
That's right, that's right. Okay, let me just put down this brush.

596
00:36:21,155 --> 00:36:25,855
Ha... okay. Well, we'll see where this takes us. I don't know if it's gonna work but...

597
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:28,255
...we'll see. All right, shall we?

598
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:34,155
Walking over to the summoning room... [humming]

599
00:36:42,255 --> 00:36:44,355
I... I shouldn't have...

600
00:36:44,555 --> 00:36:48,455
Okay... whew. Running up the stairs is such a work.

601
00:36:48,555 --> 00:36:50,255
Okay...

602
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:53,455
One last time.

603
00:36:53,555 --> 00:36:57,655
Kakikebadiru!

Takodachis are crafted from the void by Ina.
They have the ability to shape-shift into anything,
including daily utensils, food, and animals including humans.
Research suggests that they taste like switch cartridges when licked.

ルラリラ ルレリ
Luralia, Lureli.

650
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:48,967
うたかた想い巡る計り
Transient thoughts spinning in balance.

651
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:52,467
伝え見なす地
The ground you walk upon,

652
00:44:52,667 --> 00:44:59,617
その背が拓く明日は
tomorrow revealed by your path.

00:45:01,929 --> 00:45:05,929
Lura lali, lura li...

654
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:17,629
Haa, haa, ha...

655
00:45:17,929 --> 00:45:20,629
I guess we succeeded in

656
00:45:20,629 --> 00:45:23,129
summoning the new stage! Yay!

657
00:45:24,129 --> 00:45:25,629
How was the song?

658
00:45:26,129 --> 00:45:28,129
Isn't this stage so so pretty?

659
00:45:28,629 --> 00:45:30,129
Haaa...

660
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:32,329
Yeah, oh my goodness.

661
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:34,629
I was very nervous, but pulled it off. I did it, yay!

662
00:45:35,129 --> 00:45:37,629
Well, I have another song for you here,

663
00:45:37,629 --> 00:45:41,629
but we're going to have to change things a little bit.

664
00:45:42,129 --> 00:45:44,129
So the next song... hold on, let's do this.

665
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:49,129
Huuu... yiii... hyu!

666
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:51,629
It worked! Okay.

667
00:45:52,629 --> 00:45:56,629
Um, this place might be really familiar for you guys.

668
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,129
I hope you like the next song.

669
00:45:59,329 --> 00:46:01,129
Yeah. Okay.

670
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:11,329
教えて 教えてよ その仕組みを
Tell me, tell me the way it works.

671
00:46:11,329 --> 00:46:14,629
僕の中に誰かいるの？
Is there someone else inside of me?

672
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:25,329
壊れた 壊れたよ この世界で
Broken, it's broken, within this world.

673
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:28,629
君が笑う 何も見えずに
You laugh, without seeing anything.

674
00:46:40,129 --> 00:46:47,129
unravel
Lyrics: Composition: TK

675
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:51,329
壊れた僕なんてさ 息を止めて
A broken person like me, holding my breath.

676
00:46:52,329 --> 00:46:56,629
ほどけない もうほどけないよ
It's unravelling, I can't unravel it anymore,

677
00:46:56,629 --> 00:47:01,129
真実さえ freeze
even the truth is frozen.

678
00:47:02,629 --> 00:47:05,629
壊せる 壊せない
Can break, can't break.

679
00:47:05,629 --> 00:47:08,629
狂える 狂えない
Can go mad, can't go mad.

680
00:47:08,629 --> 00:47:10,629
あなたを見つけて
I found you.

681
00:47:10,629 --> 00:47:13,629
揺れて歪んだ世界にだんだん僕は
In this shaking, distorted world, I'm gradually

682
00:47:13,629 --> 00:47:16,629
透き通って見えなくなって
becoming transparent and invisible.

683
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:20,129
見つけないで 僕のことを
Don't find me.

684
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:23,629
見つめないで
Don't look at me.

685
00:47:24,129 --> 00:47:27,629
誰かが描いた世界の中で
In a world drawn by someone else,

686
00:47:27,629 --> 00:47:31,129
あなたを傷つけたくはないよ
I don't want to hurt you.

687
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:35,129
覚えていて
Remember

688
00:47:35,129 --> 00:47:37,129
僕のことを
me.

689
00:47:48,629 --> 00:47:52,129
無限に広がる孤独が絡まる
Infinitely spreading loneliness entangles me.

690
00:47:52,129 --> 00:47:55,629
無邪気に笑った記憶が刺さって
Memories of innocently laughing pierce me.

691
00:47:56,129 --> 00:47:59,629
動けない 動けない 動けない
Can't move, can't move, can't move,

692
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:03,129
動けない 動けない 動けないよ
can't move, can't move, I can't move!

693
00:48:31,629 --> 00:48:34,629
変わってしまった 変えられなかった
It's changed, it couldn't be changed.

694
00:48:34,629 --> 00:48:38,629
2つが絡まる 2人が滅びる
Two things entwine, two people perish.

695
00:48:39,129 --> 00:48:41,629
壊せる 壊せない
Can break, can't break.

696
00:48:41,629 --> 00:48:44,629
狂える 狂えない
Can go mad, can't go mad.

697
00:48:44,629 --> 00:48:46,629
あなたを汚せないよ
I won't let you be tainted.

698
00:48:46,629 --> 00:48:49,629
揺れて歪んだ世界にだんだん僕は
In this shaking, distorted world, I'm gradually

699
00:48:49,629 --> 00:48:52,629
透き通って見えなくなって
becoming transparent and invisible.

700
00:48:53,129 --> 00:48:56,129
見つけないで 僕のことを
Don't find me.

701
00:48:56,129 --> 00:48:59,629
見つめないで
Don't look at me.

702
00:49:00,129 --> 00:49:03,629
誰かが仕組んだ孤独な罠に
In a lonely trap set by someone,

703
00:49:03,629 --> 00:49:07,129
未来がほどけてしまう前に
before the future unthreads itself,

704
00:49:07,629 --> 00:49:11,129
思い出して
Remember

705
00:49:11,129 --> 00:49:13,129
僕のことを
me,

706
00:49:14,629 --> 00:49:17,629
鮮やかなまま
vivid as it is.

707
00:49:18,129 --> 00:49:21,129
忘れないで 忘れないで
Don't forget, don't forget,

708
00:49:21,129 --> 00:49:24,129
忘れないで 忘れないで
don't forget, don't forget.

709
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:28,629
変わってしまったことに paralyze
Paralyzed by what has changed.

710
00:49:28,629 --> 00:49:32,129
変えられないことだらけの paradise
A paradise full of things that can't be changed.

711
00:49:32,629 --> 00:49:36,129
覚えていて 僕のことを
Remember me.

712
00:49:42,629 --> 00:49:45,629
教えて 教えて
Tell me, tell me.

713
00:49:45,629 --> 00:49:48,629
僕の中に誰かいるの？
Is there someone else inside of me?

We waited over... twoish years.

We planned it out... but then you know, we had to wait so long, but...

you can now have a personal Takodachi to help you hold the lid down in place.

801
00:59:35,628 --> 00:59:40,553
Or it can be a cute little figure too. That's also possible!

802
00:59:40,553 --> 00:59:42,653
Isn't this so cute?

803
00:59:42,653 --> 00:59:46,453
Yeah, I actually, you know, played around with it and you can kind of like push it,

804
00:59:46,453 --> 00:59:50,703
push the Tako down and it like sticks onto your hand. It's very nice.

805
00:59:51,478 --> 00:59:55,453
