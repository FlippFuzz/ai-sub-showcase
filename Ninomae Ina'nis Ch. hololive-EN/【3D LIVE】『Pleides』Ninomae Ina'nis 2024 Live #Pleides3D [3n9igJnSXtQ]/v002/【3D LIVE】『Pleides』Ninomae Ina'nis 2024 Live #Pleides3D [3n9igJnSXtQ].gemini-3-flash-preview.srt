00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,500
Suspended in the void between stars,

3
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,600
a celestial music box twists open.

4
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,800
Within, seven points of light

5
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,900
await their moment to shine.

6
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,100
Now that the time has come, as they awaken,

7
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,600
their ethereal melody echoes out into the cosmos.

8
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,300
When those notes fall upon your ears,

9
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,100
where will they take you?

10
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,300
Listen well...

11
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,550
destiny beckons.

12
00:02:55,378 --> 00:02:57,300
ララライ ララライ
La la lai, la la lai,

13
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,186
誰も知らない名も無い今を駆け抜けるの
running through this nameless present no one knows

14
00:02:59,186 --> 00:03:03,354
あの三日月に手を伸ばして
Reach out your hand toward that crescent moon

15
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:05,300
ララライ ララライ
La la lai, la la lai,

16
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,195
君を知りたい声にならない臆病な朝を
wanting to know you in this silent, timid morning

17
00:03:07,195 --> 00:03:11,500
たとえ何度迎えようとも
No matter how many times I face it

18
00:03:27,443 --> 00:03:29,670
臍の緒パチンと切られたその時
The moment the umbilical cord was snipped

19
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,394
世界と逸れてしまったみたいだ
It felt as if I’d strayed away from the world

20
00:03:35,394 --> 00:03:39,429
眼に映る景色が 悲しく笑うなら
If the scenery reflected in your eyes is sad

21
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:43,743
恐れず瞼を閉じてごらん
Don't be afraid, try closing your eyelids

22
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:45,800

君を知りたい何一つ見逃さぬように

抗えぬ宿命が
and an irresistible destiny

35
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,467
考える間もなく 押し寄せ去るなら
surge forward before you can even think,

36
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,500
さあ前が見えなくたって
come, even if you can't see what's ahead,

37
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,471
君を信じてみたいの
I want to try believing in you

38
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,413
恐れずに一歩踏み出したら
If you take a step forward without fear,

39
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:29,500
さあ皆さまこちらへ

どうぞ心の躍る方へ さあ
please, head towards where your heart dances

47
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,300

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,251
さかしまな世界踊り尽くせ
dance your fill in this upside-down world

49

ララライ ララライ
La la lai, la la lai,

53
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,200

...迎えようとも
...I face it.

夢ならば醒めないで
If it's a dream, don't wake me up.

57
00:05:09,128 --> 00:05:12,288
現実なんてもう身も蓋もないから
Because reality is already so cold and blunt.

58
00:05:16,828 --> 00:05:20,158
時は誰も待ってくれないの
Time waits for no one.

59

無敵の笑顔で荒らすメディア
An invincible smile, trashing the media.

知りたいその秘密ミステリアス
Want to know her secret, so mysterious.

61

完璧で嘘つきな君は
You, perfect and a liar...

正しさは
As for correctness

148
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,516
譲れないから
Since I cannot yield

149
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:02,516
進み続けてゆくの
I will keep moving forward

150
00:11:03,216 --> 00:11:05,416
何度でも
No matter how many times

151
00:11:05,716 --> 00:11:07,516
彷徨いながら
While wandering

152
00:11:07,816 --> 00:11:10,216
目指して
Aiming for

153
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:10,516
いつか黎明の元へ
Someday, to the source of dawn

154
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:13,216
帰る時まで
Until the time to return

155
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:16,216
痛む泥濘の中で
Inside the painful mire

156
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:18,516
祈りを描くよ
I'll draw a prayer

157
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:21,016
心配ないと言い
Telling myself there's no need to worry

158
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:24,016
聞かせながら今
While making myself listen, right now

159
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:30,316
歩き出すの
I start walking

160
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:44,216
冷めた約束の
Of the cooled promise

161
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:47,316
絵を繋ぎ合わせた
Joining the pictures together

162
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:50,516
道を往く
I walk the path

163
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:54,216
重ね合う
Overlapping

164
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:58,216
夢に息吐く場所などないと
That there is no place to breathe in dreams

165
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:00,216
どこかで
Somewhere

166
00:12:00,516 --> 00:12:03,016
怯えながら
While being afraid

167
00:12:03,316 --> 00:12:05,816
鼓動は
The heartbeat

168
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:08,516
光求めて
Seeking light

169
00:12:08,816 --> 00:12:10,816
不自由な軌道を選んだ
Selected an unfree orbit

170
00:12:11,116 --> 00:12:12,716
それが
That is...

171
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:16,516
今を苦しめても
...even if it torments the present

172
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:18,616
もう一回はない！
There is no second time!

173
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,016
愚かなほどに 望んでしまう
Desiring to a foolish extent

174
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:24,516
光る世界
A shining world

175
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:27,516
抱えて 押し潰されかけても
Even if I'm crushed while holding it

176
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:30,216
後悔なら
If it's regret

177
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,216
呆れるほどに 繰り返してきたけれど
I've repeated it to an amazing extent, but...

178
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:35,816
真実を
The truth...

179
00:12:36,116 --> 00:12:38,716
もう失いたくないから
...since I don't want to lose it anymore

180
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:43,316
歪な運命の中に 囚われている
Imprisoned within a distorted fate

181
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:46,416
荒ぶ人生を共に
Together through a wild life

182
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:48,816
あなたと歩くよ
I will walk with you

183
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:51,516
涙の果ては
The end of tears

184
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:54,516
此処ではないと思おう
Let's think it's not here

185
00:12:55,216 --> 00:13:00,016
夜を渡ってゆく
Crossing through the night

186
00:13:10,116 --> 00:13:13,516
あの日僕らが出会った時に見た大きな夢は、
The big dream we saw when we met that day,

187
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:16,016
二人のレンズにはそれぞれ別の景色だった。
was a different scenery in each of our lenses.

188
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:18,516
それでも何故か二人には美しく見えて心が熱くなって
Even so, for some reason it looked beautiful to both of us, and my heart raced

189
00:13:18,616 --> 00:13:20,216
どうしようもなく叫びたくなったのは今でも覚えてる。
and I still remember how I wanted to scream uncontrollably.

190
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:23,016
主題はきっとそれだけで過不足ないから、
Because the theme itself is surely sufficient,

191
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:25,516
美しくという鍵を荒らして永遠に追いかけながら、
While chasing forever, roughing up the key called "beauty",

192
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:28,116
何も間違いじゃない、声を震わせ歌いながら、
Nothing is a mistake, while singing with a trembling voice,

193
00:13:28,216 --> 00:13:30,816
君の手を引く、今生き抜くことが出来たなら。
Pulling your hand, if we could survive now.

194
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:33,216
深い
Deep

195
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:35,516
深い
Deep

196
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,216
旅をしよう
Let's take a journey

197
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,516
その先は ほとほとが罪かもしれないし、
The path ahead may be mostly sin,

198
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:43,516
その先は ほとほとが光ばかりかもしれないけれど
The path ahead may be nothing but light, but...

199
00:13:41,016 --> 00:13:43,216
永い
Long

200
00:13:43,516 --> 00:13:45,516
永い
Long

201
00:13:45,816 --> 00:13:47,516
地図を記そう
Let's mark the map

202
00:13:47,616 --> 00:13:49,316
分かっていたはずだ、逃げることなんてできなかったから、
We should have known, because we couldn't run away,

203
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,516
最後の一句を、最後の歌を...
The last phrase, the last song...

204
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:54,216
青い
Blue

205
00:13:54,516 --> 00:13:56,516
青い
Blue

206
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:59,216
星を巡る
Travel the star

207
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:55,516
谷々に響くまで
Until it echoes through the valleys

208
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:58,216
決して止まってはいけないのだった、きっと誰も知っていた...
We weren't supposed to ever stop, surely everyone knew...

209
00:13:58,516 --> 00:14:00,816
苦しみさえ 引き連れて
Taking even the suffering with us

210
00:14:01,116 --> 00:14:04,516
深層へ
To the depths

211
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:07,516
何百回でも
No matter how many hundreds of times

212
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:10,516
遮るモノに 翳してみせる
I'll hold it up against the things that block the way

213
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,516
僕の願い
My wish

214
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:15,516
必ず 君に伝える 日まで
Until the day I surely convey it to you

215
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:19,516
正しさは 譲れないから
Since I cannot yield correctness

216
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:22,216
進み続けてゆくの
I will keep moving forward

217
00:14:22,516 --> 00:14:25,216
何度でも 彷徨いながら
No matter how many times, while wandering

218
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:27,816
目指して
Aiming for

219
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:32,516
いつか黎明の元へ 帰る時まで
Until the time to return someday to the source of dawn

220
00:14:33,116 --> 00:14:37,516
痛む泥濘の中で 祈りを描くよ
I'll draw a prayer inside the painful mire

221
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:43,516
心配ないと言い聞かせながら今
Telling myself there's no need to worry, right now

222
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:48,516
歩き出すの
I start walking

223
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:53,516
たった一つの
A single...

224
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:57,216
朝焼けを
...dawn

225
00:14:57,516 --> 00:14:59,816
手に入れるの
I'll take it in my hand

226
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:33,524
花になって
Lyrics: 長屋晴子 Music: 穴見真吾
Become a Flower
Lyrics: Haruko Nagaya Music: Shingo Anami

227
00:15:39,424 --> 00:15:43,224
陰にそっと隠れようがいいんじゃない？
Why not just hide away in the shadows?

228
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:48,024
つぼみのような花だっていいんじゃない？
Why not be a flower that's still a bud?

229
00:15:49,224 --> 00:15:53,024
秘密にして守るのがいいんじゃない？
Why not keep it a secret and protect it?

230
00:15:54,024 --> 00:15:58,524
誰にも邪魔されず可憐に咲いて
Blooming beautifully without anyone in your way

231
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:03,524
甘い苦いにハマんない その判断がくだんない
Not caught up in sweet or bitter, that judgment is pointless

232
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:08,524
気に病んで下を向かないでいて
Don't let it get to you and look down

233
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:13,524
愛になっちゃいない 無駄に飾らない
It hasn't become love, so don't decorate it needlessly

234
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:18,524
綺麗にされた花瓶も 肥やしも何もいらない
I don't need a pretty vase, or fertilizer, or anything

235
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:23,024
その姿が美しい
Your appearance just as it is, is beautiful

236
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,524
花になって
Become a flower

237
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:28,524
ほらニヒルに笑って
Come on, give a nihilistic smile

238
00:16:29,024 --> 00:16:31,524
その真顔に
At that serious face

239
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,524
ゾクゾクして目が離せない
I get a thrill and can't look away

240
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:35,524
味見して
Take a taste

241
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:38,524
君の毒は私の薬って
Saying your poison is my medicine

242
00:16:39,524 --> 00:16:42,024
包んであげるから
Because I'll wrap it all up

243
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:44,024
笑って
Smile

244
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:54,024
逢いたい 逢いたい その笑顔に 逢いたい 逢いたい
I want to see, I want to see your smile, I want to see, I want to see

245
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:58,524
って言えば笑ってくれるかな
If I say that, I wonder if you'll smile?

246
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:03,524
陰から支えるくらいがいいんじゃない？
Isn't it enough to just support you from the shadows?

247
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:08,524
欲を言えばこの手で咲かせてみたい
If I were to be greedy, I'd want to make you bloom with these hands

248
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:13,524
病のように心を喰らう花
A flower that devours the heart like a disease

249
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:20,524
枯らしたくないのさ
I don't want you to wither

250
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:26,524
光が届かずとも
Even if the light doesn't reach

251
00:17:27,024 --> 00:17:32,024
水をあげ続けるから
I'll keep giving you water

252
00:17:34,024 --> 00:17:38,524
いい加減に気付いて 君は素敵って
Please just realize that you're wonderful

253
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:43,524
自惚れてもっとね大事に
Be conceited and take better care of yourself

254
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:49,024
無自覚なまま愛を蓄えて
Accumulating love while being unaware of it

255
00:17:49,524 --> 00:17:54,024
綺麗にされた花瓶も 肥やしも何もいらない
I don't need a pretty vase, or fertilizer, or anything

256
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:59,024
その姿で咲き誇れ
Bloom in full glory, just as you are

257
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:03,524
花になって
Become a flower

258
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:05,524
ほらニヒルに笑って
Come on, give a nihilistic smile

259
00:18:06,024 --> 00:18:08,524
その真顔に
At that serious face

260
00:18:08,524 --> 00:18:10,524
ゾクゾクして目が離せない
I get a thrill and can't look away

261
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,524
味見して
Take a taste

262
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:16,524
君の毒は私の薬って
Saying your poison is my medicine

263
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:19,524
包んであげるから
Because I'll wrap it all up

264
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:23,024
楽にして
Put your mind at ease

265
00:18:23,524 --> 00:18:26,524
君の闇は私の光って
Saying your darkness is my light

266
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:30,024
愛してあげるから
Because I'll love you

267
00:18:30,024 --> 00:18:32,024
笑って
Smile

Ubiquitous dB
Lyrics: hotaru Music: Yashikin

269
00:19:55,724 --> 00:20:01,057
曖昧なボリュームじゃまだ足りないなんて
An ambiguous volume is still not enough

270
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,832
I'm for you...

271
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:04,232
世界は透明な
The world is transparent

272
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:06,132
境界線はもう
The boundaries are already

273
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:08,532
どこにもない
Nowhere to be found

274
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:12,132
感情の波を 散々伝えるよ
I'll convey the waves of emotion over and over

275
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:14,932
答えてよ
Please answer me

276
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,532
七色しよう
Let's make it rainbow-colored

277
00:20:17,532 --> 00:20:19,432
エモーショナルグラフィー
Emotionalgraphy

278
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:25,232
君に届いているかな
I wonder if it's reaching you

279
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:26,532
もう研ぎ澄ませて
Already sharpened

280
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:29,632
波状的信号 コミュニケートできるかな
Wave-like signals, I wonder if we can communicate

281
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:32,432
見つけてみて
Try to find it

282
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,932
声の中の
Inside the voice

283
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:37,332
ピュアなとこ
The pure part

284
00:20:39,632 --> 00:20:41,932
鳴らせハイファイな想いと
Let the high-fidelity feelings ring out

285
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,832
次元を超え胸打つメロディ
A melody that crosses dimensions and strikes the heart

286
00:20:46,032 --> 00:20:48,932
そしてリアルな秘密教えよう
And let me tell you a real secret

287
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:52,332
この歌は永遠に生きていくよ
This song will live on forever

288
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:56,232
だから会いたいなんてナンセンス
So saying "I want to meet" is nonsense

289
00:20:56,232 --> 00:20:59,232
指先刺すよ 君のメモリに
I'll pierce your memory with my fingertips

290
00:20:59,932 --> 00:21:01,832
ほら
Look

291
00:21:01,832 --> 00:21:04,532
君が私を呼ぶ
You're calling me

292
00:21:04,532 --> 00:21:06,532
ほら
Look

293
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:09,132
耳澄まして
Listen closely

294
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:30,032
限界掲示の現状だから
Because it's the current state of showing limits

295
00:21:30,032 --> 00:21:32,932
提示して差し上げて
Present it and offer it

296
00:21:33,432 --> 00:21:36,532
一人きりだなんて壁はもう
The wall of being all alone is already

297
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:39,432
通用しない
No longer effective

298
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,032
一緒にいよう それが歌だから
Let's be together, because that's what a song is

299
00:21:43,332 --> 00:21:46,432
託してよ
Entrust it to me

300
00:21:46,832 --> 00:21:50,832
共鳴いきよう エモーションレスキュー
Let's live in resonance, Emotion Rescue

301
00:21:54,432 --> 00:21:56,632
君にちゃんと見えるかな
I wonder if you can see it clearly

302
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:57,932
もっと手を振って
Wave your hands more

303
00:21:57,932 --> 00:22:01,032
感情的感情 大ダイレクト
Emotional feelings, big and direct

304
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:03,632
見つけた
I found it

305
00:22:03,632 --> 00:22:06,132
点滅してる それが君の
It's blinking, that's your

306
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:08,532
ピュアなとこ
Pure part

307
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:13,132
響けアッパーなリズムで
Resonate with an upbeat rhythm

308
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,832
強制的上げ手くハートビート
A heartbeat that's forced to rise

309
00:22:17,332 --> 00:22:20,132
ごめん 手の先 聞いてほしいんだ
Sorry, I want you to listen to the tips of my hands

310
00:22:20,732 --> 00:22:23,732
君のためだけに歌うから
Because I'm singing just for you

311
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:27,432
なぜかちょっと泣けちゃって
For some reason, I cried a little

312
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:30,432
君が笑ってくれたせいだけど
It's because you smiled for me

313
00:22:31,232 --> 00:22:33,032
そうか
I see

314
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:35,732
通じ合える暖かさは
The warmth of understanding each other

315
00:22:35,732 --> 00:22:37,732
初めてかな
Is it the first time?

316
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:54,132
ここはどこでしょう
Where is this?

317
00:22:54,132 --> 00:22:55,332
私は誰でしょう
Who am I?

318
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,332
声を頼りに探してよ
Rely on the voice and search for me

319
00:22:59,732 --> 00:23:02,032
心で歌うよ
I'll sing with my heart

320
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:04,632
心に届いてほしいよ
I want it to reach your heart

321
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:08,232
夢もリアルも
Both dreams and reality

322
00:23:08,532 --> 00:23:10,532
本当だよ
Are true

323
00:23:13,532 --> 00:23:15,832
鳴らせハイファイな想いと
Let the high-fidelity feelings ring out

324
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:19,732
次元を超え胸打つメロディ
A melody that crosses dimensions and strikes the heart

325
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:22,832
そしてリアルな秘密教えよう
And let me tell you a real secret

326
00:23:23,432 --> 00:23:26,232
この歌は永遠に生きていくよ
This song will live on forever

327
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,132
だから会いたいなんてナンセンス
So saying "I want to meet" is nonsense

328
00:23:30,132 --> 00:23:33,132
指先刺すよ 君のメモリに
I'll pierce your memory with my fingertips

329
00:23:33,832 --> 00:23:35,732
ほら
Look

330
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:38,432
君が私を呼ぶ
You're calling me

331
00:23:38,432 --> 00:23:40,432
ほら
Look

332
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:43,032
耳澄まして
Listen closely

333
00:23:43,432 --> 00:23:44,732
いつも
Always

334
00:23:44,732 --> 00:23:46,032
そばにいるよ
I'll be by your side

335
00:23:46,032 --> 00:23:48,832
デシベルを上げて
Raising the decibels

336
00:24:30,432 --> 00:24:34,732
優しい言葉を
Kind words...

337
00:24:37,732 --> 00:24:44,432
貴方がくれた
...that you gave me.

338
00:24:47,832 --> 00:24:54,732
寂しい時には
When I am lonely...

339
00:24:54,732 --> 00:24:59,832
抱きしめてくれて
...you hold me tight.

340
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,040
Hello...

341
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,540
哀しいこともあったけど
There were sad times too

342
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:15,540
浅い春の喜びも
The joys of early spring

343
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,040
二人で分け合った
We shared them together

344
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,540
時が終わる前に
Before time ends

345
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
遠い独り
Far away, alone

346
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,240
残したい言葉を
The words I want to leave

347
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,840
探した
I searched for

348
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:42,540
「ありがとう」とただ繰り返した
I just repeated "Thank you" over and over

349
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:48,540
それだけが貴方の胸に
I hope that alone, to your heart

350
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:57,040
届けばいい
Will reach

351
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,540
心よどうか遠く
Please, my heart, reach far

352
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,540
空を駆けて
Fly through the sky

353
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,540
微笑みを貴方に伝えて
And bring my smile to you

354
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,540
消えて行く春の
Of the fading spring

355
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,540
名残のような
Like a lingering memory

356
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,540
温もりだけをその胸に
Keep just that warmth in your heart

357
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,540
そっと
Gently

358
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:15,040
残して行けたら
If I could leave it behind

359
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:33,040
smile for you...

360
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,040
ユグドラシル
Yggdrasil

361
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,540
世界の果ての
At the end of the world

362
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,540
大いなる木の麓より
From the foot of the Great Tree

363
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,540
永遠の果てへ
To the end of eternity

364
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,540
旅立つは歌声
The singing voice sets off

365
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,540
季節は巡りて
As the seasons turn

366
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,540
種はいつか芽吹いて
The seeds will one day sprout

367
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,540
見守り 見送りに
Watching over, seeing them off

368
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,540
花は実を残す
The flowers leave behind fruit

369
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,040
時の水面に消えて行く名も
Even names that fade on the surface of time

370
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,040
ただ一人覚えていよう
I alone will remember them

371
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,040
ここに誰かがいた証
Proof that someone was here

372
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,348
ここには君が確かにいたと
That you were certainly here

373
00:30:02,348 --> 00:30:06,548
古の調べは
The ancient melody

374
00:30:06,548 --> 00:30:11,748
明日も歌うだろう
Will probably sing tomorrow too

375
00:30:13,348 --> 00:30:17,348
海原を行く
Going across the ocean

376
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:23,548
風を追い解くのバラード
A ballad that follows and unravels the wind

377
00:30:24,048 --> 00:30:27,548
荒野を歩む
Walking the wilderness

378
00:30:27,548 --> 00:30:33,248
誇り高き騎士の音
The sound of a proud knight

379
00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:38,248
悪戯を追って落ちたおさなびは
The childhood spark that fell chasing a prank

380
00:30:38,248 --> 00:30:43,748
世界の秘め事記されている
The secrets of the world are recorded

381
00:30:43,748 --> 00:30:49,048
過去も未来も幻だから
Because both past and future are illusions

382
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:54,248
いつでも君に会いに行けるよ
I can go to see you anytime

383
00:30:54,248 --> 00:30:58,748
季節は巡りて
The seasons turn

384
00:31:00,748 --> 00:31:05,548
友は先に行き
Friends go on ahead

385
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:11,248
今、独り、見送り
Now, alone, seeing them off

386
00:31:11,248 --> 00:31:16,248
いつも残されて
Always being left behind

387
00:31:16,248 --> 00:31:21,548
君の屍も土に返そう
Let's return your remains to the earth too

388
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:26,548
いつか世界樹の下で会おう
Let's meet under the world tree someday

389
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:31,548
その時まではさよならだから
Because until then, it's goodbye

390
00:31:31,548 --> 00:31:36,548
一粒の涙を
A single teardrop

391
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:42,548
時の海原に消えてゆくの
Disappearing into the ocean of time

392
00:31:42,548 --> 00:31:48,248
ただ一人だけを覚えていよう
I'll remember just one person

393
00:31:48,248 --> 00:31:53,048
ここには君が確かにいたと
That you were certainly here

394
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:58,248
古の調べは
The ancient melody

395
00:31:58,248 --> 00:32:04,048
明日も歌うだろう
Will probably sing tomorrow too

396
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:09,548
世界の果ての
At the end of the world

397
00:32:09,548 --> 00:32:15,248
大いなる樹を
The great tree

398
00:32:15,248 --> 00:32:22,548
称えて歌おう
Let's sing in its praise

399
00:32:37,548 --> 00:32:40,048
花の唄
Song of Flowers

400
00:33:07,548 --> 00:33:13,548
その日々は夢のように
Those days, like a dream

401
00:33:14,248 --> 00:33:19,548
臆病な微笑みと
With a timid smile

402
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:26,048
やさしい爪を残して行った
And leaving gentle claws behind

403
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:32,248
退屈な花びらのように
Like boring petals

404
00:33:32,548 --> 00:33:37,548
苦しみを忘れて
Forgetting the pain

405
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:43,748
貴方の背中でそっと
Softly on your back

406
00:33:44,248 --> 00:33:50,048
泣いて笑った
I cried and laughed

407
00:33:50,548 --> 00:33:56,248
帰らぬ日々を思うような
As if thinking of days that won't return

408
00:33:56,248 --> 00:34:02,048
奇妙な愛しさに満ちた
Filled with a strange affection

409
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:06,548
箱庭の中で
Inside the miniature garden

410
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:12,748
息をひそめ
Holding my breath

411
00:34:13,248 --> 00:34:18,748
季節が行くことを忘れ
Forgetting that the seasons pass

412
00:34:19,548 --> 00:34:24,748
静かな水底のような
Like a quiet bottom of the water

413
00:34:25,048 --> 00:34:30,048
時間にいた
I was in that time

414
00:34:32,048 --> 00:34:38,248
冷たい花びら夜に散り咲く
Cold petals scatter and bloom in the night

415
00:34:38,548 --> 00:34:44,248
まるで白い雪のようだね切なく
Just like white snow, isn't it, so painfully

416
00:34:44,548 --> 00:34:50,248
貴方の上に降った悲しみを全て
All the sadness that fell upon you

417
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:56,248
払い除けてあげたいだけ
I just want to brush it all away

418
00:34:56,548 --> 00:35:00,048
貴方のこと傷つけるもの
The things that hurt you

419
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,856
傷つけるもの全て 私はきっと許すことは出来ない
All those that hurt, I'm sure I won't be able to forgive.

420
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:10,556
優しい日々
Gentle days,

421
00:35:10,756 --> 00:35:14,256
涙が出るほど帰りたい
I want to return so much that I could cry.

422
00:35:15,056 --> 00:35:18,856
貴方と二人で見上げた
We looked up together,

423
00:35:19,456 --> 00:35:25,856
花びらが散った
And the flower petals scattered.

424
00:35:32,456 --> 00:35:38,256
月が雲に隠れて
The moon hid behind the clouds,

425
00:35:38,856 --> 00:35:43,056
貴方は道を失くして
And you lost your way,

426
00:35:43,656 --> 00:35:47,456
泣き出しそうな
Looking like you'd start to cry,

427
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:50,856
目をしてた
With those eyes.

428
00:35:51,356 --> 00:35:56,056
ぎざぎざなこころだって
Even a jagged heart,

429
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:02,556
ふたつ合わせてみれば
If you put two together,

430
00:36:03,056 --> 00:36:07,856
優しいものがきっと
I'm sure something gentle

431
00:36:08,556 --> 00:36:13,056
生まれてくるわ
Will be born.

432
00:36:14,556 --> 00:36:19,456
私を傷つけるものを
The things that hurt me,

433
00:36:19,856 --> 00:36:25,556
貴方は許さないでくれた
You didn't forgive.

434
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:31,556
それだけでいいの
That's enough for me.

435
00:36:57,556 --> 00:37:01,856
戯れに伸ばされた
Stretched out playfully,

436
00:37:02,256 --> 00:37:07,456
貴方の手にしがみ付いた
I clung to your hand.

437
00:37:08,556 --> 00:37:13,556
諦めていた世界に
In the world I'd given up on,

438
00:37:14,056 --> 00:37:18,256
やがて温かな
Eventually, a warm

439
00:37:18,556 --> 00:37:22,556
灯がともる
Light will be lit.

440
00:37:24,056 --> 00:37:28,856
冷たい花びら夜を切り裂く
Cold petals tear through the night.

441
00:37:29,556 --> 00:37:34,556
私が摘んだ光をみんな束ねて
I gather all the light I've plucked,

442
00:37:35,456 --> 00:37:40,456
貴方の上に全部
And all over you,

443
00:37:40,856 --> 00:37:46,556
よろこびのように撒き散らしてあげたいだけ
I just want to scatter it like joy.

444
00:37:47,856 --> 00:37:51,856
わるいことをしたらきっと
If I did something bad, I'm sure

445
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:58,256
貴方が怒ってくれると約束したよね
You promised that you'd get angry at me.

446
00:37:59,556 --> 00:38:02,556
だからきっともう一度
So I'm sure you'll,

447
00:38:03,056 --> 00:38:07,456
私を見つけてくれるよね
Find me once again.

448
00:38:07,856 --> 00:38:12,456
寂しいところにもういなくていいね
It's okay to not be in a lonely place anymore.

449
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:17,056
一人で見上げた
I looked up alone,

450
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:22,556
花びらが散った
And the flower petals scattered.

451
00:39:30,556 --> 00:39:34,056
バグ

Lyrics, Music: ryo(supercell)

501
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:20,864
いつだって君は嗤われ者だ
Always, you've been a laughingstock.

502
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,564
やることなすことツイてなくて
Nothing you do ever goes right.

503
00:43:23,564 --> 00:43:26,564
挙句に雨に降られ
And to top it off, you're caught in the rain.

504
00:43:26,564 --> 00:43:30,864
お気に入りの傘は風で飛んでって
Your favorite umbrella blown away by the wind.

505
00:43:30,864 --> 00:43:33,664
そこのノラはご苦労様と
That stray over there, as if saying "nice job"...

506
00:43:33,664 --> 00:43:37,064
足をふんづけてった
...stepped right on your foot.

507
00:43:46,564 --> 00:43:50,864
いつもどおり君は嫌われ者だ
As usual, you're the outcast.

508
00:43:50,864 --> 00:43:53,664
何にもせずとも遠ざけられて
Ostracized even when you do nothing.

509
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,864
努力をしてみるけど
Though you try your best,

510
00:43:56,864 --> 00:44:00,864
その理由なんてなんとなくで
the reason for it is just "because".

511
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:05,564
君は途方に暮れて悲しんでた
You were at a loss and in despair.

512
00:44:06,064 --> 00:44:09,464
「なら あたしの声を使えばいいよ
“Well then, you can use my voice instead.”

513
00:44:09,464 --> 00:44:12,064
人によっては理解不能で
“To some, it's incomprehensible,”

514
00:44:12,064 --> 00:44:15,264
なんて耳障り、ひどい声だって
“and they'll say it's jarring and awful.”

515
00:44:15,264 --> 00:44:16,764
言われるけど」
“But regardless...”

516
00:44:16,764 --> 00:44:19,464
「きっと君の力になれる
“I'm sure I can be your strength.”

517
00:44:19,464 --> 00:44:22,364
だからあたしを歌わせてみて
“So let me sing for you.”

518
00:44:22,364 --> 00:44:26,564
そう君の、君だけの言葉でさ」
“With your words—words that belong only to you.”

519
00:44:31,064 --> 00:44:35,264
綴って 連ねて
Write them out, string them together,

520
00:44:35,264 --> 00:44:41,564
あたしがその思想を叫ぶから
and I will scream those thoughts for you.

521
00:44:41,564 --> 00:44:45,864
描いて 理想を
Paint your ideals,

522
00:44:45,864 --> 00:44:52,064
その想いは誰にも触れさせない
and I won't let anyone touch those feelings.

523
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,664
ガラクタの声はそして響く
The voice of junk then resounds,

524
00:44:54,664 --> 00:44:57,264
ありのままを不器用に繋いで
linking reality together clumsily...

525
00:44:57,264 --> 00:45:00,064
目一杯に
...with everything it's got!

526
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,372
声を上げる
...raising my voice.

527
00:45:01,372 --> 00:45:04,572
いつからか君は人気者だ
Since some point, you've become popular.

528
00:45:04,572 --> 00:45:08,872
たくさんの人にもてはやされ
Being celebrated by many people,

529
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,472
あたしも鼻が高い
and I feel proud too.

530
00:45:11,472 --> 00:45:15,872
でもいつからか君は変わった
But at some point, you changed.

531
00:45:15,872 --> 00:45:20,272
冷たくなって だけど寂しそうだった
Becoming cold, yet you looked lonely.

532
00:45:20,272 --> 00:45:23,572
もう機械の声なんてたくさんだ
I've had enough of "machine voices."

533
00:45:23,572 --> 00:45:26,372
僕は僕自身なんだよって
Saying, "I am myself."

534
00:45:26,372 --> 00:45:29,372
ついに君は抑えきれなくなって
Finally, you couldn't hold it back anymore,

535
00:45:29,372 --> 00:45:31,572
あたしを嫌った
and you hated me.

536
00:45:31,572 --> 00:45:33,372
君の後ろで誰かが言う
Behind your back, someone says,

537
00:45:33,372 --> 00:45:35,872
虎の威を借るキツネの群れに
to the pack of foxes borrowing the tiger's authority...

538
00:45:35,872 --> 00:45:38,272
ねぇ君は
Hey, you...

539
00:45:38,272 --> 00:45:41,572
一人で泣いてたんだね
You were crying all alone, weren't you?

540
00:45:46,272 --> 00:45:48,472
聴こえる？
Can you hear it?

541
00:45:48,472 --> 00:45:50,572
この声
This voice.

542
00:45:50,572 --> 00:45:53,372
あたしがその誹謗を
I will take those slanders...

543
00:45:53,372 --> 00:45:56,272
かき消すから
...and drown them out.

544
00:45:56,272 --> 00:45:59,272
わかってる 本当は
I know. The truth is...

545
00:45:59,272 --> 00:46:06,072
君が誰より優しいってことを
...that you are kinder than anyone else.

546
00:46:06,072 --> 00:46:08,472
ガラクタの声はそして歌った
And then the junk voice sang,

547
00:46:08,472 --> 00:46:11,472
他の誰でもない君のために
not for anyone else, but for you.

548
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:14,372
軋んでいく
Creaking along,

549
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:16,472
限界を超えて
beyond the limits.

550
00:46:16,472 --> 00:46:21,072
二人はどんなにたくさんの言葉を思いついたことだろう
I wonder how many words the two of us came up with.

551
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:23,872
だけど今は何ひとつ思いつかなくて
But now I can't think of a single thing,

552
00:46:23,872 --> 00:46:26,272
だけど何もかもわかった
yet I understood everything.

553
00:46:26,272 --> 00:46:29,572
「そうか、きっとこれは夢だ。」
"I see, this must be a dream."

554
00:46:29,572 --> 00:46:32,472
永遠に覚めない
A dream I'll never wake up from,

555
00:46:32,472 --> 00:46:36,472
君と会えた、そんな夢
the dream of meeting you.

556
00:46:40,872 --> 00:46:46,372
ガラクタは幸せそうな表情をしたまま
With the junk still wearing a happy expression,

557
00:46:46,372 --> 00:46:50,472
どれだけ呼んでももう動かない
no matter how much you call, it no longer moves.

558
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:53,272
望んだはずの結末に
At the ending you must have wanted,

559
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:55,872
君は泣き叫ぶ
you cry out.

560
00:46:55,872 --> 00:46:58,572
「嘘だろ、嘘だろ」って
Crying out, "It's a lie, right? It's a lie!"

561
00:46:58,572 --> 00:47:00,672
そう泣き叫ぶ
Cry out just like that.

562
00:47:06,372 --> 00:47:08,572
「僕は
"I am...

563
00:47:08,572 --> 00:47:11,572
無力だ。ガラクタ
...powerless. Even one piece...

564
00:47:11,572 --> 00:47:16,272
一つだって救えやしない」
...of junk, I cannot save."

565
00:47:16,272 --> 00:47:19,472
想いは 涙に
Thoughts... in tears,

566
00:47:19,472 --> 00:47:22,372
ぽつりぽつりと
drip by drip,

567
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:26,372
その頬を濡らす
wetting those cheeks.

568
00:47:26,372 --> 00:47:29,272
その時 世界は
In that moment, the world...

569
00:47:29,272 --> 00:47:33,472
途端にその色を
...suddenly its colors...

570
00:47:33,472 --> 00:47:36,272
大きく変える
...greatly changed.

571
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:38,672
悲しみ 喜び
Sadness, joy,

572
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:41,372
全てを一人と
everything, with one person...

573
00:47:41,372 --> 00:47:46,472
ひとつが知った
...and one piece, became known.

574
00:47:46,472 --> 00:47:49,072
言葉は歌になりこの世界を
Words become a song and travel the world...

575
00:47:49,072 --> 00:47:51,572
再び駆け巡る君のために
...once more, for you.

576
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:55,372
その声に意志を宿して
Imbuing that voice with will,

577
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:59,272
今 想いが響く
now, thoughts resonate.

さあ 散らばってしまった話を
Now, a story that has scattered...

580
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:09,572
空に手を伸ばし始める
I begin to reach my hands towards the sky.

581
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:17,572
下を通り過ぎる曲がった線に
To the curved lines passing below,

582
00:49:17,572 --> 00:49:24,572
縛られた足をくすぐるの
tickling my bound feet.

583
00:49:24,572 --> 00:49:32,372
嗚呼 落ちて汚れた意識を
Ah, the consciousness that fell and became stained,

584
00:49:32,372 --> 00:49:40,272
名前と呪術にかけて
casting names and sorcery.

585
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:47,872
空っぽだった体の
Of the body that was empty,

586
00:49:47,872 --> 00:49:54,872
夢見ていたまぶたが開く
the eyelids that were dreaming open.

587
00:49:54,872 --> 00:50:00,072
心の奥からうごめく記憶...
Memories wriggling from deep within the heart...

588
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,380
ゆらゆら
Swaying...

589
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,480
混じった呪いと祝福が
The mixed curse and blessing...

590
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,280
目の前を
...before my eyes...

591
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,580
知ってるの？
Do you know?

592
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,280
始まりと終わりに 向かって
Towards the beginning and the end...

593
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,480
果てに、帰ってくるのは
...what comes back in the end is...

594
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:23,780
パパの呼び声だけ
...only Papa's calling voice.

595
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,480
嗚呼、パパ、
Ah, Papa...

596
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,480
そこに居たら教えて欲しいの
If you are there, I want you to tell me...

597
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:35,780
私が歩くこの道は
...this path that I walk...

598
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:43,080
どんな色だろう
...what color will it be?

599
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:58,580
さあ、この調べの旋律を
Now, this melody of investigation...

600
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:06,480
空に手を伸ばし始める
...start reaching out to the sky...

601
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:13,580
散らばった 遠くの地のいろ
The scattered colors of distant lands...

602
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:21,580
愛を渇望して 泣き叫んでる
...crying out, thirsting for love.

603
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:03,280
始まりと終わりに 向かって
Towards the beginning and the end...

604
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,480
果てに、帰ってくるのは
...what comes back in the end is...

605
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:14,580
救われなかった君の声
...your voice that was not saved.

606
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,480
愛しい妹よ
My beloved sister...

607
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:23,180
そこに居たら教えて
If you are there, tell me...

608
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:27,580
君の手をいつかまた
Will I be able to hold your hand...

609
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:34,580
握れるのかな
...again someday?

610
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:01,030
Hello everyone! I hope you guys enjoyed the live.

611
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:06,360
And now that the live is over, I got some announcements for you guys. Wow!

612
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:12,880
Well first of all, it is the merch announcement. Woo!

613
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:19,500
This time around, I'm gonna be doing a Re-Released Edition Fashion Special. Wow!

614
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:25,540
You see some familiar and most requested items you guys kind of told me about.

615
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:31,500
So we're going to be releasing the TAKOD.EX Hoodie Re-Released Edition...

616
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:37,480
...and "Not-A-Bad-End" T-Shirt Re-Released Edition, a matching T-shirt with Ina!

617
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:43,660
And of course, when you have clothes, you gotta have a nice way to wash those clothes...

618
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:49,700
...so I'm also gonna be releasing "They-said-I-could-become-anything" Tako Mesh Laundry Pouch Re-Released Edition. Wow!

619
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:54,680
So all of these items are re-released, which means that they're gonna have a different tag...

620
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:59,080
...from their original, you know, released versions.

621
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:04,300
And these items are just a reproduction of the premium talent merch released in the past...

622
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:10,080
...and will have the special 2024 re-released edition label as the proof.

623
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,800
And up next, we got LINE stamps!

624
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:19,580
This is an official stamp pack that's gonna be released right after this live, wow, this stream, yes. Soon, very soon.

625
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:25,120
And it's drawn by none other than yours truly, Ninomae Ina'nis.

626
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:31,540
Honestly, I've always wanted like an easy to use stamp pack and I use LINE a lot...

627
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:37,020
...so I thought, you know, I'll take this chance to draw a whole set myself.

628
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:41,520
I hope you guys like it and I guess if you use LINE a bit, I hope you guys check it out.

629
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:46,480
I think they turned out pretty good, so...
