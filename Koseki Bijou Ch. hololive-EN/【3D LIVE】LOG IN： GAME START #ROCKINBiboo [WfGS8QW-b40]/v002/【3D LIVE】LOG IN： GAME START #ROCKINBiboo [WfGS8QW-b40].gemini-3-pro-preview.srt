00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,500
Let's have a game!

4
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,800

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,800
Hahahaha!

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,200
Huh?

10
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,000
Hah! Hah!

11
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,500
Mmm...

12
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,000
What the?!

13
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,500
Ah! Ah!

14
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,800
Ahhhhh!

15
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,100
Ah!

16
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,800
Oww... Ugh...

17
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,500
Ah... Ah...

18
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,000
Dang it!

19
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,500
Ugh...

20
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,500
Ah...

21
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,800
Uh, what's going on?

22
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,500
Where... Where am I?

23
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,800
Eh?

24
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,000
No way!

25
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,800
Did I get sucked into the game world?

26
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Woah... Wha...

27
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,500
What do I do?

28
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Hello?

29
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Hello?

30
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,500
Oh.

31
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,500
Why are there so many eyes on me?

32
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,500
H-Hello?

33
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,000
Hello?

34
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,000
They're not saying anything.

35
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh...

36
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,800
I have to get back.

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Today is such an important day,

38
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,500
I can't get stuck in here!

39
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
Ugh, what should I do?

40
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,500
I guess I have to... figure this out on my own. Um...

41
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,500
Well...

42
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,500
There's so many people looking at me.

43
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,500
Are those Pebbles? Hello?

44
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Are you expecting me to do something?

45
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,000
Maybe I should... sing and dance?

46
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,500
'Cause this looks like a stage.

47
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,500
Maybe...

48
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:03,158
Okay, I got it then.

49
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,708
I'm gonna sing and dance a song right now!

50
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:07,508
Here we go!

51
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,108

Yeah! How was that?

99

That was the best performance ever, right?

100
00:10:09,616 --> 00:10:11,766
Hey, over there! You liked it, right?

101
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,216
Hey!

102
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:17,916
With this, I should be able to get back to my own world.

103
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,016
Alright everybody! Beam me up, Pebbles!

104
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:24,416
Ah! Uh! Ahhh!

105
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:26,516
Why is it shaking?!

Yeahhh!

107
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,016
No!

108

Where are you going?!

109
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:36,016
Dang it.

110
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:38,816
Well, according to video game logic...

111
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:43,016
...this must mean I must now go on an epic quest to find the coins or something.

112
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:44,916
But I don't have time for that!

113
00:10:45,316 --> 00:10:47,516
I need the coins back to get home! No!

114
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,016
Huh?

115
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:52,916
Oh, what's this?

116
00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:57,816
Uh, I mean, I came out through there, so...

117
00:10:58,216 --> 00:11:02,516
Maybe this will take me, you know, on my next step of my quest?

118
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,216
Well, better than being stuck here. So...

119
00:11:08,516 --> 00:11:10,516
Let's go!

120
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:24,016
Ahhh!

121
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:29,016
Huh? I'm not back in my world?

122
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:32,116
え？ここどこ？
Eh? Where am I?

123
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,016

Ah! Coin! The Coin!

129
00:11:53,316 --> 00:11:56,516
これがないと元の世界に戻れないんでしょ？
You can't return to your world without this, right?

130
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,716
でもそうはさせない。
But I won't let you.

From us, the Game Masters...

00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:08,516
え？ほんと？帰れるの？あれ？え？あ？
Eh? Really? I can go home? Huh? Eh? Ah?

134
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:12,716

僕と... 勝負だ！
...battle me!

136
00:12:16,216 --> 00:12:17,516

00:43:25,183 --> 00:43:27,683
これが欲しければ...
If you want this...

652
00:43:28,183 --> 00:43:29,983
我々と勝負だ！
Then duel us!

653
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:31,183
My coin!

654
00:43:31,183 --> 00:43:32,383
勝負だ！
It's a duel!

655
00:43:32,383 --> 00:43:37,183
迫りくるゾンビを... 全部... 倒すことが...
Can you... defeat... all... the approaching zombies...

656
00:43:37,183 --> 00:43:39,683
できるかな！？
I wonder!?

657
00:43:41,683 --> 00:43:43,183
Oh... Well...

658
00:43:43,183 --> 00:43:47,183
じゃあ、容赦は... しない！
Then, I won't... show mercy!

659
00:43:53,683 --> 00:43:56,183
Run away, run away, run away you

660
00:43:56,183 --> 00:44:00,183
Gonna put the pedal down

661
00:44:00,183 --> 00:44:03,683
Nowhere to go, nowhere to go, nowhere to go

662
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:06,683
No road is left to run

663
00:44:06,683 --> 00:44:10,183
I was born, I was born with horns

664
00:44:10,183 --> 00:44:13,683
Demons couldn't shake me up

665
00:44:13,683 --> 00:44:17,183
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on

666
00:44:17,183 --> 00:44:20,683
'Cause we haven't had enough

667
00:44:21,183 --> 00:44:24,183
Don't give up the fight

668
00:44:28,183 --> 00:44:31,183
Make it out alive

669
00:44:33,683 --> 00:44:36,683
Sip this bottle, wine or blood

670
00:44:40,183 --> 00:44:44,183
Don't give up, it's gonna be alright

671
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:50,183
'Cause I won't let you go

672
00:44:54,183 --> 00:44:58,683
We're gonna make it out alive

673
00:45:00,804 --> 00:45:02,304
Tonight, tonight, tonight I'm

674
00:45:02,304 --> 00:45:05,604
Screaming on the inside

675
00:45:05,604 --> 00:45:09,304
I was trying to hide, trying to hide, trying to hide now

676
00:45:09,304 --> 00:45:12,004
Ready for this ride

677
00:45:13,404 --> 00:45:14,804
Gotta face, gotta face

678
00:45:14,804 --> 00:45:19,604
the unknown if it's the only way to live

679
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:23,404
I'm ready to go, ready to go, ready to go

680
00:45:23,404 --> 00:45:26,704
somewhere that I've never been

681
00:45:26,704 --> 00:45:33,404
Won't give up the fight

682
00:45:33,604 --> 00:45:38,404
Make it out alive

683
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:44,404
Set this world on fire now, whoa, whoa

684
00:45:46,404 --> 00:45:52,804
Don't give up, it's gonna be alright

685
00:45:53,004 --> 00:45:58,404
'Cause I won't let you burn out, whoa, whoa

686
00:45:59,404 --> 00:46:04,004
We're gonna make it out alive

687
00:46:34,004 --> 00:46:38,804
Make it out alive

688
00:46:39,304 --> 00:46:45,604
Set this world on fire now, whoa, whoa

689
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:53,004
Don't give up, it's gonna be alright

690
00:46:53,004 --> 00:46:58,404
'Cause I won't let you burn out, whoa, whoa

691
00:46:59,404 --> 00:47:04,604
We're gonna make it out alive

692
00:47:04,804 --> 00:47:06,804
Yeah, yeah, yeah

693
00:47:07,004 --> 00:47:11,404
We're gonna make it out alive

694
00:47:11,604 --> 00:47:14,004
Yeah! Make it out! Make it out!

695
00:47:14,304 --> 00:47:18,004
We're gonna make it out alive

696
00:47:22,604 --> 00:47:24,904
全部倒すなんてすげーじゃん！
Defeating them all is amazing!

697
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:26,504
あ、終わった？
Oh, is it over?

698
00:47:26,704 --> 00:47:28,204
勝負あり！よし！
Game over! Alright!

699
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:29,604
コインをやろう。
I'll give you a coin.

700
00:47:30,004 --> 00:47:31,104
お！コイン！
Oh! A coin!

701
00:47:31,404 --> 00:47:35,004
やったー！
Yay!

702
00:47:36,304 --> 00:47:38,404
じゃあ、みんなありがとうね。
Well, thanks everyone.

703
00:47:39,704 --> 00:47:41,004
Happy birthday.

704
00:47:41,404 --> 00:47:42,304
What's happy birthday mean?

705
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:44,404
ありがとうございます！
Thank you very much!

706
00:47:45,004 --> 00:47:45,804
Okay.

707
00:47:46,604 --> 00:47:48,204
じゃあ、さよなら！
Well, bye!

708
00:47:52,604 --> 00:47:54,604
くそ！なんでできない！？
Damn! Why couldn't I do it?!

709
00:48:08,704 --> 00:48:12,004
Oh... Nice landing, yeah.

710
00:48:14,404 --> 00:48:17,004
Huh? Oh, it's the first stage.

711
00:48:17,704 --> 00:48:21,104
Maybe this is like a... a progress check sort of thing.

712
00:48:22,304 --> 00:48:24,604
Let's see... let's see where I'm at, huh?

713
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:29,004
Oh! I'm missing one more coin!

714
00:48:30,004 --> 00:48:31,604
But... where could it be?

715
00:48:33,404 --> 00:48:36,304
Is anyone here to give me another game or something?

716
00:48:36,704 --> 00:48:39,304
Hello? Hello?

717
00:48:40,704 --> 00:48:45,204
Maybe this is like the safe zone where I can like take a break and recover.

718
00:48:46,304 --> 00:48:48,004
That's a good idea. You know...

719
00:48:48,704 --> 00:48:53,004
I'm feeling kind of tired and all the songs have been so Biboo-ing intense.

720
00:48:55,404 --> 00:48:58,404
Let's take a break. Just a nap. I'll wake up.

721
00:49:02,304 --> 00:49:06,004
Hold on everyone. Just give me like 5 minutes, okay? Just 5 minutes.

722
00:49:06,704 --> 00:49:08,704
Oyasumi, you know. Oyasumi.
Goodnight, you know. Goodnight.

723
00:49:08,804 --> 00:49:10,704
See ya see ya.

724
00:49:47,004 --> 00:49:52,704
Well come and well met, my brave little spark

725
00:49:53,404 --> 00:49:58,704
How long you've wandered, burned bright as a star

726
00:50:00,825 --> 00:50:05,325
Oh, I have awaited you patiently all this time

727
00:50:06,825 --> 00:50:09,725
Past every fate

728
00:50:10,725 --> 00:50:14,525
Now sing with me once more,

729
00:50:14,525 --> 00:50:17,525
share of your life

730
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:23,225
Far greater than memory,

731
00:50:23,225 --> 00:50:27,725
its loss and love words cannot hold

732
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:33,625
Boundless the tale overflows

733
00:50:35,525 --> 00:50:40,725
And carries your light out to sea

734
00:50:47,025 --> 00:50:52,225
Remember the rain, near and far beloved

735
00:50:53,025 --> 00:50:58,425
Each drop a blessing from heavens above

736
00:50:59,425 --> 00:51:05,925
And how as time flowed on those waters became one

737
00:51:07,325 --> 00:51:10,725
Streams, rivers and lakes

738
00:51:11,225 --> 00:51:17,725
Reaching for the horizon and far beyond

739
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:23,725
They carry onward however changed

740
00:51:23,725 --> 00:51:26,725
with each brief reflection,

741
00:51:26,725 --> 00:51:29,825
by setting sun

742
00:51:30,525 --> 00:51:34,425
By storm's wake

743
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:42,725
Til welcomed home to gentle sea

744
00:51:47,525 --> 00:51:52,425
Sinking deeper and deeper in calm embrace

745
00:51:53,225 --> 00:51:58,125
Loving tides sweep in and bear you down

746
00:51:58,925 --> 00:52:04,325
Should you meet a soul rising surface-ways

747
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:09,825
With your unbeatng heart, wish them well

748
00:52:14,925 --> 00:52:18,725
Deep, dark, far away,

749
00:52:19,225 --> 00:52:23,825
I have heard your voice, weighed your every choice

750
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:31,725
Now our hands join round the meaning you sought

751
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:35,625
I'll catch your tears,

752
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:42,725
quench your fears with joy til you near the shore

753
00:52:43,225 --> 00:52:49,225
Where in time, all shall as hope be reborn,

754
00:52:49,225 --> 00:52:51,725
all...

755
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:17,025
Hush love, close your eyes, and in sleep abide

756
00:53:18,925 --> 00:53:23,725
As sun's distant light echoes down to dreams below

757
00:53:29,525 --> 00:53:36,325
Know you will wake, on winds rise again

758
00:53:37,225 --> 00:53:41,425
For this journey's end is but one step forward

759
00:53:41,425 --> 00:53:46,225
to tomorrow

760
00:54:47,525 --> 00:54:49,325
Wah, what a good dream.

761
00:54:49,725 --> 00:54:52,425
Huuh. All right, let's check our progress then.

762
00:54:52,725 --> 00:54:55,425
Umm, we're still missing one coin.

763
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,225
Where could it be?

764
00:55:03,646 --> 00:55:04,446
Ah! Again?

765
00:55:05,346 --> 00:55:08,746
What's happening?

766
00:55:12,346 --> 00:55:15,746
What the beep!?

767
00:55:17,546 --> 00:55:20,746
I've been waiting for you, Biboo.

768
00:55:25,346 --> 00:55:26,746
You... You're...

769
00:55:27,746 --> 00:55:28,746
I'm you.

770
00:55:29,146 --> 00:55:29,746
Me?

771
00:55:30,746 --> 00:55:33,646
You mean... my last opponent is me?

772
00:55:33,846 --> 00:55:35,646
Exactly. Me.

773
00:55:36,946 --> 00:55:37,546
You.

774
00:55:38,446 --> 00:55:40,146
Your biggest enemy.

775
00:55:40,646 --> 00:55:42,046
Your biggest obstacle.

776
00:55:42,846 --> 00:55:43,846
Yourself.

777
00:55:44,446 --> 00:55:45,546
No...

778
00:55:45,946 --> 00:55:48,746
You've done well at making it this far, Biboo.

779
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:51,746
But I don't intend to hold back.

780
00:55:52,546 --> 00:55:53,846
Then, I won't either.

781
00:55:53,946 --> 00:55:57,046
This stage is too important for me to give up now!

782
00:56:25,746 --> 00:56:28,446
I feel like I'm losing hope

783
00:56:28,946 --> 00:56:31,746
In my body and my soul

784
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,446
And the sky,

785
00:56:34,646 --> 00:56:36,746
It looks so ominous

786
00:56:39,046 --> 00:56:41,646
And as time comes to a halt

787
00:56:42,146 --> 00:56:45,046
Silence starts to overflow

788
00:56:45,146 --> 00:56:47,546
My cries

789
00:56:47,646 --> 00:56:49,646
Are inconspicuous

790
00:56:51,246 --> 00:56:52,646
Tell me God,

791
00:56:54,246 --> 00:56:56,646
Are you punishing me?

792
00:56:57,846 --> 00:57:02,746
Is this the price I'm paying for my past mistakes?

793
00:57:04,446 --> 00:57:05,346
This

794
00:57:06,046 --> 00:57:08,946
Is my redemption song

795
00:57:11,046 --> 00:57:15,246
I need you more than ever right now

796
00:57:17,046 --> 00:57:19,046
Can you hear me now?

797
00:57:20,846 --> 00:57:23,246
Cause we're gonna shout it loud

798
00:57:23,846 --> 00:57:26,046
Even if our words seem meaningless

799
00:57:26,946 --> 00:57:31,246
It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world

800
00:57:33,646 --> 00:57:36,646
I wish that somehow, somehow

801
00:57:37,146 --> 00:57:39,346
That I could save every one of us

802
00:57:40,146 --> 00:57:44,446
But the truth is that I'm only one girl

803
00:57:46,646 --> 00:57:49,046
Maybe if I keep believing

804
00:57:49,146 --> 00:57:53,246
My dreams will come to life

805
00:57:55,546 --> 00:57:57,646
Come to life

806
00:58:12,946 --> 00:58:14,646
暴れる祈り
A rampage of prayer

807
00:58:16,146 --> 00:58:17,846
零れる命
Crumbling life

808
00:58:18,946 --> 00:58:19,646
風は
The wind is...

809
00:58:21,246 --> 00:58:23,646
今も遠く
...still far away

810
00:58:26,046 --> 00:58:27,946
剥がれる錆と
With peeling rust

811
00:58:29,146 --> 00:58:31,146
蠢く刃
And wriggling blades

812
00:58:32,046 --> 00:58:32,846
死が
In the forest...

813
00:58:34,346 --> 00:58:36,646
潜む森に
...where death lurks

814
00:58:37,946 --> 00:58:39,446
これが僕...
This is my...

815
00:58:39,846 --> 00:58:42,746
...僕の呪い
...my curse

816
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:49,946
約束殺す痛みが
The pain that kills the promise

817
00:58:51,546 --> 00:58:52,446
キミ...
Your...

818
00:58:53,046 --> 00:58:56,046
...の願い
...wish

819
00:58:58,146 --> 00:59:02,346
最後の夢を捨てて
Discarding the final dream

820
00:59:04,146 --> 00:59:06,246
償いだけど
It is an atonement, but

821
00:59:07,946 --> 00:59:10,346
そう僕らは今
Yes, we are now

822
00:59:10,946 --> 00:59:13,146
無意味でも叫ぶ
Shouting even if it's meaningless

823
00:59:14,046 --> 00:59:18,246
この汚れた世界の愛
The love of this corrupted world

824
00:59:20,746 --> 00:59:23,146
そう僕らは今
Yes, we are now

825
00:59:24,246 --> 00:59:26,346
無意味でも願う
Wishing even if it's meaningless

826
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:31,446
ただキミとの時間を
For just a moment with you

827
00:59:33,546 --> 00:59:36,046
溺れた意識は
My drowning consciousness

828
00:59:36,646 --> 00:59:39,646
優しいまま
Remains gentle

829
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:45,546
消えて
As it fades away

830
01:00:15,367 --> 01:00:18,667
Cause we're gonna shout it loud

831
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:22,067
Even if our words seem meaningless

832
01:00:22,067 --> 01:00:26,067
It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world

833
01:00:28,367 --> 01:00:31,517
そう僕らは今

ただキミとの未来を
Just wishing for a future with you.

836
01:00:41,317 --> 01:00:44,467
Still, we're gonna shout it loud

837
01:00:44,467 --> 01:00:47,567
Even if our words seem meaningless

838
01:00:47,567 --> 01:00:51,767
It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world

839
01:00:54,267 --> 01:00:57,167

843
01:01:10,467 --> 01:01:14,567
My dreams will come to life

844

Oh, you're still alive. Oh.

849
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:05,267
You who have defeated all the game masters shall be rewarded.

850
01:02:06,067 --> 01:02:09,367
Huh? Wha- What is this?

851
01:02:10,567 --> 01:02:12,967

Hello everyone! We have made it to the final stage!

857
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,567
You didn't think I collected all those coins...

858
01:02:45,567 --> 01:02:48,567
...and played all those games for nothing, did you?

859
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:53,567
No, because I'm cashing it in! With all of these coins we have unlocked...

860
01:02:54,867 --> 01:02:57,467
My new original song! Woohoo!

861
01:02:58,967 --> 01:03:00,867
And guess what?

Woke up in the morning,

870
01:03:31,117 --> 01:03:33,117
I had a funny dream.

871
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:36,467
I was a stone that had been thrown

872
01:03:36,467 --> 01:03:39,067
no way back, I was all in.

873
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:42,767
What if that was me soaring straight to the top?

874
01:03:43,067 --> 01:03:45,067
