What the biboo?!

4
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,820
Dang it!

5
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,840
Oh Bijou...

6
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,020
Oh, what's going on?

7
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,420
Where... Where am I?

8
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,820
No way! Did I get sucked into the game world?

9
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,280
Whoa... What do I do?

10
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,550
Hello? Hello?

11
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,420
Oh, why are there so many eyes on me?

12
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,250
Hello? Hello?

13
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,100
They're not saying anything.

14
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,420
Oh, I have to get back!

15
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,450
Today is such an important day! I can't get stuck in here!

16
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,920
Ugh, what should I do?

17
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,380
I guess I have to figure this out on my own.

18
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,850
There's so many people looking at me...

19
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,620
...are those Pebbles? Hello?

20
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,680
Are you expecting me to do something?

21
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,250
Maybe I should sing and dance? Because this looks like a stage.

22
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,000
Maybe...

23
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,363
Wait, how'd I get out? Okay.

24
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:03,363
Okay, I got it then.

25
00:05:03,463 --> 00:05:05,508
I'm gonna sing and dance a song right now!

26
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:07,008
Here we go!

74
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:09,098
That was the best performance ever, right?

75
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:11,133
Hey over there!

76
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:14,370
You liked it, right? Hey!

77
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,673
With this, I should be able to get back to my own world.

78
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:21,110
Alright, ready? Beam me up, pebbles!

79
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:24,016
Ah! Ah!

Guys, where are you going?

83
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,816
Dang it.

84
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:38,266
Well, according to video game logic,

85
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:43,016
this must mean I must now go on an epic quest to find the coins or something.

86
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:45,616
But I don't have time for that!

87
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,816
I need the coins back to get home! No!

88
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:54,016
Huh? Huh? Oh, what's this?

89
00:10:54,316 --> 00:10:58,016
I mean, I came out through there, so

90
00:10:58,216 --> 00:11:03,016
maybe this will take me... you know, on my next step of my quest?

91
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:07,016
Well, better than being stuck here. So...

92
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,516
Let's go!

93
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:30,016
Huh? Huh? I'm not back in my world? Eh?

94
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,516

これがないと元の世界に戻れないんでしょ？
Without this, you can't get back to your world, right?

102
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,916
でも、そうはさせない。
But I won't let that happen.

00:12:01,016 --> 00:12:03,816
すべて取り戻せるかな？
...can you take them all back?

105
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:08,516
Wait, really? Can I not go back... wait...

106
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:13,016
とにかく！このコインが欲しければ、僕と勝負だ！
Anyway! If you want this coin, challenge me!

そう！ Yes！ 格闘ゲームで勝負だ！
So! Yes! Let's settle this with a fighting game!

00:47:54,819 --> 00:47:57,019
くそ、立てない...
Damn, I can't stand up...

634
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:12,819
Ugh... nice landing, yeah.

635
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:14,719
Huh?

636
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:17,639
Oh, it's the first stage.

637
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:20,719
Maybe this is like a progress check sort of thing?

638
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:23,439
Let's see, let's see where I'm at.

639
00:48:24,219 --> 00:48:26,745
Huh? Oh!

640
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:30,369
I'm missing one more coin! But...

641
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:32,669
...where could it be?

642
00:48:33,219 --> 00:48:36,745
Is anyone here to give me another game or something?

643
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:45,719
Maybe this is like the safe zone where I can

644
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:47,669
like take a break and recover.

645
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:50,369
That's a good idea. You know,

646
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:53,519
I'm feeling kind of tired,

647
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:56,719
and all these songs have been so beep-beep intense.

648
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:59,252
Let's- let's take a break. I'll just a nap.

649
00:48:59,252 --> 00:49:02,469
I'll- I'll wake up. Just... hold on everyone.

650
00:49:02,469 --> 00:49:05,319
Just- just give me like five minutes, okay?

651
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:07,369
Just five minutes. Oyasumi-hello!
Just five minutes. Good night-hello!

652
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:10,719
You know, oyasumi-ya, oyasumi-ya.
You know, good night, good night.

653
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:17,719
Flow

654
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:22,719
Lyrics: Kathryn Cwynar, Natsuko Ishikawa

655
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:52,752
Well come and well met, my brave little spark.

656
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:59,469
How long you've wandered, burned bright as a star.

657
00:50:00,425 --> 00:50:06,725
Oh, I have awaited you patiently all this time

658
00:50:08,225 --> 00:50:10,725
Past every fate

659
00:50:11,025 --> 00:50:18,225
Now sing with me once more, share of your life

660
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:23,725
Far greater than memory,

661
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:27,725
its loss and love words cannot hold

662
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:35,225
Boundless the tale overflows

663
00:50:35,725 --> 00:50:44,725
And carries your light out to sea

664
00:50:46,725 --> 00:50:52,725
Remember the rain, near and far beloved

665
00:50:53,225 --> 00:50:58,725
Each drop a blessing from heavens above

666
00:50:59,225 --> 00:51:07,725
And how as time flowed on those waters became one

667
00:51:08,225 --> 00:51:10,725
Streams, rivers and lakes

668
00:51:11,025 --> 00:51:18,725
Reaching for the horizon and far beyond

669
00:51:19,225 --> 00:51:24,725
They carry onward however changed

670
00:51:24,825 --> 00:51:29,725
with each brief reflection, by setting sun

671
00:51:30,225 --> 00:51:35,225
By storms wake

672
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:46,225
Til welcomed home to gentle sea

673
00:51:46,725 --> 00:51:52,725
Sinking deeper and deeper in calm embrace

674
00:51:53,225 --> 00:51:58,725
Loving tides sweep in and bear you down

675
00:51:59,225 --> 00:52:04,725
Should you meet a soul rising surfacewards

676
00:52:05,225 --> 00:52:12,725
With your unbeating heart wish them well

677
00:52:14,725 --> 00:52:18,725
Deep, dark, far away,

678
00:52:19,225 --> 00:52:24,725
I have heard your voice, weighed your every choice

679
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:32,725
Now our hands join round the meaning you sought

680
00:52:33,225 --> 00:52:38,725
I'll catch your tears, quench your fears

681
00:52:39,225 --> 00:52:43,725
With joy til you're near the shore

682
00:52:44,225 --> 00:52:53,725
Where in time, all shall as hope be reborn, and

683
00:53:10,725 --> 00:53:19,725
Hush love, close your eyes, and in sleep abide

684
00:53:20,225 --> 00:53:24,725
As sun's distant light

685
00:53:24,825 --> 00:53:29,225
echoes down to dreams below

686
00:53:29,725 --> 00:53:36,725
Know you will wake, on winds rise again

687
00:53:37,225 --> 00:53:42,725
For this journey's end is but one step

688
00:53:42,825 --> 00:53:49,225
forward to tomorrow

689
00:54:45,725 --> 00:54:47,225
ううう……
Uuuh...

690
00:54:47,725 --> 00:54:51,725
うわぁ！ いい夢だった。
Whoa! What a good dream.

691
00:54:52,725 --> 00:54:54,225
はぁ。
Haaah.

692
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:56,725
よし、それじゃあ進捗を確認しよう。
Alright, let's check our progress then.

693
00:54:56,825 --> 00:54:58,725
うーん、まだコインが1枚足りないな。
Ummm, we're still missing one coin.

694
00:54:58,825 --> 00:55:00,225
どこにあるんだろう？
Where could it be?

695
00:55:01,446 --> 00:55:02,246
Eh? Ah!

696
00:55:02,346 --> 00:55:08,746
Ah! Again! What's happening?!

697
00:55:15,246 --> 00:55:17,246
What the Beep?

698
00:55:17,746 --> 00:55:21,246
I've been waiting for you, Bijou.

699
00:55:21,746 --> 00:55:24,246
Fake Biboo Joins the Battle!

700
00:55:24,746 --> 00:55:27,246
You... you're...

701
00:55:27,746 --> 00:55:28,746
I'm you.

702
00:55:28,846 --> 00:55:30,246
Me?

703
00:55:30,346 --> 00:55:33,246
You mean... my last opponent is me?

704
00:55:33,346 --> 00:55:34,746
Exactly.

705
00:55:35,246 --> 00:55:36,746
Me. You.

706
00:55:36,846 --> 00:55:39,246
Your biggest enemy.

707
00:55:39,346 --> 00:55:41,746
Your biggest obstacle.

708
00:55:41,846 --> 00:55:43,246
Yourself.

709
00:55:43,346 --> 00:55:44,746
No...

710
00:55:45,246 --> 00:55:49,246
You've done well at making it this far, Bijou.

711
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,746
But I don't intend to hold back.

712
00:55:52,246 --> 00:55:53,746
Then I won't either!

713
00:55:53,846 --> 00:55:56,746
This stage is too important for me to give up now!

714
00:55:58,746 --> 00:56:03,246
Weight of the World / 壊レタ世界ノ歌
Weight of the World / Song of the Broken World

715
00:56:25,746 --> 00:56:28,246
I feel like I'm losing hope

716
00:56:28,346 --> 00:56:31,246
In my body and my soul

717
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:34,246
And the sky,

718
00:56:34,346 --> 00:56:37,246
it looks so ominous

719
00:56:38,746 --> 00:56:41,246
And as time comes to a halt

720
00:56:41,346 --> 00:56:44,246
Silence starts to overflow

721
00:56:44,346 --> 00:56:47,246
My cries

722
00:56:47,346 --> 00:56:50,246
are inconspicuous

723
00:56:50,346 --> 00:56:53,246
Tell me God,

724
00:56:53,346 --> 00:56:57,246
are you punishing me?

725
00:56:57,346 --> 00:57:01,246
Is this the price I'm paying

726
00:57:01,346 --> 00:57:04,246
for my past mistakes?

727
00:57:04,346 --> 00:57:06,246
This

728
00:57:06,346 --> 00:57:09,746
is my redemption song

729
00:57:10,746 --> 00:57:14,746
I need you more than ever right now

730
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:19,746
Can you hear me now?

731
00:57:20,746 --> 00:57:23,246
Cause we're gonna shout it loud

732
00:57:23,346 --> 00:57:26,246
Even if our words seem meaningless

733
00:57:26,346 --> 00:57:30,246
It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world

734
00:57:32,746 --> 00:57:36,246
I wish that someway, somehow

735
00:57:36,346 --> 00:57:39,246
That I could save every one of us

736
00:57:39,346 --> 00:57:44,246
But the truth is that I'm only one girl

737
00:57:45,746 --> 00:57:48,246
Maybe if I keep believing

738
00:57:48,346 --> 00:57:53,246
My dreams will come to life

739
00:57:55,746 --> 00:57:59,246
Come to life

740
00:58:12,746 --> 00:58:15,246
溢れ出る色
Overflowing colors

741
00:58:15,346 --> 00:58:18,246
こぼれる命
Spilling life

742
00:58:18,346 --> 00:58:24,246
風は今も遠く
The wind is still far away

743
00:58:25,746 --> 00:58:28,246
剥がれる錆びと
Peeling rust and

744
00:58:28,346 --> 00:58:31,246
蠢めく刃
wriggling blades

745
00:58:31,346 --> 00:58:37,246
花がいつか森に
The flowers will one day become a forest

746
00:58:37,346 --> 00:58:43,246
これが僕の呪い
This is my curse

747
00:58:44,746 --> 00:58:50,246
約束殺す痛みが
The pain of killing a promise

748
00:58:51,746 --> 00:58:55,246
君の願い
Your wish

749
00:58:57,746 --> 00:59:03,246
最後の夢を捨てた
Discarded the last dream

750
00:59:03,346 --> 00:59:06,746
償いだけど
It's an atonement, but

751
00:59:07,746 --> 00:59:10,246
そう僕らは今
So we are now

752
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:13,246
無価値でも叫ぶ
Screaming even if it's worthless

753
00:59:13,346 --> 00:59:19,246
この汚れた世界の愛
The love of this stained world

754
00:59:20,746 --> 00:59:23,246
そう僕らは今
So we are now

755
00:59:23,346 --> 00:59:26,246
無意味でも願う
Wishing even if it's meaningless

756
00:59:26,346 --> 00:59:32,246
ただ君との時間を
Just the time with you

757
00:59:33,746 --> 00:59:42,246
溺れた意識は 優しいまま
The drowned consciousness remains gentle

758
00:59:42,346 --> 00:59:45,246
消えて
and disappears

759
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:05,267
Weight of the World / 壊レタ世界ノ歌
Weight of the World / Song of a Broken World

760
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:17,650
Cause we're gonna shout it loud

761
01:00:17,917 --> 01:00:21,117
Even if our words seem meaningless

762
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:27,467
It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world

763
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,650
そう僕らは今
So, here we are now

764
01:00:30,817 --> 01:00:34,017
無意味でも願う
Even if it's meaningless, we wish

765
01:00:34,217 --> 01:00:40,267
ただ君との未来を
Simply for a future with you

766
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:43,950
Still, we're gonna shout it loud

767
01:00:44,217 --> 01:00:47,317
Even if our words seem meaningless

768
01:00:47,417 --> 01:00:53,567
It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world

769
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,550

So, here we are now

ただ君との時間を祈り歌を
Simply for a moment with you, a prayer song

772
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:08,767
Maybe if I keep believing

773
01:01:08,967 --> 01:01:10,767
祈りが赦しを
Even if my prayers

774
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:12,067
得られずとも
cannot be forgiven

775
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:14,767
My dreams will come to life

776
01:01:17,067 --> 01:01:18,767
僕は...
I am...

777
01:01:50,367 --> 01:01:51,767
Impressive.

778
01:01:53,567 --> 01:01:54,667
Yes!

779
01:01:54,667 --> 01:01:55,767
The coin!

780
01:01:56,067 --> 01:01:57,867
Oh, you're so wide. Oh.

781
01:02:00,617 --> 01:02:05,917
You who have defeated all the game masters shall be rewarded.

782
01:02:06,567 --> 01:02:07,667
Huh?

783
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:08,867
What is this?

784
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:12,867
Now, show this to everyone.

785
01:02:13,267 --> 01:02:14,567
Yeah!

786
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:16,067
Hey, thanks! But um...

787
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,767
There can only be one.

788
01:02:19,267 --> 01:02:20,767
Ha!

789
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:37,267
Oh, oh, I'm here. Oh, oh.

790
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:42,067
Hello everyone! We have made it to the final stage!

791
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:47,767
You didn't think I collected all those coins and played all those games for nothing, did you?

792
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:53,267
No, because I'm cashing it in with all of these coins we have unlocked...

793
01:02:53,967 --> 01:02:58,267
My new original song! Woohoo!

794
01:02:58,467 --> 01:03:02,067
And guess what? The video is gonna come out right after this!

795
01:03:02,167 --> 01:03:03,767
Good job everyone!

796
01:03:03,967 --> 01:03:06,767
And I'm gonna perform it to you right now!

797
01:03:06,967 --> 01:03:08,567
Are you ready?

798
01:03:08,667 --> 01:03:10,167
Let's go out with a bang!

799
01:03:10,267 --> 01:03:12,767
ROCK IN!

800
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:18,267
ROCK IN!

801
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:20,567
Biboo's here to play

802
01:03:20,967 --> 01:03:23,167
Yeah, uh-huh

803
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:26,267
Uh-uh

804
01:03:27,667 --> 01:03:29,667
Woke up in the morning

805
01:03:29,767 --> 01:03:32,467
I had a funny dream

806
01:03:33,467 --> 01:03:35,967
I was a stone that had been thrown

807
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:38,467
No way back, I was all in

808
01:03:39,367 --> 01:03:42,367
What if that was me soaring straight to the top?

809
01:03:42,467 --> 01:03:45,567
Let's take a chance, game on, and shoot my shot
