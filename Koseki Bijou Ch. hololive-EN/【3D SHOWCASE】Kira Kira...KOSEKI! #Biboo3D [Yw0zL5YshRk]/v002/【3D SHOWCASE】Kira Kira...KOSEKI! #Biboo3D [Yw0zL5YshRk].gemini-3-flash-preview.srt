It's me, Biboo, the Moai.

What?

14
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,400
Is this not the Biboo you wanted to see?

15
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,000
Hmm...

16
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,300
Maybe if you say please, I'll come out.

17
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,900
Come on.

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,300

You're embarrassing me, feet!

Stop that!

68
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:55,408
Not on 3D! Oh, Biboo...

00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,408
Nnn... No!

00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,408
Bombijou-ai!

75
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:17,258
I'm Koseki Bijou, sparkling gem of Hololive English Advent...

76
00:08:17,258 --> 00:08:21,908
...and today, Biboo's in 3D! Yay!

77
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,458
Wow. But before we get to business...

78
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:36,408
#Biboo3D, #Biboo3D, #Biboo3D!

79
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:40,408
Please post any cute pictures or any, uh, reactions...

80
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:44,908
...to my cute 3D body, okay?

81
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:46,408
Yeah.

82
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:48,908
Tada! I'm in full power now!

83
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:52,908
Hehehe, nothing can limit me!

84
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,408
You've been waiting a long time, huh?

85
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:59,408
Huh? For me to make these cute poses...

86
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:05,408
...to make these cute wiggles? Hehehe!

87
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:07,908
Look at my body. Okay fine, feet.

88
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:10,408
That's what you wanted, right?

89
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:12,608
This?

90
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:14,408
Yeah, well, there you go.

91
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:16,908
Okay, well...

92
00:09:16,908 --> 00:09:20,408
What do you think? Do you like my place?

93
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:24,408
I actually left this place before I went to prison...

94
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:30,408
...so it looks a little different.

95
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:34,908
Yeah, it looks a little different now.

96
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:39,408
I guess no one took care of it while I was gone, but isn't it pretty?

97
00:09:39,408 --> 00:09:42,408
Look at all these crystals! I made those.

98
00:09:42,408 --> 00:09:44,908
I made those by the way. I made that one.

99
00:09:44,908 --> 00:09:47,208
And that one. And that one. And that one.

100
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,408
Yeah.

101
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:52,408
So here, take a look.

102
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:55,408
Ooh, there's some greenery over there.

103
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:58,208
There's a giant hole up there, and there, and there...

104
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,208
...but that's okay. There's a tree! Look at that tree.

105
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:05,108
Cute. Isn't it pretty?

106
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:09,986
Hehe, I like it so much. Hehehehe.

107
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:11,336
Pebbles!

108
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:13,486
Thank you for coming today.

109
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:17,386
I'm so excited to share with you
everything I have in store.

110
00:10:17,836 --> 00:10:19,686
But the first thing I sang,

111
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,386
did you recognize it?

112
00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:24,086
Obviously you didn't,
because that was my first...

113
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:26,486
...original song!

114
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:29,086
プリズムの魔法、
Prism Magic,

115
00:10:29,186 --> 00:10:31,536
or Prisma Magic.

116
00:10:31,686 --> 00:10:33,236
Did you like it?

117
00:10:33,286 --> 00:10:35,086
I'm very proud of it.

118
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:38,486
And I hope it made you
feel happy and magical.

119
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:40,036
Mhm, yeah.

120
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:42,586
Thank you so much for listening.

121
00:10:43,336 --> 00:10:47,486
And I'm so excited to show you
the rest of the 3D showcase.

122
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:50,286
Yay! Oh!

123
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:54,386
What's that?

124
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:55,186
Eh?

125
00:10:56,086 --> 00:10:57,286
Stairs?

126
00:11:00,136 --> 00:11:01,786
Whoa...

127
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:04,236
...where does that go?

128
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:07,386
It looks pretty deep.

129
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:09,086
Eh, what's that?

130
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:11,786
Eee-ooo-aaa!

131
00:11:39,236 --> 00:11:40,336
Dang it.

132
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:51,386
Ooooh... Ugh...

133
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:53,886
Ow, what was that?

134
00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:56,486
Ugh... Oh...

135
00:11:57,836 --> 00:11:58,436
Huh?

136
00:11:58,486 --> 00:11:59,386
Eh?

137
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:03,436
Where am I?

138
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:07,086
It's so dark in here. Hello?

139
00:12:07,386 --> 00:12:08,086
Huh?

140
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,186
Oh?

141
00:12:09,486 --> 00:12:12,186
Ooh! What's this?

142
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:16,586
A crystal? Oh, it's so shiny!

143
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,786
Oh? Boop-boop-boop.

144
00:12:19,186 --> 00:12:20,986
Ooh!

145
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:23,436
What is this for?

146
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,586
It looks magical.

147
00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:29,286
Huh...

148
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:31,036
Huh.

149
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:32,486
Oh.

150
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,086
Oh, what's... oh, what's this?

151
00:12:35,636 --> 00:12:36,536
Uh oh.

152
00:12:36,986 --> 00:12:41,386
I feel like this is something
I'm quite familiar with.

153
00:12:41,786 --> 00:12:42,586
Eh?

154
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:44,836
Do I walk through it?

155
00:12:45,086 --> 00:12:47,386
I feel like I have to walk through it.

156
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:48,536
Hmm.

157
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:51,386
I bet there's something
behind that door.

158
00:12:51,886 --> 00:12:54,486
Let's go find out.

159
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:56,686
Let's go!

160
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:06,686
Ooh! Wow!

161
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,486
This place is big.
I wonder what it's for.

162
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:12,886
Eh?

163
00:13:13,536 --> 00:13:16,086
Why am I holding a staff?

164
00:13:17,886 --> 00:13:19,386
A weapon?

165
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:22,886
Hmm. I have a bad
feeling about this.

166
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:26,186
Oh...

167
00:13:28,086 --> 00:13:29,086
Eh?

168
00:13:29,186 --> 00:13:32,686
Why do I hear boss music?

169
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:49,786
Don't tell me I have to
fight that thing.

170
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:53,486
I guess I should. Okay.

171
00:13:53,886 --> 00:13:55,286
You got this, Biboo.

172
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:58,286
You've done this before,
it's just more physical now.

173
00:13:58,386 --> 00:14:00,686
Come at me, bro!
Okay, watch this!

174
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:03,686
Hah! Pebbles, go!

175
00:14:04,186 --> 00:14:05,086
Yeah!

176
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:08,186
Okay, I just have to do
that. Okay, okay!

177
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:09,786
Whoa! Oh!

178
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:12,486
Go!

179
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,186
Yeah, I'm not scared of you!

180
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:17,386
Okay, maybe a little bit. Okay!

181
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:19,486
Heh!

182
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:20,986
Yeah!

183
00:14:21,386 --> 00:14:22,486
You're too slow! Hahaha!

184
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:25,486
Try and catch me! Hehehe.

185
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:30,086
Whoa-da-da-da-da-da! Boom!

186
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:31,286
Yeah!

187
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:33,486
Hahaha! More, more, more!

188
00:14:34,486 --> 00:14:35,886
Yeah!

189
00:14:36,086 --> 00:14:38,486
Oh! Ow!

190
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:41,886
Okay...

191
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:44,286
Whoa! Hah!

192
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,186
Hup!

193
00:14:49,786 --> 00:14:50,986
Hah!

194
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:52,586
Nyea!

195
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,586
Whoa! Hah!

196
00:14:57,986 --> 00:14:59,386
Hah! Oh, he's stuck!

197
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:01,186
He's stuck!

198
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:03,786
Okay, I think I'm
running low on mana.

199
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:05,886
Oh, thirsty. Thirsty.

200
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:07,359
Got it!

201
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,759
Okay, I'm ready for you. I'm recharged.

202
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:16,559
Here we go, Pebbles!

203
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,459
Why isn't this working?

204
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,459
I'm not doing that much damage.

205
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:42,159
(Battle cry and death grunt)

206
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:56,059
GAME OVER BWEH

207
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:07,959
I died.

208
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:10,259
I don't know why the Pebbles,

209
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:12,459
they didn't do that much damage.

210
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:16,259
Maybe I have to think of something else.

211
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:19,459
Let me see, let me see if I have anything...

212
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,359
Oh, yeah!

213
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,559
I see. Let's use this.

214
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,059
Okay, I'm ready now.

215
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,359
Round two! Here we go!

216
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:40,959
Okay, big boss man thing, whatever you are...

217
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:44,259
I'm back and I got a big weapon this time!

218
00:16:44,859 --> 00:16:46,459
Yeah, I'm not afraid of you!

219
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,459
Yeah, did that hurt?

220
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,359
Oh, did that hurt? Did that hurt?

221
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,159
You're too slow. I'm faster than you!

222
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,559
And then take this!

223
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,759
And then take that!

224
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:25,459
Oh spooky! Oh boy!

225
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:51,359
What are you doing?

226
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:54,359
Opportunity!

227
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:58,559
Okay, I need to drink.

228
00:17:58,659 --> 00:17:59,659
I have low health.

229
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:06,159
Okay, I feel better now.

230
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:12,159
Are you dying yet?

231
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,459
Please die.

232
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:29,759
Wait, why isn't it doing anything?

233
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,359
(Death grunt)

234
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,059
GAME OVER DANG IT

235
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:03,459
Dang it! I thought switching builds would work.

236
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:07,359
Thank you, respawn crystal. I appreciate it.

237
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,259
What should I do now?

238
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:12,159
I gotta fight that boss.

239
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:17,659
Oh, I have an idea.

240
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,359
Okay, I'm going to dual-wield this time.

241
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,959
That's going to work. Yeah!

242
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:24,259
And I'm going to summon my crystals too.

243
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:28,659
Okay, I'm ready.

244
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:31,759
One more try, I'm going to beat that boss.

245
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:33,459
Let's go!

246
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:43,459
Curse you, big boss man thing!

247
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:46,459
I hereby vow, you will rue this day!

248
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:49,759
It is I, Koseki Bijou!

249
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:53,359
Your fears made rock!

250
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,282
Oh! Oh! Oh! Ugh!

251
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:10,082
Aaaah!

252
00:20:10,182 --> 00:20:11,182
I'm getting stunned!

253
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:12,582
Ugh! I understand!

254
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:17,082
Wait... let me... Ouch! Ouch!

255
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:19,082
No! No!

256
00:20:19,282 --> 00:20:21,082
Oh come on! Oh dear!

257
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:24,082
Stop the block! What the...!

258
00:20:27,882 --> 00:20:30,582
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

259
00:20:30,782 --> 00:20:32,582
Stop that! No!

260
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:34,882
Ugh... Ha!

261
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:39,582
No!

262
00:20:43,882 --> 00:20:46,082
Go away! Go away! Ha!

263
00:20:54,082 --> 00:20:56,582
Yeah you don't like that, huh? Huh? Huh?

264
00:20:56,882 --> 00:21:00,082
Get tired! Oh wait, oh he's mad. Oh dear.

265
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:04,282
Aaaaah! I get it! I get it!

266
00:21:04,582 --> 00:21:06,582
Come here! Hey you!

267
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,582
Over here! Over here! I'm over here! Hey! Hey! Hey!

268
00:21:12,082 --> 00:21:14,582

269
00:21:16,582 --> 00:21:18,582
Heh! Yah! Okay!

270
00:21:20,582 --> 00:21:24,082
Ready? Ha! Yah!

271
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:27,082
Ha! Boom! Yah!

272
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:34,082
I won! Let's go!

273
00:21:35,082 --> 00:21:37,582
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

274
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:39,282
Eh? Oh!

275
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:44,082
So finally you're here, you've finally defeated the first boss.

276
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:46,582
Kaela! What are you doing here?

277
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:51,582
Too bad for you, I am the real final boss.

278
00:21:51,582 --> 00:21:53,082
Uh oh. Uh oh.

279
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:57,082
Yes, so if you want to win, you need to defeat me.

280
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,582
Really?

281
00:21:59,082 --> 00:22:00,582
Come at me bro!

282
00:22:00,582 --> 00:22:01,582
Really?

283
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:02,582
Yeah! Mmm!

284
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:07,082
Wait! Why do you have three health bars?! What the heck?!

285
00:22:07,082 --> 00:22:08,582
Yeah, why not?

286
00:22:09,082 --> 00:22:11,582
Ugh... I'm tired, whatever.

287
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:12,582
Oh, you're tired? Okay then.

288

I tried eating it

352
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:56,225
まだ酸っぱくて泣いた
But it was still sour and I cried

353
00:26:56,225 --> 00:26:58,625
私みたいで
Just like me

354
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:00,425
残せないから
Because I can't leave any

355
00:27:00,425 --> 00:27:02,425
全部食べた
I ate it all

356
00:27:02,425 --> 00:27:03,925

好きだよ
I love you

361
00:27:18,925 --> 00:27:21,925
酸っぱい
Sour

It makes me cry

00:27:28,925 --> 00:27:30,425
好きだよ
I love you

365
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:40,425
イヤ！
IYA!

366
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:43,425
Thanks for singing with me,

367
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:47,225
even though you bonked me and then dragged me here, dang it!

368
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:48,925
How... how you respond from that?

369
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:51,925
I thought you're gonna just die and then the 3D gonna be over.

370
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:53,425
No! I haven't 3D!

371
00:27:53,425 --> 00:27:55,725
This is mine, Kaela!

372
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:58,925
And you almost ruined it by killing me! No!

373
00:27:59,425 --> 00:28:01,925
I'm gonna get my revenge someday.

374
00:28:01,925 --> 00:28:02,625
Oh really?

375
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,625
Yeah! I'm gonna beat you, zombie!

376
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:05,925
I gonna wait for that, yeah.

377
00:28:05,925 --> 00:28:07,925
Yeah!

378
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:09,425
You won't hear the last of me!

379
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:10,925
I mean you invited me here, right? To sing?

380
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:13,925
Yeah, I invited... to sing, not to bonk me!

381
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,225
I invited you to sing together.

382
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:18,925
But then you came in and I was already being the boss and then...

383
00:28:18,925 --> 00:28:20,925
dang it!

384
00:28:21,925 --> 00:28:23,925
That's the plot twist, right? I am the final boss!

385
00:28:23,925 --> 00:28:25,925
Oh my god!

386
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:27,625
Why you have three life bars?

387
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,925
What the bib!

388
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:30,225
You're too weak.

389
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:31,425
You're too weak.

390
00:28:31,425 --> 00:28:33,925
I'm gonna get stronger and beat you!

391
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:35,925
I'm gonna wait for you.

392
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:37,425
But it was fun, you know?

393
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:39,425
Singing with you, it was fun.

394
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:41,925
I guess it was fun.

395
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:43,925
I guess we were pretty cute, right?

396
00:28:43,925 --> 00:28:44,625
No, you cute.

397
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:45,925
I'm cool.

398
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,925
No, I think we were both pretty cute, right?

399
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:51,425
Look at how cute we are together!

400
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:52,625
Where's my hammer?

401
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,425
Can I have my hammer again please?

402
00:28:56,925 --> 00:28:58,625
Yeah, we're cuties,

403
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,425
you have to admit. Haha!

404
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:01,925
I'm cool.

405
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:02,925
I'm...

406
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:04,925
You can be both, right?

407
00:29:05,425 --> 00:29:06,425
No, you cute,

408
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:07,925
I'm cool. No.

409
00:29:08,425 --> 00:29:09,925
I can be cool too, look!

410
00:29:11,425 --> 00:29:12,925
Look at that, with that smile.

411
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:14,625
No, it's not working.

412
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:15,425
Oh...

413
00:29:15,425 --> 00:29:17,425
well, I'll work on it.

414
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,925
D'you like my place?

415
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:22,225
Yeah!

416
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:23,625
Oh, this is your place?

417
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:24,925
Yeah, it's my place!

418
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:26,925
I really love that.

419
00:29:26,925 --> 00:29:28,425
Can I, can I mine that?

420
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,425
No! It's my decoration!

421
00:29:31,425 --> 00:29:33,425
I gotta mine that later after this.

422
00:29:33,425 --> 00:29:35,925
Whenever you're not seeing, I gotta mine that.

423
00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:37,425
You know what?

424
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:38,625
You can leave now.

425
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:39,225
Oh really?

426
00:29:39,225 --> 00:29:39,925
Yeah!

427
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:40,625
Oh really?

428
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:41,625
Just like that?

429
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:43,425
You've caused nothing but trouble here!

430
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:44,625
Oh, just like that, I see.

431
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:45,725
Okay fine.

432
00:29:45,725 --> 00:29:46,925
Wait, I changed my mind,

433
00:29:46,925 --> 00:29:47,925
you can stay!

434
00:29:47,925 --> 00:29:49,425
No, I'm getting my exit.

435
00:29:49,425 --> 00:29:50,225
What?

436
00:29:50,225 --> 00:29:51,425
What... what are you doing?

437
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:52,925
Hah!

438
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:53,425
Oh...

439
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:53,925
Bye!

440
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,925
KAELA!

441
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:57,625
Bye!

442
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:58,625
Oh...

443
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:01,425
I guess she's gone.

444
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,425
Ah well,

445
00:30:03,425 --> 00:30:05,725
thank you Kaela for singing with me.

446
00:30:06,245 --> 00:30:08,445
grindstone together forever.

447
00:30:08,945 --> 00:30:09,745
Yeah!

448
00:30:10,345 --> 00:30:11,245
But now,

449
00:30:11,545 --> 00:30:14,645
that I've been rudely put here by Kaela,

450
00:30:15,245 --> 00:30:17,945
I guess we should explore the place a little bit, huh?

451
00:30:18,845 --> 00:30:19,545
Want to go?

452
00:30:19,745 --> 00:30:20,445
Let's go!

453
00:30:20,745 --> 00:30:21,445
Okay!

454
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,545
Yay!

455
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:55,120
Now Loading...

456
00:31:05,745 --> 00:31:07,545
The air feels good over here.

457
00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:10,245
Wow!

458
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:14,645
This place looks a lot different from when I last left it,

459
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:18,245
but I kind of like it better this way. Yeah!

460
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:21,245
Oh! There's a Moai!

461
00:31:21,745 --> 00:31:22,945
Look!

462
00:31:24,145 --> 00:31:26,645
Ooh, nice Moai. I approve, I approve.

463
00:31:27,145 --> 00:31:28,645
Very nice, very tall.

464
00:31:29,145 --> 00:31:30,545
Very かっこいい. Yes!
Very cool. Yes!

465
00:31:31,645 --> 00:31:32,645
Oh!

466
00:31:33,145 --> 00:31:34,545
Look! Grass!

467
00:31:36,545 --> 00:31:37,645
Watch this!

468
00:31:38,545 --> 00:31:41,045
Biboo's touching grass!

469
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:44,345
Look at the flowers! Oh, they're so pretty!

470
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:50,345
That feels good, yeah.

471
00:31:51,445 --> 00:31:53,545
That smells great!

472
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,645
Touching grass isn't so bad.

473
00:31:57,445 --> 00:32:00,145
I kind of like it.

474
00:32:01,445 --> 00:32:02,345
Okay!

475
00:32:05,145 --> 00:32:06,945
Let's keep exploring!

476
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:14,245
Everything's so pretty!

477
00:32:15,145 --> 00:32:16,645
Oh, is that a chair?

478
00:32:17,345 --> 00:32:19,545
Ooh, it looks comfy!

479
00:32:20,945 --> 00:32:23,645
It's not a plastic chair, but it'll do.

480
00:32:24,745 --> 00:32:26,145
I'll sit on it.

481
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:27,645
But not now, later.

482
00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:31,145
Later, we got a lot of exploring to do.

483
00:32:35,145 --> 00:32:38,545
Oh hey! That's where I was before!

484
00:32:39,545 --> 00:32:41,945
Yeah! Until Kaela brutally bonked me

485
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:44,345
and dragged me here.

486
00:32:45,945 --> 00:32:47,945
Whatever, I didn't have to walk,

487
00:32:48,345 --> 00:32:50,645
so thanks Kaela, I guess.

488
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:54,645
Crystals!

489
00:32:55,145 --> 00:32:57,645
Look at the architecture! The sky! Wow!

490
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,145
Huh?

491
00:33:02,545 --> 00:33:03,345
Eh?

492
00:33:03,745 --> 00:33:05,145
In the tall grass!

493
00:33:05,345 --> 00:33:08,145
Is that a wild Pebblemon?

494
00:33:09,545 --> 00:33:11,145
Wow! It's so cute!

495
00:33:11,945 --> 00:33:13,545
Can I have it? I want it! I want it!

496
00:33:16,645 --> 00:33:18,445
I got an idea. Okay.

497
00:33:30,145 --> 00:33:31,145
Okay.

498
00:33:31,545 --> 00:33:33,645
Yeah, I'm gonna catch it with this.

499
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:35,945
I got one shot though.

500
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:38,645
I'm ready. I'm ready.

501
00:33:39,345 --> 00:33:41,645
氷晶... 陣内！
Crystal... Prison!

502
00:33:48,145 --> 00:33:51,645
Yay! Let's go see, let's go see!

503
00:33:54,945 --> 00:33:57,645
I caught a Pebblemon!

504
00:33:58,345 --> 00:34:00,645
Yay!

505
00:34:02,145 --> 00:34:04,345
I caught a Pebblemon! I caught a Pebblemon!

506
00:34:04,645 --> 00:34:06,645
Yay yay yay!

507
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:32,120
Now Loading...

508
00:34:38,445 --> 00:34:39,745
Nice weather. I hate it.

509
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,745
Why are we here? I don't know.

510
00:34:43,645 --> 00:34:44,945
Senpai! Hey!

511
00:34:45,145 --> 00:34:45,945
Hey!

512
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:46,945
Hi!

513
00:34:47,145 --> 00:34:48,945
Our eyes met. We have to battle!

514
00:34:49,745 --> 00:34:51,145
Wait, fight you, bro?

515
00:34:51,345 --> 00:34:52,545
Fight you?

516
00:34:52,945 --> 00:34:55,145
Did Towa-sama say "bro"? What?

517
00:34:56,145 --> 00:34:58,145
Come on, senpai tax, baby! Pay up!

518
00:34:58,545 --> 00:35:01,645
Wait, but there's two of you and there's one of me!

519
00:35:02,145 --> 00:35:04,345
I need help! Somebody fix this!

520
00:35:06,144 --> 00:35:07,444
I choose...

521
00:35:07,444 --> 00:35:08,644
No, guys!

522
00:35:10,144 --> 00:35:10,944
You're here!

523
00:35:11,244 --> 00:35:15,244
With the powers of chuuni, we will defeat them!

524
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:16,044
Yeah!

525
00:35:16,044 --> 00:35:16,644
I don't think so.

526
00:35:16,644 --> 00:35:17,544
I'm the Chuuni!

527
00:35:17,544 --> 00:35:21,744
No no no no no... Good luck, kohai.
No no no no no... Good luck, junior.

528
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:25,544
It's time to battle!

529
00:35:30,144 --> 00:35:32,644
Team Baby, ready to fight!

530
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:35,644
Biboo, that's right! Go!

531
00:35:35,644 --> 00:35:38,144
Pebblemon! No! Get her!

532
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,644
Koseki Bijou, that was so big! Be careful!

533
00:35:48,644 --> 00:35:50,644
Koseki Bijou... Uh oh!

534
00:35:52,144 --> 00:35:53,944
Okay, that was kind of weird.

535
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,144
It's my turn now.

536
00:35:55,144 --> 00:36:00,144
Okay, Morimon, use Bloody Nightmare!

537
00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:05,644
Sucker!

538
00:36:09,144 --> 00:36:12,144
No! Help! Help! Help!

539
00:36:13,144 --> 00:36:16,644
Fine! I will teach you how it's done! Biboon!

540
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:22,144
From the fiery depths, yes, Eternal Embers Ablaze!

541
00:36:39,644 --> 00:36:43,144
Okay, my turn! Senpai!

542
00:36:43,644 --> 00:36:48,144
ど、どうしよう。とりあえず中行け！
Wh-what should I do? Anyway, go inside!

543
00:36:52,144 --> 00:36:55,144
Nice shot! Nice shot!

544
00:36:55,144 --> 00:36:58,644
大勝利！
Big victory!

545
00:37:00,144 --> 00:37:02,644
Okay, I wanna do a cool move.

546
00:37:02,644 --> 00:37:04,644
Come on, Koseki Bijou, I'm counting on you!

547
00:37:04,644 --> 00:37:09,144
I'll show you! No! Judgment Ray Ende!

548
00:37:20,144 --> 00:37:24,144
Gosh, this battle's... you know what? Stay there.

549
00:37:24,144 --> 00:37:27,144
What? What? What?

550
00:37:28,144 --> 00:37:31,644
Betray Biboo? Oh, great idea! I love that.

551
00:37:32,644 --> 00:37:36,644
All right, Biboo! Time to pay the step-by-step!

552
00:37:37,644 --> 00:37:40,144
All right, three against one, what you gonna do?

553
00:37:40,144 --> 00:37:44,144
What you gonna do? What you gonna do, Biboo?

554
00:37:44,644 --> 00:37:46,144
Pochi! Help me!

555
00:37:46,644 --> 00:37:49,144
A top ten anime betrayals!

556
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:52,144
Help, I need help! Get down! Get down!

557
00:37:52,644 --> 00:37:55,644
Yo, what is that thing? I've never seen that thing in my life.

558
00:37:55,644 --> 00:37:59,144
Go, Pebblemon! Rock Kitty!

559
00:38:02,644 --> 00:38:04,644
Wait a minute. Look up!

560
00:38:16,144 --> 00:38:21,144
Biboo is the winner! I won! I won! I won!

561
00:38:21,144 --> 00:38:26,644
I won! I won! I won! And now you guys have to sing a song with me! Yeah!

562
00:38:26,644 --> 00:38:29,644
Biboo, I don't know... I can't sing.

563
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:33,144
I won! I won! I won! I won! Yeah!

564
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:37,644
Guys, what's that? What's that? That thing? What's that?

565
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:39,144
Look out!

566
00:38:52,144 --> 00:38:54,644
Take my Biboo long!

567
00:38:54,644 --> 00:38:55,644
Get a job!

568
00:38:58,644 --> 00:39:01,644
Wakey-wakey, time for school!

569
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:05,944
Available on the BibooStation

570
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:20,644
Inside identity, 居場所はどこ？
Inside identity, where is my place?

571
00:39:21,644 --> 00:39:26,644
INSIDE IDENTITY
Lyrics • Music: ZAQ

572
00:39:31,144 --> 00:39:36,144
勘違いが弾けたとか　素直さが痛いとか
Misunderstandings burst, honesty hurts...

573
00:39:36,444 --> 00:39:41,544
誰かが何と言おうと　正しさなんてわかんないぜ
No matter what anyone says, I don't know what's right.

574
00:39:41,844 --> 00:39:46,944
普通に流れていく日常に　無理して馴染ませた
Forcing myself to fit into the flow of daily life.

575
00:39:47,244 --> 00:39:52,144
焦燥ももっとこさえた自分を　噛んで飲んで吐いて笑う
Biting, swallowing, spitting out my frustration and laughing.

576
00:39:52,444 --> 00:39:56,244
あんな僕をわかってほしい
I want you to understand that version of me.

577
00:39:56,544 --> 00:40:00,144
痛いけど言えなくて
It hurts but I can't say it.

578
00:40:00,444 --> 00:40:05,944
なんで誰もわかってくんないのと
Why doesn't anyone understand me?

579
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:11,568
...思うのぜいたくなのかななのかな
...Is it too selfish to think that way?

580
00:40:11,688 --> 00:40:16,118
感情的な太陽は
The emotional sun

581
00:40:16,218 --> 00:40:21,968
熱を上げすぎてどうにかなりそう
Raises its heat so much that I'm about to lose it

582
00:40:22,188 --> 00:40:26,118
叫びたくてしょうがない
I want to scream so badly

583
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:32,418
がむしゃらに求めてるアイデンティティ
My identity that I'm frantically searching for

584
00:40:32,618 --> 00:40:36,618
Inside my feeling...

585
00:40:36,718 --> 00:40:42,418
Inside my justice... 邪魔しないで 居場所はどこ?
Inside my justice... Don't get in my way, where do I belong?

586
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:58,618
「変わったね」誰かが言ってお隣でこだまして
"You've changed," someone says, echoing next to me

587
00:40:58,718 --> 00:41:04,368
ぱたんなに張ってんだか壁 捏ねて起きて今日も最低点
Against what am I putting up a wall? Waking up and starting another awful day

588
00:41:04,468 --> 00:41:09,318
飾ったってこの表情が苦手な僕がいるよ
There's a version of me that's bad at this decorated expression

589
00:41:09,418 --> 00:41:14,618
僕にしかできないことがるってのもしってんだけど
I know there's something only I can do

590
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:19,318
tell me 誰だってどうにかが心配なの
Tell me, everyone's worried about something

591
00:41:19,418 --> 00:41:23,618
頷く言葉 ただ一つ
There's only one word to agree on

592
00:41:23,718 --> 00:41:29,168
本当はどうなのが気になるよ
I'm curious what the truth really is

593
00:41:29,268 --> 00:41:34,618
答えを探すの 見つけたい 見つめたい
Searching for an answer, I want to find it, I want to gaze at it

594
00:41:34,718 --> 00:41:39,318
孤独を知って愛を知る
Learning of loneliness and learning of love

595
00:41:39,418 --> 00:41:44,318
割り切れるほど大人じゃないんだが
I'm not mature enough to just let it go

596
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:49,168
寂しいけれど譲れない
It's lonely, but I won't back down

597
00:41:49,268 --> 00:41:55,168
僕だけのブレないアイデンティティ
My very own unwavering identity

598
00:42:16,218 --> 00:42:21,618
行くのこれだけじゃダメさ
Just going like this isn't enough

599
00:42:21,718 --> 00:42:26,618
何かを感じたいからここにいるわけさ
The reason I'm here is because I want to feel something

600
00:42:26,718 --> 00:42:31,618
誰かにもらった快楽が
Pleasure given to me by someone else

601
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:37,018
僕の幸せとは限らないぜ
Doesn't necessarily mean it's my happiness

602
00:42:37,118 --> 00:42:42,618
名も無い毎日だけど
Even though my days are nameless

603
00:42:42,718 --> 00:42:48,018
意味を確立できる日は来るよ
The day I can establish meaning will come

604
00:42:48,118 --> 00:42:53,118
中二病と呼ばれても
Even if I'm called a "Chuunibyou"

605
00:42:53,218 --> 00:42:58,318
モラトリアムの渦の中
Inside the whirlpool of moratorium

606
00:42:58,418 --> 00:43:03,118
感情的な太陽は
The emotional sun

607
00:43:03,218 --> 00:43:08,618
熱を上げすぎてどうにかなりそう
Raises its heat so much that I'm about to lose it

608
00:43:08,718 --> 00:43:13,618
叫びたくてしょうがない
I want to scream so badly

609
00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:19,618
がむしゃらに求めてるアイデンティティ
My identity that I'm frantically searching for

610
00:43:19,718 --> 00:43:24,118
Inside my feeling...

611
00:43:24,218 --> 00:43:29,618
Inside my justice... 邪魔しないで 居場所はどこ?
Inside my justice... Don't get in my way, where do I belong?

612
00:43:33,668 --> 00:43:38,568
Happy 3D Showcase Biboo!

613
00:43:38,668 --> 00:43:41,168
Yeah, that was so much fun! We did it!

614
00:43:41,268 --> 00:43:43,668
Oh my gosh, congratulations!

615
00:43:43,768 --> 00:43:45,668
Calli! Towa! Congrats!

616
00:43:45,768 --> 00:43:47,168
Happy 3D!

617
00:43:47,268 --> 00:43:49,168
Thanks for inviting us!

618
00:43:49,268 --> 00:43:53,168
Of course! Now that you're here,
is there any poses you want me to do?

619
00:43:53,268 --> 00:43:54,668
Do the worm!

620
00:43:54,768 --> 00:43:55,668
The worm? Oh, okay!

621
00:43:55,768 --> 00:43:58,968
Go, go, go, go! Woo!

622
00:43:59,068 --> 00:44:01,668
How was that? Was that good?

623
00:44:01,768 --> 00:44:02,668
Wonderful.

624
00:44:03,168 --> 00:44:06,168
Yes! So much fun! Congrats!

625
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,668
Thank you for inviting us!

626
00:44:08,768 --> 00:44:10,368
Yeah! How do you feel, Towa-sama?

627
00:44:10,468 --> 00:44:11,968
I feel very good!

628
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:13,668
You feel good? I'm so happy!

629
00:44:13,768 --> 00:44:16,168
I chose this song because,

630
00:44:16,268 --> 00:44:18,668
you know, we're all very 'chuuni', right?

631
00:44:18,768 --> 00:44:20,668
Chuuni? Senpai chuuni Biboo?

632
00:44:20,768 --> 00:44:22,668
Is Towa-senpai chuuni too?

633
00:44:22,768 --> 00:44:25,568
No, I chose Towa-sama because
I wanted to sing with Towa-sama!

634
00:44:25,668 --> 00:44:28,668
Aww, so cute! I wanted to sing with you too!

635
00:44:28,768 --> 00:44:29,668
Arigatou gozaimasu!

636
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:30,668
Yoshi yoshi! Cute!

637
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,668
Hehehe, E-N-E?

638
00:44:32,768 --> 00:44:34,368
E-N-E! E-N-E!

639
00:44:34,468 --> 00:44:36,668
ENE generation! Yay!

640
00:44:36,768 --> 00:44:39,668
Yay! E-N-E!

641
00:44:40,168 --> 00:44:42,668
Thank you guys so much

642
00:44:42,768 --> 00:44:44,668
for being a part of my 3D! I'm so honored!

643
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:47,668
No problem! But next time,

644
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:51,168
I'm gonna beat you in Pebblemon! Watch out!

645
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:54,668
Yeah, you better watch out for us three!
Pay your senpai tax!

646
00:44:54,768 --> 00:44:56,168
I'll fight back!

647
00:44:56,268 --> 00:44:58,168
I'm not going down without a fight!

648
00:44:58,268 --> 00:45:00,168
That's the spirit! Good luck!

649
00:45:00,268 --> 00:45:05,168
We wish you luck for the rest of your 3D! Bye-bye!

650
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:09,692
Biboo! Biboo! Biboo!

651
00:45:13,317 --> 00:45:15,692
Hah... they're gone now.

652
00:45:15,792 --> 00:45:19,992
Oh, that was so much fun singing with my senpais!

653
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,692
Oh, I'm so happy!

654
00:45:23,692 --> 00:45:27,192
But I guess now it's just us, huh? Mmm...

655
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:29,992
Wait! Wait a second!

656
00:45:30,592 --> 00:45:34,192
Oh! It's you! Hello!

657
00:45:35,192 --> 00:45:38,692
Everyone, everyone, I want to introduce you to my buddy.

658
00:45:39,392 --> 00:45:45,692
This is the Grand Executioner of Worlds!

659
00:45:47,192 --> 00:45:49,192
What? That's his name.

660
00:45:49,692 --> 00:45:52,692
Yes, Grand Executioner of Worlds.

661
00:45:53,192 --> 00:45:56,192
Fine, you can call him Geo or whatever, I guess.

662
00:45:56,292 --> 00:45:59,192
But his real name's Grand Executioner of Worlds, okay?

663
00:45:59,692 --> 00:46:01,692
Geo. Geo.

664
00:46:02,692 --> 00:46:05,692
Cute! Thank you for coming!

665
00:46:06,692 --> 00:46:11,692
Actually, did you know Geo and I have been friends for a long, long time?

666
00:46:12,192 --> 00:46:17,192
But, you know, when I got... you know, in jail, we kind of got separated...

667
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:21,192
...because he— Aw, don't be sad! Don't be sad!

668
00:46:21,692 --> 00:46:27,192
I'm back now. Have you been waiting here for me this whole time?

669
00:46:27,692 --> 00:46:33,692
Aw, thank you Geo, my loyal companion. I missed you too. Aw.

670
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:39,192
Well, you're going to be seeing a lot more of Geo from now on, so...

671
00:46:39,692 --> 00:46:45,192
Yeah! I'm so happy to finally introduce you to him! Yeah!

672
00:46:46,692 --> 00:46:54,692
So everyone, how is my 3D debut? Did you like it? Did you have fun?

673
00:46:55,192 --> 00:46:59,192
I had so much fun with Kaela, and Towa senpai, and Callie...

674
00:46:59,292 --> 00:47:04,192
...and Hakos Baelz. Yeah, it was such a good time.

675
00:47:04,692 --> 00:47:08,192
I had so much fun.

676
00:47:10,192 --> 00:47:13,192
Wait a second. Hmm...

677
00:47:13,692 --> 00:47:18,692
Was there something that you wanted me to do in 3D?

678
00:47:19,192 --> 00:47:25,192
Like a very specific, I don't know, dance or something?

679
00:47:25,692 --> 00:47:28,192
I think you know what I'm talking about.

680
00:47:28,692 --> 00:47:34,192
But... ah, I'm a little tired. I don't think I have the energy to do—

681
00:47:34,692 --> 00:47:38,192
Sticking out your gyatt for the rizzler,

682
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:42,192
you're so skibidi, you're so Fanum Tax.

683
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:46,192
I just want to be your sigma!

684
00:47:47,192 --> 00:47:50,192
Heh. Heh heh heh.

685
00:47:50,292 --> 00:47:53,992
You didn't think I would end this 3D without doing that, huh?

686
00:47:54,192 --> 00:47:57,192
Get Bibootaxed! Yay!

687
00:47:57,692 --> 00:48:03,692
But now, I have some announcements to make!

688
00:48:04,192 --> 00:48:09,692
Wait, wait, wait, Geo, Geo, Geo! Do you want to help me? Do you want to help me announce some things?

689
00:48:10,192 --> 00:48:12,192
Okay, cool!

690
00:48:12,692 --> 00:48:17,692
So, my announcement today is...

691
00:48:18,192 --> 00:48:23,692
Merch! 3D Live merch! Yay!

692
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:27,192
And first up, I have...

693
00:48:27,692 --> 00:48:31,192
Boom! What are those?

694
00:48:27,692 --> 00:49:00,192

Ah, man. I was having so much fun. Are you sad, pebbles? Are you sad?

706
00:49:33,692 --> 00:49:41,192

Dear Pebbles,

744
00:54:14,883 --> 00:54:16,683
Hi! It's Biboo!

745
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:19,417
How did you enjoy the showcase?

746
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:21,217
Did it rock? (heh)

747
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:24,883
To be honest, I missed you all lots
these few months!

748
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:27,217
Not being able to stream as much and

749
00:54:27,217 --> 00:54:29,350
hang out with everyone was a little lonely...

750
00:54:29,417 --> 00:54:32,883
BUT! I knew the end result was going to be worth it!

751
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:35,717
So, Biboo took all the feelings of her Pebbles

752
00:54:35,717 --> 00:54:37,950
who were cheering her on and turned it into POWER.

753
00:54:38,017 --> 00:54:40,717
She learned so many new things like how to dance

754
00:54:40,717 --> 00:54:43,950
and different ways to sing all in the hopes that
Pebbles would be proud of her one day.

755
00:54:44,017 --> 00:54:47,950
I hope one of those days is today.

756
00:54:48,017 --> 00:54:50,417
BUT TODAY is just the beginning!

757
00:54:50,483 --> 00:54:53,683
After today, we've unlocked a whole new
DIMENSION of Biboo!

758
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,083
We're just getting started!

759
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:58,717
No matter when or where you found me,

760
00:54:58,717 --> 00:55:00,617
I hope you will continue to join me on this journey.

761
00:55:07,592 --> 00:55:09,092
After today, we've unlocked a whole new

762
00:55:09,092 --> 00:55:11,242
dimension of Biboo! We're just getting started!

763
00:55:11,342 --> 00:55:13,992
So, no matter when or where you found me,

764
00:55:13,992 --> 00:55:16,992
I hope you will continue to join me on this journey,

765
00:55:17,042 --> 00:55:18,592
TOGETHAAA

00:55:18,642 --> 00:55:21,692
This small rock is gonna do BIG things!!

767
00:55:21,742 --> 00:55:24,092
So keep watching, okay?

768
00:55:24,142 --> 00:55:27,192
Today, I am shining bright because of you.

769
00:55:27,242 --> 00:55:30,192
So, from the bottom of my heart,

770
00:55:30,242 --> 00:55:32,692

771
00:55:32,742 --> 00:55:35,192
