00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,500
The Empress

3
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Empress (Calliope ver.)

4
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Lyrics: てにをは (歌い分け：Mori Calliope)
Music, Arrangement: てにをは
Lyrics: てにをは (Vocal arrangement: Mori Calliope)
Music, Arrangement: てにをは

5
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,100
私は手近 いで醜い
I'm close at hand, and I'm ugly

6
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,300
テンプレートに流し込まれたみたい
It's like I was poured into a template

7
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,700
デコレーションじゃ隠せない生来の拳、刻
My innate style can't be hidden with decorations... Strike

8
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,850
Remember the name, it's self-obsessed some might say

9
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,950
Ignore the cause, ain't no praise, begin those days

10
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,000
Listen up those place notes, but it's more than just a pretty face

11
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,400
Poison grace, poison snakes, cut the race, cut the brakes

12
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,500
It’s got to be the way you carry yourself

13
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,800
So dissimilar to royalties, hilarious wealth

14
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,000
Nature's spoiling me and you, we should bury ourselves

15
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,200
Or you can sneak atop the throne by honest stylish stealth

16
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,450
So Empress (Wake up!)

17
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,600
心におわす
Dwell in my heart

18
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,950
Empress

19
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,100
どうかお与えください
Please grant it

20
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,200
Empress, Empress

21
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,000
Empress

22
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,200
Empress, Empress

23
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,000
Empress

24
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Wake up, Empress me

25
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,200
左様さ、いかにあるべきか
That's right, how should I be?

26
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,500
Show them all you for

27
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
In this diamond-in-the-rough

28
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,000
いつまでも
Forever

29
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,383
偽物でも　ほら
Even if it's a fake, look

30
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:04,549
背筋が伸びてきたでしょ
Your posture has straightened, hasn't it?

31
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:07,758
ハイカラ作った　このティアラ
This stylish tiara I made

32
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:11,758
そろそろ誰が　本物なのか
It's about time we found out who the real one is

33
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:14,549
教えてあげなくちゃ
I'll have to show you

34
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:24,174
No matter how much space is rented for rent,

35
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:26,549
I'm barely out of pocket and beauty's at no expense, okay?

36
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:28,591
Look confident, got you bouncing up on a fence,

37
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:30,841
To the left lies the tempts, so you better use some common sense.

38
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:32,424
Okie-dokie, okay then, Empress,

39
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:34,508
a miracle in the mirror straight up not impressive me.

40
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:36,591
Day to day it's clear I make such a mess of me,

41
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:38,591
Fresh face, dress me to freshen all the guests and be...

42
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:40,549
Empress,

43
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,549
心のまま
As your heart desires

44
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:44,549
Empress,

45
00:05:44,674 --> 00:05:47,341
美しくおありなさい
Stay beautiful

46
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:52,549
Empress, Empress, Empress...

47
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:55,716
Empress!

48
00:05:56,549 --> 00:05:58,549
Wake up, Empress in me

49
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,049
ほら、頭を垂れなさい
Now, bow your head

50
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,383
Show them why it's time to

51
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:04,424
do much more than meets the eye.

52
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:06,591
蔓延ってるあの
That widespread,

53
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:09,049
市民権得た流行のビシャス
socially accepted trendy vice

54
00:06:09,174 --> 00:06:13,049
ほっとけ　涙が勿体ないから
Leave it be, your tears are a waste

55
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:17,049
そろそろ誰が　本物なのか
It's about time we found out who the real one is

56
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,508
教えてあげなくちゃ
I'll have to show you

57
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:31,549
桜は　己を
The cherry blossoms realize

58
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:35,549
美しと自覚せるか
That they are beautiful

59
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:39,549
蓮華は　自分を
The lotus blossoms bloom

60
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:43,549
可憐だと思い咲けるか
Thinking that they are lovely

61
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:47,341
漏れなく　こよなく
Without fail, dearly

62
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:51,549
魂を磨くこと
Polish your soul

63
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:55,549
気高く　濁らず
Nobly, without getting muddy

64
00:06:55,674 --> 00:06:59,549
美をばよ　全う致しましょう
Let's fulfill our beauty

65
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:05,133
目覚めよ、Empress in me
Awaken, Empress in me

66
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,549
さぁ、玉座を空けなさい
Now, clear the throne

67
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:09,133
Show them why it's time to

68
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:11,841
burn it down and take the throne.

69
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:14,049
Empress in me

70
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,091
もっと頭を垂れなさい
Bow your head lower

71
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:18,133
Show them why it's time to

72
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:19,549
do much more than meets the eye.

73
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:22,049
偽物でも　ほら
Even if it's a fake, look

74
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:25,049
背筋が伸びてきたでしょ
Your posture has straightened, hasn't it?

75
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:28,049
ハイカラ作った　このティアラ
This stylish tiara I made

76
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:32,049
そろそろ誰が　本物なのか
It's about time we found out who the real one is

77
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:36,049
分からせてあげましょう　優しく
I'll make you understand, gently

78
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:38,174
It's about time to reveal

79
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,549
it's the me that I knew was real all along.

80
00:07:40,674 --> 00:07:44,549
Something's wrong, guess I gotta show you my appeal.

81
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:52,549
Wake me up, wake me up...

82
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:56,549
Uh oh, wake me up...

83
00:07:57,049 --> 00:08:00,049
Uh oh, wake me up, wake me up...

84
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:04,049
Wake me up.

85
00:08:19,424 --> 00:08:22,049
えへん！
Ahem!

86
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:25,049
皆さん、ようこそ、カリオペ誕生日ライブへ！
Welcome everyone to Calliope's Birthday Live!

87
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:29,549
Welcome everybody to this year's live show, ARCANA!

88
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:32,841
The Arcana is the means by which all is revealed.

89
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:36,049
Is it not, Dead Beats? I know you guys know what I'm talking about, right?

90
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,049
Check it out, first of all, this stage.

91
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:41,549
ステージ、素敵ですね。
The stage is wonderful, isn't it?

92
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:44,841
Look, we're in a crystal ball! Can you believe it?

93
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:48,549
This was all Mori's idea, which it might have been a bad idea...

94
00:08:48,674 --> 00:08:52,049
...'cause I don't know how we're gonna get out of here. Well, we'll figure it out.

95
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:55,549
But in the meantime, guess what? I have assembled all of these tarot cards here.

96
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:59,049
Tarot cards featuring my friends!

97
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:03,049
For example, right, we have Marine-senchou, who I just performed Empress with.

98
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:08,549
Yes, yes, a bit of artwork on her card over here for The Empress, so lovely.

99
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:13,049
Thank you so much to Gumshrue for drawing these beautiful illustrations.

100
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:16,841
Um, but yeah, I decided to pick Arcana that, like, fit my friends.

101
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:20,549
But then I took it a bit further and decided, "What if we sang a bunch of Mori songs?"

102
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:24,549
そうですね、今日は森カリオペだけの曲、歌います！
That's right, today I'll sing only Mori Calliope songs!

103
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,549
That's right!

104
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:30,049
This show is Mori songs only. That's right.

105
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:34,549
And I tried to pick songs that fit the Arcana and then matched them up with talents...

106
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:38,049
...that I thought also fit the Arcana.

107
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:41,549
So we have some amazing guests lined up today...

108
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:45,549
...and I hope that you guys will get super excited because I've been looking forward to this for so long.

109
00:09:45,674 --> 00:09:49,049
Thank you so much, everybody, for dropping by to be a part of this.

110
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:52,549
And you know what? You can continue to be a part of it.

111
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:55,049
How can you do that? You might ask. By using the hashtag!

112
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:58,549
Yes, up in one of these corners is gonna be the hashtag...

113
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,049
...it's probably over here, but it might also be over here.

114
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,049
Use the hashtag, okay?

115
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:03,549
Oh, the hashtag that we have decided upon
for this show, okay?

116
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:06,682
So make sure that you use that and then type
your impressions, right?

117
00:10:06,682 --> 00:10:08,849
You guys love the internet.
You're always doing stuff on it...

118
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:11,782
...and saying silly stuff here, there and everywhere.

119
00:10:11,782 --> 00:10:13,616
Go ahead and, you know,

120
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:16,849
upload screenshots and your thoughts and
impressions and I'll read 'em.

121
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,449
I'll read 'em later.

122
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:20,682
Once I've, you know, calmed down and stuff like that,
you know?

123
00:10:20,682 --> 00:10:22,582
Because we got a show to do, right?

124
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:25,582
WE GOT A SHOW TO DO!

125
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:29,449
Let's try and have as much fun as we can while we
are stuck here in this crystal ball together.

126
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:31,082
For Mori's birthday, yes! And it's Mori's birthday,

127
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:34,016
so you know that we've got announcements, right?

128
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:36,149
Stick till the end because

129
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:38,949
we got a couple really big ones coming up and you
don't want to miss 'em.

130
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:40,816
If you want. You don't have to, but...

131
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:44,216
...but if you want to... you should. You should stay.

132
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:46,482
Stick around. Hang out with us. It's gonna be fun.

133
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:51,116
Oh, what kind of songs can you expect to hear,
I wonder? Hmm?

134
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:54,416
Only some of Mori's favorites.

135
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,116
Yes, there are actually... um... mostly guests.

136
00:10:57,116 --> 00:11:00,182
I think there's maybe one solo song, but...

137
00:11:00,182 --> 00:11:03,216
...almost every single song has a guest.

138
00:11:03,216 --> 00:11:08,582
Wow, probably the most guests that I have ever had

139
00:11:08,582 --> 00:11:10,882
in any live that I have ever done. All guests!

140
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:12,782
And also very few MCs.

141
00:11:12,782 --> 00:11:14,949
That's right. We're gonna be too focused on performing,

142
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:17,649
so get ready to not hear a lot of talking,

143
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:20,116
but there's gonna be lots of singing and dancing!

144
00:11:20,116 --> 00:11:22,516
Why am I being goofy? This isn't how I'm supposed
to be on stage.

145
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,582
I'm supposed to be goofy during streams and think
goofy on stage.

146
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:27,782
But I can't help myself.

147
00:11:27,782 --> 00:11:30,216
I can't help myself. I'm a... I'm a dummy.
What can I say?

148
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:31,949
Don't say that. Don't put yourself down, Mori.

149
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:34,649
The MC is going off the rails, so we better just
continue singing at this point.

150
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:38,016
Or else I'm gonna say something even more stupid.

151
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:40,416
Yes. I love MCs, Dead Beats! You guys know this...

152
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,716
...I really don't love MCs. Let the show go on, yeah?

153
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:48,449
Oh, but first, I have to summon the next guest.

154
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:50,582
That's right.

155
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:54,516
The next guest I will be bringing forward
with this...

156
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:56,516
...tarot card.

157
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,349
As you can see, these are very powerful.

158
00:11:58,349 --> 00:12:01,349
So, let's go ahead and call the next person and
get this show rolling.

159
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:03,616
Here we go!

160
00:12:03,616 --> 00:12:05,182
Taza!

161
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:35,016
興味ない 持ってない やってないし 感じない 感じ外
I don't care, I don't have it, I'm not doing it,
I don't feel it, out of touch

162
00:12:35,316 --> 00:12:41,016
How did it get to this no regrets we just run into
the night

163
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:41,016
タイド
Tide

164
00:12:41,316 --> 00:12:43,116
Backs to the walls crackin' let me out

165
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:45,316
I'm losin' grip before I fall back and take a bow

166
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,316
Missed hits and pitfalls level up

167
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:50,416
Our festive time is limited so do it now

168
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:54,616
鳴り止まないまま 置いていかれた髪と声
While it won't stop ringing, the hair and voice
left behind

169
00:12:55,716 --> 00:13:00,716
叫び続けろ 誰かが気づいてくれるまで
Keep on screaming, until someone notices

170
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:05,116
Inside I can't give up, my soul moves just a little

171
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:10,816
Another slight voice in my mind, I can turn
the tide

172
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:15,116
Inside I can't give up, my soul moves just a little

173
00:13:15,216 --> 00:13:18,116
I've found it hard to be strong

174
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:20,616
And as I go along I'm falling out of touch

175
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:25,116
Seek out your fire, re-ignite your flame

176
00:13:25,316 --> 00:13:30,416
No more living sick and tired, no apologies required

177
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:35,016
And I know maybe there's no one else who
feels the same

178
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:41,216
Passion fades but so do scars, we'll paint the
future make it ours

179
00:13:45,016 --> 00:13:48,816
曖昧な日々でも意味ある
Even vague days have meaning

180
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:52,516

I'll just go as far as I can

00:13:55,116 --> 00:13:57,916

目の前のその壁を壊せ

183

obscenely greedy

What's hiding it, reveal it, move tomorrow and
the day after

185

もうしない否定
I won't deny it anymore

186
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,616
It's irrelevant if you end up a shell of what
you were

187
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:16,816
Pushin' the limits to be and now there's no
tellin' where

188
00:14:16,816 --> 00:14:19,416
You'll end up if you say that it's over, hold it
together

189
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,016
You know we're still in control the moment workin'
through hazards and loss

190
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:26,516
I wanna push it past the steam just a little

191
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:32,216
And as a little voice control it, I can turn
the tide

192
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:36,716
Inside I can't give up, my soul moves just a little

193
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:41,916
もう止められねえ この体を炎の中へ
I can't be stopped anymore, throw this body
into the flames

194
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:46,716
Seek out your fire, re-ignite your flame

195
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:51,816
No more living sick and tired, no apologies required

196
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:56,516
And I know maybe there's no one else who
feels the same

197
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:00,016
Passion fades but so do scars, we'll paint the
future make it ours

198
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,824
...make it ours.

199
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:03,324
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

200
00:15:03,324 --> 00:15:07,024
I wanna push for destiny
Just a little, a little.

201
00:15:07,024 --> 00:15:09,624
Now it's time to go 'cause the fight is still on, yeah.

202
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:12,324
The night is never running when the spark is gone, you know.

203
00:15:12,324 --> 00:15:16,824
Refill some light inside your room, just a little, a little.

204
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:22,024
Whoa...

205
00:15:23,024 --> 00:15:24,524
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

206
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,524
Seek out your fire, re-ignite your flame!

207
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:30,524
No more living sick and tired
No apologies required.

208
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:33,424
And I know...

209
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:37,724
Maybe there's no one else who feels the same.

210
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:41,024
Passion fades, but so do scars
We'll paint the future, make it ours.

211
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,024
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

212
00:15:47,324 --> 00:15:50,524
曖昧な日々でも意味ある
Even vague days have meaning,

213
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:53,524

216
00:16:49,524 --> 00:16:53,024
Get out the rat race, chasing simple evolve
But the Kingdom of Swindom is open to all.

217
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:57,024
Until the game hits a place to make a profit
Rep-a-swing is the thing now, moving your stuff.

218
00:16:57,024 --> 00:17:00,624
Look-a-boys, a-lady. Look-a-boys, a-heady.
Look-under-lady. Look-a-boys, a-heady.

281
00:21:45,932 --> 00:21:48,532
Unpleasant resentment the more you told
Give us out of the binds of stories of old

ここから出ていくために

284
00:21:54,032 --> 00:21:56,532
On the winds of desperation flying

285
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:59,032
For a false world to see

286
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:04,232
Though I may decide to fight it
Fade it is hard to hide it

287
00:22:04,232 --> 00:22:05,432
It's always been decided for me

288
00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:10,832
涙 期待 哀悼を 永遠に流してまた

場所へと進んでゆく Be born inside
Moving toward that place, be born inside

292
00:22:34,032 --> 00:22:36,732
Souls divide called inner side
The dice was decisive, must have it nice

293
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:39,332
A gorgeous device to trigger entice
It's got a price

294
00:22:40,732 --> 00:22:44,632
躍動しよう 私のよう
ただハートは重し 鮮やかなスペース 尊く 掃う
Let's surge, just like me
But the heart is a weight, sweep it away with dignity

295
00:22:44,632 --> 00:22:47,332
They're never gonna change
Why do myself, reject any and all help

296
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,832
Put all my chips and fold to help
Blood, sweat, cross-stopped thoughts invading

297
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:52,432
Nobody's waiting
After all said and done there's nowhere left to run

298
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:55,732
じゃあ R.I.P. 優しいビースト じゃないきゃな
Well then, R.I.P., I've gotta be a kind beast

299

もう 魂すらも不要
Wishing for the beat to stop is like an abnormal corpse
I don't even need a soul anymore

300
00:23:00,032 --> 00:23:01,532
Be born inside!

301
00:23:23,332 --> 00:23:28,232
Our world's turned once again
For that reason I still sing

302
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:33,132
And we've shared so many tears by now
Though I'd never change a thing

303
00:23:33,532 --> 00:23:38,432
泣いても笑って 死にたくなった日々も私なの
Crying, laughing, even those days when I
wanted to die, they are all me

304
00:23:38,432 --> 00:23:43,332
この世界にはもうこれ以上 何もない
There's nothing more left in this world

305
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:46,332
Numbing pain is numbing happiness

306
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:48,832
Something anyone can find

307
00:23:49,232 --> 00:23:53,932
進もう 自分のためさ
Let's move forward, for my own sake

308
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:59,532
この絶望の風の中飛んでゆく
I'll fly through this wind of despair

309
00:24:00,032 --> 00:24:05,032
何を求めるの 運命に抗いはしないのに
What are you seeking? Though I don't
resist destiny...

310
00:24:05,532 --> 00:24:10,532
そこにある幸せ 戦い手に入れる
The happiness that is right there,
I'll fight to get it

311
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:15,532
扉 開く その日まで
Until the day the door opens

312
00:24:16,232 --> 00:24:21,132
Your hope is more than just a place
You're never satisfied

313
00:24:21,632 --> 00:24:26,532
進む先は誰かに決められた道じゃなくて
The path ahead isn't one decided by
someone else

314
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:31,532
私のモノさ I want be born inside
It's mine, I want to be born inside

315
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:37,032
もう 戻れない
I can't go back anymore

316
00:24:39,032 --> 00:24:44,032
Believe that somehow we're alive

317
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,540
DONMAI

318
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,540
Hello again, my heat is over...

319
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,440
The tide is high but I'm still low...

320
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,040
You let the gala glamour me for me, babe
Cool and wild we can never be free, yeah

321
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,540
There is never any gold...

322
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,240
Hide and seek, take a peek at the skill no one could teach
A dance with the deuce that you know you'll never reach

323
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,040
Pickin' up on the wanna be somebody
A telephone fax and boys and girls, ready or not now boys and girls

324
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,040
High up on your throne, let it steady to the bone
Pumpin' in this midnight cold, oh-oh

325
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,040
People come and go, only way that you can grow
Is not to give a damn at all, oh-oh

326
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,540
FEEL THE DRIVE
When hell's breaking loose come and dance with me

327
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,540
FEEL THE VIBE
I know what I am and the right to believe

328
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,040
Can't catch up, I'm still in the fight...
Never say die but I tell myself

329
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,040
"DON'T MIND"
'Cause I'm betting all on me

330
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,440
Still here burning with desire, don't you tell me that you're tired
Are you joking, maybe joking, while I'm stoking up the fire

331
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,340
People say you lost your vision but you're seeing crystal clear
I'm making my own decision, don't you let me disappear

332
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:06,040
What do you want from me? Guess I'll never agree
Deep heavy body and a drama and it's all just meant to be

333
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:11,240
インターネット盛り上がってチリチリみたいになったトースター
絡まって空になって勝者、みんな舞って今夜
The internet is heated up like a toaster that's turned to ash
Tangled up and empty, the winner, everyone dance tonight

334
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,340
People come and go, only way that you can grow
Is not to give a damn at all, oh-oh

335
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,340
FEEL THE DRIVE
When hell's breaking loose come and dance with me

336
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:27,440
FEEL THE VIBE
I know what I am and the right to believe

337
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,040
Can't catch up, I'm still in the fight...
Never say die but I tell myself

338
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,240
"DON'T MIND"
'Cause I'm betting all on me

339
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,040
決めまくって回想、後に引きに引けない真相
巻き散らして喚き出して辺り散らし暴走
Deciding everything in a reminiscence, a truth that can't be taken back
Scattering about, screaming out, running wild all around

340
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,240
難船時、なんか分かんねぇ自尊心
後生大事に自分なりで我慢してる口頭
At the time of shipwreck, some unknown self-esteem
Cherishing it as if it's life itself, enduring in my own way, verbally

341
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,140
笑わせんな、聞きませんな、君のそのアジェンダ
Let it be known, I'm still here and I will never surrender
Don't make me laugh, I'm not listening to your agenda
Let it be known, I'm still here and I will never surrender

342
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,140
People come they go, there are highs and endless lows
Only way that you can grow is not to give a damn at all

343
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,140
Hello again, my heat is over...

344
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,140
The tide is high but I'm not alone...

345
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,540
FEEL THE DRIVE
When hell's breaking loose come and dance with me

346
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,540
FEEL THE VIBE
I know what I am and the right to believe

347
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,240
Can't catch up, I'm still in the fight...
Never say die but I tell myself

348
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:47,340
"DON'T MIND"
'Cause I'm betting all on me

349
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,340
"DON'T MIND"
'Cause I'm betting all on me

350
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:57,340
FEEL THE DRIVE
When hell's breaking loose come and dance with me

351
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:02,340
FEEL THE VIBE
I know what I am and the right to believe

352
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,040
Can't catch up, I'm still in the fight...
Never say die but I tell myself

353
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:13,140
"DON'T MIND"
'Cause I'm betting all on me

354
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,040
Taste of Death
Lyrics: Mori Calliope, KIRA
Music, Arrangement: KIRA

355
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:52,340
Ha, so bored of basic bread
I need a bigger track to satisfy what I crave

356
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:58,240
Ha, I heard you wanna play
My heels on your neck, come and try in this game

357
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,362
...got you in my sights right now, still alive.

358
00:30:01,362 --> 00:30:03,466
See now how I excite you, death's so the prize.

359
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:05,986
I'm still the best at making y'all cry.

360
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:08,778
But I'll get good, my, my.

361
00:30:10,748 --> 00:30:13,531
Watching you from the shadows where I wander

362
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:16,473
暗闇で fear making me stronger
Fear in the darkness is making me stronger

363
00:30:16,473 --> 00:30:19,381
死神が止まらないんだ
The Reaper won't stop

364
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:21,948
Very last breath, get a taste of death

365
00:30:21,948 --> 00:30:24,648
One by one fall into my trap

366
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:27,398
Desiring the touch of a maniac

367
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:30,193
This is how it feels on the edge, 君の the end
This is how it feels on the edge, your end

368
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:33,148
Take your very last breath for a taste of death

369
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:37,998
Okay, okay, okay, I gotta hold back this lust

370
00:30:37,998 --> 00:30:40,898
Vivid up bust, you can trust me, I got the stamina to be up with you all night

371
00:30:40,898 --> 00:30:43,814
Give me the runaround, I'm gonna chase you down till I pin you to the ground

372
00:30:43,814 --> 00:30:46,548
Slam my name, boy, it's my favorite sound

373
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:49,048
Da-da-da-da-da-die

374
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:51,348
Got you in my sights right now, still alive

375
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:53,648
See now how I excite you, death's so the prize

376
00:30:53,648 --> 00:30:56,248
I'm still the best at making y'all die

377
00:30:56,248 --> 00:30:58,748
Better get good, my, my

378
00:31:00,648 --> 00:31:03,248
Watching you from the shadows where I wander

379
00:31:03,248 --> 00:31:06,048
暗闇で fear making me stronger
Fear in the darkness is making me stronger

380
00:31:06,048 --> 00:31:08,848
死神が止まらないんだ
The Reaper won't stop

381
00:31:08,848 --> 00:31:11,648
Very last breath, get a taste of death

382
00:31:11,648 --> 00:31:14,348
One by one fall into my trap

383
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:17,048
Desiring the touch of a maniac

384
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:19,848
This is how it feels on the edge, 君の the end
This is how it feels on the edge, your end

385
00:31:19,848 --> 00:31:22,648
Take your very last breath for a taste of death

386
00:31:24,648 --> 00:31:27,248
I just can't wait

387
00:31:27,248 --> 00:31:29,848
To watch your heartbeat stop

388
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:32,648
Set my insides on fire

389
00:31:32,648 --> 00:31:35,348
Seeing your body drop

390
00:31:35,348 --> 00:31:36,486
Just us...

391
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:39,248
...one and fighting, come on inside and don't fight me

392
00:31:39,248 --> 00:31:42,048
Heart accelerates, screaming and biting, leave me shaking, aching, find it

393
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:44,748
Let yourself do me and take this body and use me

394
00:31:44,748 --> 00:31:47,348
While death consumes you, girl, I'll make you choose me

395
00:31:50,048 --> 00:31:52,848
Watching you from the shadows where I wander

396
00:31:52,848 --> 00:31:55,748
暗闇で fear making me stronger
Fear in the darkness is making me stronger

397
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:58,448
死神が止まらないんだ
The Reaper won't stop

398
00:31:58,448 --> 00:32:01,248
Very last breath, get a taste of death

399
00:32:01,248 --> 00:32:03,948
One by one fall into my trap

400
00:32:03,948 --> 00:32:06,648
Desiring the touch of a maniac

401
00:32:06,648 --> 00:32:09,548
This is how it feels on the edge, 君の the end
This is how it feels on the edge, your end

402
00:32:09,548 --> 00:32:12,348
Take your very last breath for a taste of death

403
00:32:15,848 --> 00:32:19,448
Take your very last breath, get a taste of death

404
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:25,648
Take your very last breath, get a taste of death

405
00:32:56,248 --> 00:33:00,048
Make 'Em Afraid

406
00:32:59,248 --> 00:33:01,648
Wait, a world was at my finger

407
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:02,548
Yeah

408
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:06,048
What now, stop running, you know me as the chick who won't back down

409
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,848
I'm coming, the girl who threatens your empire

410
00:33:08,848 --> 00:33:11,648
A fire, an urge to be bad

411
00:33:11,648 --> 00:33:14,348
You can expect to meet the angels that you had

412
00:33:16,448 --> 00:33:17,848
Now, the tables have turned

413
00:33:17,848 --> 00:33:20,348
The bridges are burned with desire for human applause

414
00:33:20,348 --> 00:33:23,048
Pause, rewind, relive and relay all the shit that I wanted to say

415
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:25,848
I beckon you all to be part of making it no more a start of...

416
00:33:25,848 --> 00:33:28,548
...the end

417
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:33,648
Humankind's God-sacred laws of voice to take them higher

418
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:36,548
Higher!

419
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,148
I've got delusions of your revolution

420
00:33:39,148 --> 00:33:41,848
Love dreams come true, love dreams come true

421
00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:43,048
Come on!

422
00:33:43,048 --> 00:33:45,648
Make 'em afraid of you

423
00:33:52,248 --> 00:33:54,848
Make 'em afraid of you

424
00:33:59,348 --> 00:34:01,148
Make 'em afraid of you

425
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:03,848
Because I'm the queen of fools, they see what they want and they're done

426
00:34:03,848 --> 00:34:06,548
Set the beast on the loose and make 'em afraid of you

427
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:09,348
Write it, I'll break the rules and even if you cannot find love

428
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:12,148
If you got the stuff to prove it, make 'em afraid of you

429
00:34:18,448 --> 00:34:21,048
Defy, I'm out of my mind

430
00:34:21,048 --> 00:34:23,848
Chasing a nice delight, feel the animal taking a bite

431
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:27,248
Revive, teeth, and cry out as I clench through the pain

432
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:30,048
They say there is nothing to change and my prayers are a gentle temper

433
00:34:30,048 --> 00:34:32,848
So liar, you think you're no good, don't act like I should

434
00:34:32,848 --> 00:34:35,648
The joke's on you, disguise the limit

435
00:34:38,348 --> 00:34:41,148
Guess my ambitions make my own decisions

436
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:44,048
Defying on the brink, watch the kingdom start to fall

437
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:49,248
Humankind's God-sacred laws of voice to take them higher

438
00:34:49,248 --> 00:34:52,048
Riding your rhythm, so make me your villain

439
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,848
Love dreams come true, love dreams come true

440
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,048
Come on!

441
00:34:56,048 --> 00:34:58,748
Make 'em afraid of you

442
00:35:02,906 --> 00:35:03,556
Hey!

443
00:35:05,456 --> 00:35:07,856
Na-na-na-na-na...

444
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:09,856
Make 'em afraid of ya.

445
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:16,856
Make 'em afraid of ya.

446
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,256
I'm just the queen of fools,

447
00:35:18,356 --> 00:35:20,256
Distill what they want it all.

448
00:35:20,356 --> 00:35:22,056
I've said to myself, no losing,

449
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:23,856
Make 'em afraid of ya.

450
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:25,256
Write it up, break some rules,

451
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,256
I'll never let go of my love.

452
00:35:27,356 --> 00:35:29,056
If you've got the stuff to prove it,

453
00:35:29,156 --> 00:35:30,856
Make 'em afraid of ya.

454
00:35:32,056 --> 00:35:33,556
Yeah, yeah!

455
00:35:35,056 --> 00:35:37,056
Ha...

456
00:35:37,156 --> 00:35:41,856
Goodbye to this vulnerable side,

457
00:35:42,356 --> 00:35:44,256
I watch as it burns to...

458
00:35:44,356 --> 00:35:45,356
Conclusion.

459
00:35:45,456 --> 00:35:46,856
Your revolution.

460
00:35:47,056 --> 00:35:48,056
Observation.

461
00:35:48,256 --> 00:35:50,356
Your misconstrued myth come true, come on!

462
00:35:50,556 --> 00:35:52,056
Make 'em afraid of ya.

463
00:35:54,056 --> 00:35:55,056
Hey!

464
00:35:56,856 --> 00:35:59,256
Na-na-na-na-na...

465
00:35:59,356 --> 00:36:01,056
Make 'em afraid of ya.

466
00:36:05,556 --> 00:36:07,556
Make 'em afraid of ya. Ow!

467
00:36:08,556 --> 00:36:10,056
I'm just the queen of fools,

468
00:36:10,156 --> 00:36:11,756
Distill what they want it all.

469
00:36:11,856 --> 00:36:13,256
I've said to myself, no losing,

470
00:36:13,356 --> 00:36:14,956
Make 'em afraid of ya.

471
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:16,756
Write it up, break some rules,

472
00:36:16,856 --> 00:36:18,456
I'll never let go of my love.

473
00:36:18,556 --> 00:36:20,156
If you've got the stuff to prove it,

474
00:36:20,256 --> 00:36:22,056
Make 'em afraid of ya.

475
00:36:22,256 --> 00:36:24,056
Make 'em afraid of ya.

476
00:36:53,056 --> 00:36:56,556
You're Not Special
Lyrics: Mori Calliope

477
00:36:56,556 --> 00:36:57,856
Where to begin...

478
00:36:58,356 --> 00:37:00,256
...in this wicked world?

479
00:37:00,556 --> 00:37:03,256
There's a million others just like you.

480
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,856
Yeah.

481
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:08,056
You talk too much, you're all out of touch,

482
00:37:08,256 --> 00:37:11,556
猿回しの猿になれない存在。
An existence that can't become a showman's monkey.

483
00:37:13,056 --> 00:37:14,856
You talk too much, you're all out of touch,

484
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:18,556
猿回しの猿になれない存在。
An existence that can't become a showman's monkey.

485
00:37:19,556 --> 00:37:22,356
Yeah, it's "anything goes" when you're forced to create while advancing on tiptoes.

486
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:23,956
Actually worthless, with no purpose,

487
00:37:24,056 --> 00:37:25,456
No place to face all your work.

488
00:37:25,556 --> 00:37:27,456
What's the point if you'll never return from this morphous?

489
00:37:27,556 --> 00:37:29,056
Enormous snore built in the bridges they burned.

490
00:37:29,156 --> 00:37:30,856
First getting supercilious smiles and waves,

491
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:32,456
The praise in the bonus to make sure you stay.

492
00:37:32,556 --> 00:37:36,556
So the story goes, you're the one they'll remember.

493
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:42,556
Lie, call it labors of love.

494
00:37:44,256 --> 00:37:45,356
Why put in the effort?

495
00:37:45,456 --> 00:37:48,056
'Cuz you're not special, none of us are,

496
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:51,056
Even those plagued by stardom fade into dust.

497
00:37:51,256 --> 00:37:53,856
Nothing matters, who the hell else should I be?

498
00:37:54,056 --> 00:37:56,556
A puppet, a pawn, if I fail I'm gone...

499
00:37:56,656 --> 00:37:58,156
...so everyone else can be happy.

500
00:37:58,256 --> 00:38:00,856
With no question, I fall in line,

501
00:38:01,056 --> 00:38:04,256
Believing promises every time.

502
00:38:04,556 --> 00:38:07,356
Soldier onwards, spare me your honesty,

503
00:38:07,556 --> 00:38:10,056
'Cuz I know my place now.

504
00:38:10,556 --> 00:38:13,556
A washed-out prophecy.

505
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:16,856
Out of sight, out of mind, we'll never see the same view.

506
00:38:17,056 --> 00:38:19,556
Lost, so exhausted, but you can't give in.

507
00:38:19,856 --> 00:38:22,556
Keep getting fired up, might forget the ones who saved you.

508
00:38:22,856 --> 00:38:25,556
There's no bias, and no-hopers never win.

509
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:31,556
So, we close our eyes and pretend that this might end right...

510
00:38:33,256 --> 00:38:37,056
...just a means to an end.

511
00:38:38,056 --> 00:38:39,056
Why put up a fight then?

512
00:38:39,256 --> 00:38:41,856
'Cuz you're not special, none of us are,

513
00:38:42,056 --> 00:38:44,856
Even those plagued by stardom fade into dust.

514
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:48,556
Nothing matters, how much more love can I spend?

515
00:38:49,056 --> 00:38:52,056
A puppet, a pawn, if I fail I'm gone so everyone fallen can ascend.

516
00:38:52,256 --> 00:38:54,856
With no question, I fall in line,

517
00:38:55,256 --> 00:38:58,056
And play my part so the chosen shine.

518
00:38:58,256 --> 00:39:00,856
Persona non grata, better left out of the sun,

519
00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:04,556
'Cuz I know my place now.

520
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:08,556
Just watching through the looking glass to the past as it comes to pass.

521
00:39:08,656 --> 00:39:12,556
A million eyes demand an outburst till their very last.

522
00:39:13,056 --> 00:39:15,856
Forget to find my whereabouts, my own way.

523
00:39:16,056 --> 00:39:19,056
Each moment passing is a debt I gotta pay.

524
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:21,856
And now just look me in the eye... (Yeah, yeah)

525
00:39:22,056 --> 00:39:24,056
...it's time that we realize. (Realize, realize)

526
00:39:24,556 --> 00:39:28,056
The non-existence of you, don't gotta cry.

527
00:39:28,556 --> 00:39:31,556
So set for me an enterprise, so you can never make it mine.

528
00:39:31,856 --> 00:39:35,556
So you can take it when it's over, leave nothing behind.

529
00:39:36,056 --> 00:39:41,056
So the story goes, you're the one they'll remember.

530
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:46,556
Lie, call it labors of love.

531
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:48,056
Why put in the effort?

532
00:39:48,256 --> 00:39:50,856
'Cuz you're not special, none of us are,

533
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,856
Even those plagued by stardom fade into dust.

534
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:56,856
Nothing matters, who the hell else should I be?

535
00:39:57,056 --> 00:40:00,056
A puppet, a pawn, if I fail I'm gone so everyone else can be happy.

536
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,364
...happy with no question,

537
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:03,264
I fall in line.

538
00:40:03,264 --> 00:40:06,064
Greedy promises every time.

539
00:40:06,064 --> 00:40:09,564
Soldier onward, spare me your honesty,

540
00:40:09,564 --> 00:40:13,064
'Cause I know my place now...

541
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:18,064
A washed out prophecy.

542
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:18,064
A WASHED OUT PROPHECY

543
00:40:53,064 --> 00:40:55,164
I am the picture of a perfect human every day.

544
00:40:55,164 --> 00:40:57,864
I am the picture of a perfect human every day.

545
00:40:58,264 --> 00:41:08,064
Whoa...

546
00:40:58,564 --> 00:41:05,064
Black Sheep

547
00:41:11,064 --> 00:41:13,064
I am the picture of a perfect human every day,

548
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:15,864
and I kinda got nothing left for making mistakes.

549
00:41:16,064 --> 00:41:18,464
I am the notorious stain on my life,

550
00:41:18,464 --> 00:41:21,064
'cause I got what's on the mannequin with no right to complain.

551
00:41:21,264 --> 00:41:23,764
I'm a masterpiece born on some days I can't get up.

552
00:41:23,764 --> 00:41:26,164
If I showed a better way, this yet I don't think you would let up.

553
00:41:26,164 --> 00:41:27,564
Numbers pressing me, pinning me down,

554
00:41:27,564 --> 00:41:29,364
I won't let you see me frown.

555
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:31,564
Reality is drowning, someone see me now.

556
00:41:32,064 --> 00:41:34,064
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na...

557
00:41:34,064 --> 00:41:36,564
この世界に全く意味ない
There's no meaning in this world at all.

558
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:39,164
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na...

559
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,564
死んじゃっていい
It's okay to die.

560
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:43,964
Feeling like the pens run out at last,

561
00:41:43,964 --> 00:41:46,464
living like a moth beneath the glass.

562
00:41:46,464 --> 00:41:48,864
Ever just a slave into my past,

563
00:41:48,864 --> 00:41:50,564
I just laugh.

564
00:41:54,464 --> 00:41:58,664
If you retreat now, this life will never change.

565
00:41:59,064 --> 00:42:01,864
Just like lyrics you've heard a thousand times.

566
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:04,664
Tired and inspired brief refrains.

567
00:42:05,164 --> 00:42:09,164
Stay on repeat loud, my mind am I deranged?

568
00:42:10,064 --> 00:42:14,364
When I can hear the bridges setting in my heart again,

569
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:16,464
I swear I'm gonna break the chain!

570
00:42:16,464 --> 00:42:18,864
We're living in the upside down now!

571
00:42:18,864 --> 00:42:21,164
We're living in the upside down.

572
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,764
We're living in the upside down now!

573
00:42:23,764 --> 00:42:26,264
We're living in the upside down.

574
00:42:26,464 --> 00:42:28,564
Some call it niche, others call it just unlikable,

575
00:42:28,564 --> 00:42:30,864
but this here is an art form, others are recyclable.

576
00:42:30,864 --> 00:42:33,264
I'm breaking for row, set out I won't be controlled.

577
00:42:33,264 --> 00:42:35,764
My hand is stronger than ever and yet I fold.

578
00:42:36,064 --> 00:42:38,264
No-no-no, no time for falling, and my exploited head is so tall and I'm...

579
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,564
defenseless, expendable, pretending that I'm dependable.

580
00:42:40,564 --> 00:42:43,064
Don't look, don't belong near my own friends, there's no end.

581
00:42:43,064 --> 00:42:45,364
Nothing's getting better, so I'm thinking of pushing and pulling

582
00:42:45,364 --> 00:42:47,864
myself and seeing how far I bet, pray.

583
00:42:49,464 --> 00:42:51,564
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na...

584
00:42:51,564 --> 00:42:54,064
この世界で生きたくない
I don't want to live in this world.

585
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:56,564
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na...

586
00:42:56,564 --> 00:42:59,064
死んじゃっていい
It's okay to die.

587
00:42:59,064 --> 00:43:01,464
Feeling like there's nothing left to write,

588
00:43:01,464 --> 00:43:03,864
living like I'm running out of time.

589
00:43:03,864 --> 00:43:06,264
Ever losing sleep wondering why,

590
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:08,264
I can't die.

591
00:43:11,864 --> 00:43:16,064
逃げ出した人生は変わらない
A life you ran away from doesn't change.

592
00:43:16,364 --> 00:43:18,864
何回聞いたことがある
How many times have I heard that?

593
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:21,264
歌詞、戯言は要らないね
Lyrics, I don't need your nonsense.

594
00:43:22,064 --> 00:43:26,564
I really need you now though life may never change.

595
00:43:26,764 --> 00:43:29,864
I want to scream how I feel until I'm gone.

596
00:43:30,064 --> 00:43:32,464
Resonance of empty outrage,

597
00:43:32,464 --> 00:43:35,464
days of deep losses always stay the page.

598
00:43:35,464 --> 00:43:40,464
So I'll create it and I'm dying at the middle of my heart again.

599
00:43:40,464 --> 00:43:43,064
Tonight I'm gonna break the chain!

600
00:43:44,264 --> 00:43:46,564
We're living in the upside down now!

601
00:43:46,564 --> 00:43:49,064
We're living in the upside down.

602
00:43:49,064 --> 00:43:51,364
We're living in the upside down now!

603
00:43:51,364 --> 00:43:53,764
We're living in the upside down.

604
00:43:54,564 --> 00:43:56,864
I am the picture of a perfect human every day.

605
00:43:56,864 --> 00:44:00,064
I am the picture of a perfect human every day.

606
00:44:05,214 --> 00:44:06,464
Woo! Woo! Woo!

607
00:44:05,864 --> 00:44:06,864
Welcome!

608
00:44:06,864 --> 00:44:08,564
Thank you IRyS, thank you Bae!

609
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:10,564
It's my birthday, it's my birthday!

610
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,564
I am the picture of a perfect human every day!

611
00:44:12,564 --> 00:44:13,864
It's my birthday!

612
00:44:14,064 --> 00:44:18,064
I am the picture of a perfect human every day!

613
00:44:19,464 --> 00:44:21,064
Okay you fools!

614
00:44:21,864 --> 00:44:26,064
Hey, it's my birthday! Thank you for coming to celebrate my birthday in my crystal ball!

615
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,264
My crystal ball, welcome! What do you guys think?

616
00:44:28,564 --> 00:44:29,264
Whoa! Whoa!

617
00:44:29,364 --> 00:44:33,264
You're like a... what do you call it? One of those mysterious fortune tellers!

618
00:44:33,364 --> 00:44:34,564
Yeah, fortune teller, yep!

619
00:44:34,664 --> 00:44:38,264
Well, there's a little problem though. I haven't figured out how to get out of here.

620
00:44:38,364 --> 00:44:39,564
So we're stuck? What about us?

621
00:44:40,464 --> 00:44:42,364
Uh... yeah, you guys are gonna have to figure it out in a little bit.

622
00:44:42,564 --> 00:44:44,264
We came out of a tarot card... carrot? Tarot card?

623
00:44:44,364 --> 00:44:45,364
Carrot?

624
00:44:45,364 --> 00:44:46,564
Carrot? Carrot card?

625
00:44:46,664 --> 00:44:47,864
Tarot card! We came out of a tarot card!

626
00:44:49,164 --> 00:44:51,264
Surely we can just go back to the tarot card?

627
00:44:51,364 --> 00:44:54,364
Nah, it's a... it's a one-way trip, ladies, sorry. I didn't think that far.

628
00:44:55,264 --> 00:44:56,564
Time to start the MC part!

629
00:44:56,564 --> 00:44:56,864
Yay!

630
00:44:56,964 --> 00:45:00,064
No no no, you guys... I'm sure that you'll find your way back.

631
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,172
I'll lay it out in a little bit, but right now

632
00:45:02,172 --> 00:45:04,972
I wanted to introduce you guys to the crowd.
Guys, jikoshoukai!
I wanted to introduce you guys to the crowd.
Guys, introduce yourselves!

633
00:45:06,197 --> 00:45:09,572
HiRyS! It's IRyS from Hololive English!
Your Seiso Nephilim here to bring hope,

634
00:45:12,622 --> 00:45:15,572
and I am the positive energy

635
00:45:15,572 --> 00:45:19,522
in the Wheel of Fortune card thingy
that we're a part of.

636
00:45:19,522 --> 00:45:22,572
Is that what you think?
Is that your... is that your guestimate?

637
00:45:22,572 --> 00:45:24,572
Okay. Yeah, 'cause it's helping Chaos, obviously!

638
00:45:25,572 --> 00:45:28,172
Obviously! Hope is like, you know, the good stuff!

639
00:45:28,172 --> 00:45:31,022
Right? Okay, that's a guess.

640
00:45:31,022 --> 00:45:34,072
And so this is the bad stuff over here?
Is that what you're trying to say?

641
00:45:34,622 --> 00:45:37,522
Hey, not me! That's her!
She said it! She said it, not me!

642
00:45:37,522 --> 00:45:40,572
I did! That's right! I'm bad! Chaos is bad!

643
00:45:43,122 --> 00:45:45,172
She's bad! What's up!

644
00:45:45,722 --> 00:45:47,922
I am Chaos, the end of ends,

645
00:45:47,922 --> 00:45:50,122
a doomsday rat trapped in a cage of ice...

646
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,572
Gill-best-friend... I just... Oh my god,
I'm like, drooling, help!

647
00:45:53,022 --> 00:45:56,172
I'm Hakos Baelz from Hololive English!
Witness me!

648
00:45:56,622 --> 00:45:59,072
Witness! Witness! Witness!

649
00:46:00,122 --> 00:46:01,922
So am I the... am I the bad side?

650
00:46:01,922 --> 00:46:04,572
There's no such thing as 'bad side'
in Wheel of Fortune, you guys.

651
00:46:04,622 --> 00:46:07,572
Wheel of Fortune is like gacha, right?
And if you get like a good result...

652
00:46:08,622 --> 00:46:12,022
And then if you get like the bad...
there is no such thing as bad result!

653
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:13,572
It's Chaos!

654
00:46:13,622 --> 00:46:15,922
You guys want to know the real...
the wheel reason...

655
00:46:16,522 --> 00:46:18,522
The real reason... the wheel reason...

656
00:46:19,522 --> 00:46:21,572
The real reason... Stop it, stop it,
stop it, omaera!
The real reason... Stop it, stop it,
stop it, you guys!

657
00:46:22,622 --> 00:46:25,572
Okay, the reason that I chose you guys
for Wheel of Fortune is because

658
00:46:25,572 --> 00:46:28,172
I'm so fortunate to have met you both
in my life.

659
00:46:28,622 --> 00:46:32,022
Aww! Oh my god!

660
00:46:42,622 --> 00:46:45,572
Yeah, but seriously, you guys' guesses
were pretty good too. I don't know,

661
00:46:45,572 --> 00:46:48,572
you guys just seemed very Wheel of Fortune-esque,
so that's why I chose you guys.

662
00:46:48,622 --> 00:46:50,572
Wheel of Fortune, I see.

663
00:46:50,622 --> 00:46:52,572
So, what did you guys think about
performing together? Was it fun?

664
00:46:52,622 --> 00:46:55,172
I loved it! That was so much fun!

665
00:46:55,722 --> 00:46:58,572
Yeah! Me too! I'm a picture
of a perfect human every day!

666
00:47:02,622 --> 00:47:04,572
Yes! And performing was so much fun!

667
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:07,572
I love how whenever the camera went
to each of you guys,

668
00:47:07,572 --> 00:47:10,572
you could see your personality.
Like Baelz... she's just like...

669
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:15,572
And then IRyS is like smiling and cute,
like... like idol!

670
00:47:15,572 --> 00:47:18,572
Like my diva, my diva, my princess.

671
00:47:19,622 --> 00:47:22,572
Yeah, I love that, I love that so much.

672
00:47:22,622 --> 00:47:24,572
I'm seiso!

673
00:47:24,622 --> 00:47:27,572
Yeah, it's very cute. It made my heart
go like 'ba-bump'.

674
00:47:27,622 --> 00:47:30,572
My friends are so cool singing it, though!

675
00:47:30,622 --> 00:47:33,572
Like, yeah! (Singing) I'm a picture
of a perfect human every day!

676
00:47:34,622 --> 00:47:36,172
So cool!

677
00:47:36,172 --> 00:47:38,572
Get into your feelings, you know?
この世界いつも...
Get into your feelings, you know?
Kono sekai itsumo...

678
00:47:38,572 --> 00:47:40,572
...僕ら食らってんだ!
...bokura kurattenda!

679
00:47:40,572 --> 00:47:41,572
死んだっていい!
Shindatte ii!

680
00:47:41,622 --> 00:47:45,022
Yeah! You can die, that's cool,
but not yet, not yet!

681
00:47:45,072 --> 00:47:48,572
Not unless you die striving trying
to find your way out of here.

682
00:47:48,572 --> 00:47:50,572
But I'm not going to help you guys.
You have to do that yourself.

683
00:47:50,622 --> 00:47:52,572
Time... time to go bye-bye!

684
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:54,572
Okay! Okay! We're being kicked out!

685
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:56,172
But how do we get way?

686
00:47:56,172 --> 00:47:58,572
I'll look this way. Okay, let's see.

687
00:47:58,622 --> 00:48:00,572
I'm pretty sure there's like an NPC around here...

688
00:48:00,622 --> 00:48:02,172
Wait! Let's zoom out this way!

689
00:48:02,172 --> 00:48:04,572
Good luck! Give us a countdown!

690
00:48:04,622 --> 00:48:06,172
Are you ready? Like a race queen!

691
00:48:06,172 --> 00:48:08,572
Three, two, one, pyun!
Three, two, one, zoom!

692
00:48:08,622 --> 00:48:10,572
Off to the races they go!

693
00:48:10,622 --> 00:48:13,022
Those two are maximum silliness.

694
00:48:13,622 --> 00:48:16,172
Anyway, I had to kick them out because

695
00:48:16,172 --> 00:48:18,572
guess what guys? It's my birthday!

696
00:48:18,622 --> 00:48:20,572
Which means that...

697
00:48:20,622 --> 00:48:22,572
ah, there is merchandise.

698
00:48:22,622 --> 00:48:25,572
There is merchandise and goods for you guys,

699
00:48:25,622 --> 00:48:28,572
so check it out, okay? I will introduce
each merch item at one time.

700
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:32,022
Hope you guys are ready. There is some
limited stuff this time,

701
00:48:32,022 --> 00:48:34,572
so hope you guys are ready to grab them
real quick. Now, first up is...

702
00:48:32,072 --> 00:48:36,072
Birthday Celebration 2025

703
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,572
Mystical Songstress... oh wait,
hold on a second.

704
00:48:39,622 --> 00:48:42,572
First of all, take a look at all of this.

705
00:48:42,622 --> 00:48:45,572
There's a mystical song... mystical songstress poster...

706
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,572
I'm sorry, I don't know where I'm looking ever,
any time, any second of the day.

707
00:48:48,622 --> 00:48:51,572
This is a poster. I know you guys like posters,

708
00:48:51,622 --> 00:48:54,572
so it was recommended to me this time,

709
00:48:54,622 --> 00:48:57,572
let's do a poster that features the main
key visual of the merchandise.

710
00:48:57,622 --> 00:49:00,572
It is drawn by Kuno Norari-sensei.
Arigatou gozaimasu! Thank you so much!
It is drawn by Kuno Norari-sensei.
Thank you so much! Thank you so much!

711
00:49:00,622 --> 00:49:03,572
Second is Lucky Dead Beat's Random Rubber Strap.

712
00:49:03,622 --> 00:49:06,572
You can get one random design out of
four possible designs.

713
00:49:06,622 --> 00:49:09,572
The illustration is by Keijo-sensei.

714
00:49:09,622 --> 00:49:12,572
There are lots of different outfits,

715
00:49:12,622 --> 00:49:15,572
and so I don't know, if you want, you can
try to collect all four.

716
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:18,572
You know, I'm pretty sure that you can
grab them separate,

717
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,572
so try to get all of them, okay? Yes, yes.

718
00:49:21,622 --> 00:49:24,572
Now, the third item is... I know you guys
have been waiting for this...

719
00:49:24,622 --> 00:49:27,572
Underworld University Sweater!

720
00:49:27,622 --> 00:49:30,572
The same design as my recently released
new outfit. Kawaii, right?
The same design as my recently released
new outfit. Cute, right?

721
00:49:30,622 --> 00:49:33,572
Kawaii. You can wear the same sweater
that I do. Yatta!
Cute. You can wear the same sweater
that I do. Yay!

722
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:36,572
Hope you guys grab it, it's very comfy.

723
00:49:36,622 --> 00:49:39,572
Now next up, fourth is... Stay HYDRATED!
Water Bottle, okay?

724
00:49:39,622 --> 00:49:42,572
You can use this when heading off to work
or traveling.

725
00:49:42,622 --> 00:49:45,572
You know, Dead Beats, we love to drink water,

726
00:49:45,622 --> 00:49:48,572
despite the fact that a lot of you guys
are skeletons, you still need water, right?

727
00:49:48,622 --> 00:49:51,572
To live. I mean, that's just... those are the rules.

728
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:54,572
I don't make them. So make sure that
you stay hydrated

729
00:49:54,622 --> 00:49:57,572
with your special Mori Calliope water bottle.
It's very subtle.

730
00:49:57,622 --> 00:50:00,072
Nobody'll know that you're like... that you're like a big Holo fan...

731
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:08,080
STAY HYDRATED! ボトル
STAY HYDRATED! Bottle

732
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,380
All of fans will know...

733
00:50:01,446 --> 00:50:05,980
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do these days,
so hope you guys enjoy.

734
00:50:06,213 --> 00:50:08,080
Fifth item is...

735
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:13,280
Situational Voice, "The Fortune I Got
from the Dark Forest Songstress".

736
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:26,080
Voice Pack / シチュエーションボイス
「暗き森の歌姫からの加護」(日本語＆英語)
Voice Pack / Situational Voice Pack
"The Fortune I Got from the Dark Forest Songstress" (Japanese & English)

737
00:50:13,813 --> 00:50:20,180
It sounds so silly, it's like maximum freaking
silliness, like some kind of isekai anime title.

738
00:50:20,346 --> 00:50:24,780
I hope you guys enjoy it. I think it's very cute
and fits the theme of the main illustration.

739
00:50:25,546 --> 00:50:27,780
Also, if you buy the full set...

740

Complete Set Purchase Bonus / Full Set Purchase Bonus

741
00:50:27,946 --> 00:50:33,780
...for a limited number of orders, you could get
the hand-autographed postcard, RIP Mori's hand.

742
00:50:33,946 --> 00:50:39,813
But there actually aren't many this time
because, you know, RIP Mori's hand.

743
00:50:39,946 --> 00:50:43,146
I gotta watch out for my hand health,
and I'm very busy.

744
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,046
So make sure that you grab yours,
they're in very limited supply, okay?

745
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:50,080
For the normal set, there is a
foil-stamped postcard included instead.

746
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:53,113
And this was drawn by Kunono Rari-sensei,
thank you so much again.

747
00:50:53,080 --> 00:51:38,080

So, with that being said everybody, we still
have a little bit more of the show to go.

759
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,046
Are you guys ready to continue?

760
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,280
Let's keep having lots of fun because we
still got a couple performances left.

761
00:51:49,413 --> 00:51:51,180
Okay? Are you guys watching?

762
00:51:51,346 --> 00:51:55,580
It's about to get even crazier! Let's go!

763
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:29,580
Ouroboros
Lyrics: Mori Calliope, Elliot Hsu

764
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:33,480
In ages forgotten a reaper was born

765
00:52:33,613 --> 00:52:37,413
Spinning tales of deadly belief

766
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:42,146
A yearning to traverse that forest of thorns

767
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,413
In remembrance of what lie beneath

768
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,446
The dangers abounding, the Ouroboros untold

769
00:52:50,613 --> 00:52:54,413
Cloud my vision until I cannot see

770
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:58,413
Peculiar enchantments begin to unfold

771
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:02,513
And the underworld calls back to me

772
00:53:06,713 --> 00:53:11,013
As the light grows dimmer and fades

773
00:53:14,746 --> 00:53:19,046
Cross that river now, make our way beyond the gates

774
00:53:19,213 --> 00:53:23,046
Release from our confinement, together we'll find it

775
00:53:23,213 --> 00:53:27,046
The trail is fraught with perils and yet we don't mind it

776
00:53:27,213 --> 00:53:31,146
But looking towards horizons, reminding me of then

777
00:53:31,313 --> 00:53:35,113
Can't repent, though I've hardly been spent

778
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,146
A journey downward towards somewhere new yet familiar

779
00:53:39,313 --> 00:53:43,113
I'm learning how to stand for the smile I swore to defend

780
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,146
Till the end, as we further descend then shall we go

781
00:53:47,313 --> 00:53:52,480
To be swallowed by fates below

782
00:54:07,513 --> 00:54:12,446
A moment in history, a flicker in time

783
00:54:12,613 --> 00:54:16,480
A mystery I still can't break through

784
00:54:16,646 --> 00:54:20,480
I'm deathly defiant of crossing that line

785
00:54:20,646 --> 00:54:24,480
I don't want to break down before you

786
00:54:24,646 --> 00:54:28,546
Reach downward to glory, yet upward what for?

787
00:54:28,713 --> 00:54:32,413
An Ouroboros of earthly desire

788
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:36,480
Devouring my tail just to tell it once more

789
00:54:36,646 --> 00:54:40,480
Am I still the gold statue you admire?

790
00:55:01,288 --> 00:55:03,588
Collecting all the stories with a joy

791
00:55:04,288 --> 00:55:07,588
And reflecting on the thorns that near destroyed me

792
00:55:08,588 --> 00:55:11,588
I sing about a journey's end and now we come upon

793
00:55:12,588 --> 00:55:16,088
Another one, the sun setting earlier than believed

794
00:55:17,588 --> 00:55:20,588
From this point downward I cannot return

795
00:55:21,088 --> 00:55:25,088
With a final dream I sought, it's so close yet far within my reach

796
00:55:26,588 --> 00:55:29,888
Though I'd like it to be known this time it's on my own

797
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:36,588
Release from our confinement, together we'll find it

798
00:55:37,088 --> 00:55:41,088
The trail is fraught with perils and maybe all is as it should be

799
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,888
I promise I'll still be me

800
00:55:45,588 --> 00:55:48,588
My mistakes somehow made a good story great

801
00:55:49,288 --> 00:55:53,088
A journey downward toward somewhere new yet familiar

802
00:55:54,088 --> 00:55:57,288
I'm learning how to stand for this smile I swore to defend

803
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:03,088
Till the end as we further descend then shall we go

804
00:56:03,588 --> 00:56:08,088
Swallowed up by what waits below

805
00:56:37,588 --> 00:56:41,588
Mina-san! What did you guys think about our performance today?

806
00:56:42,088 --> 00:56:43,588
Oh my gosh, it was so fun!

807
00:56:44,088 --> 00:56:46,588
Hey, wait a minute though, it's not over yet, so don't leave, don't leave!

808
00:56:46,888 --> 00:56:50,088
Don't run away to go get the limited merch or anything like that.

809
00:56:50,288 --> 00:56:52,588
It's not time yet, because we still have a little bit more to go.

810
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:55,588
You guys are gonna miss the grand finale, so just stay right there!

811
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,088
But, um, yeah, no, this show was amazing.

812
00:56:59,288 --> 00:57:03,288
We didn't have a lot of MCs, but that's because, you know, we were working hard to perform for you guys.

813
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:07,588
And look at all these tarot cards that we have here of me and all of my friends together.

814
00:57:08,588 --> 00:57:11,288
You know, I wanted to celebrate Hololive original songs, especially by Mori this time.

815
00:57:12,088 --> 00:57:16,588
I'm a big believer in like, "Let's go, Hololive original music!"

816
00:57:17,088 --> 00:57:22,088
And I wanted to celebrate all of that with you guys today by singing some of my favorite songs by me together with my friends.

817
00:57:23,088 --> 00:57:26,588
And so I hope that you guys were able to enjoy today's show.

818
00:57:27,288 --> 00:57:30,088
And take a look at this stage! Isn't the stage amazing?

819
00:57:30,288 --> 00:57:33,288
I know that we looked at it a little bit earlier before, but I mean, it's basically like a dream venue for me.

820
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:37,588
So sparkly and beautiful, oh my gosh.

821
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:42,088
It's been so amazing, and getting to explore all the different tarot cards as well with you guys.

822
00:57:43,088 --> 00:57:46,088
Because you know, as you know, "The Arcana is the means by which all is revealed."

823
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:51,588
And so I hope that you guys had some fun getting to kind of like, see my choices of songs,

824
00:57:51,588 --> 00:57:54,588
like who I chose to sing in each song and stuff like that.

825
00:57:56,588 --> 00:58:00,088
But we gotta move right along, we gotta move right along.

826
00:58:01,088 --> 00:58:04,588
Because, as you may have noticed, a special premiere has showed up on my channel.

827
00:58:05,588 --> 00:58:08,088
And our last guest might have something to do with that.

828
00:58:08,588 --> 00:58:11,288
This is a performance I'm very excited about.

829
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:16,588
Um, I gotta go change really quickly, but in the meantime, let's go ahead and summon one more person to the stage!

830
00:58:17,588 --> 00:58:22,088
Are you guys ready? Without further ado, here we go! よいしょ！
Are you guys ready? Without further ado, here we go! Here we go!

831
00:58:34,088 --> 00:58:38,588
皆さーん、最後のゲストはなんと、TOOBOEさんです！
Okay, everyone, here's our final guest. It's TOOBOE-san!

832
00:58:38,888 --> 00:58:41,088
よろしくお願いします。よろしくお願いします。
Great to be here. Great to be here.

833
00:58:41,288 --> 00:58:43,588
よろしくお願いします。はじめまして、はじめましてです。
Great to have you! Nice to meet you, yeah.

834
00:58:44,288 --> 00:58:47,088
はじめまして。見てる方には、そうですね、
Nice to meet you. I guess this would be my first time greeting

835
00:58:47,088 --> 00:58:49,888
はじめましての方が多いかなと思います。よろしくお願いします。
most of your viewers? It's a pleasure to be here.

836
00:58:50,088 --> 00:58:51,588
はい、よろしくお願いします。
And it's a pleasure to have you.

837
00:58:51,888 --> 00:58:55,588
実は、あの、TOOBOEさんは、去年のカリオペの
Believe it or not, TOOBOE-san, you were my

838
00:58:55,588 --> 00:59:00,088
Spotifyで一番よく聴いてたアーティストだったんですけど。
most listened to artist on Spotify last year.

839
00:59:00,588 --> 00:59:02,588
ありがとうございます、本当に。
Thank you so much.

840
00:59:03,088 --> 00:59:07,888
いえいえ、こちらこそ。ホロライブに入る前ずっとファンですから。
No, thank you. I've been a fan of yours since before I joined Hololive, even.

841
00:59:08,288 --> 00:59:09,588
へえ、本当に。
Really?

842
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,288
本当に嬉しいですね。
I'm so happy to have you here.

843
00:59:11,588 --> 00:59:13,288
いや、こちらこそ恐縮ですね。
Please, you flatter me.

844
00:59:13,588 --> 00:59:17,588
はい。そうですね、あのTOOBOEさんの曲は、本当にかっこいいと思う、マジで。
I think your songs are really cool. For real.

845
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:21,088
なんかメロディのセンスが、やばいです。本当に。
Your taste in melodies is actually crazy.

846
00:59:21,288 --> 00:59:22,588
ありがとうございます。
Thank you.

847
00:59:22,888 --> 00:59:28,088
はい。そうですね。そして、負け犬の話がすごく好きだから、リリックもめちゃくちゃ面白いと思うんで、
And I love a good underdog story, so your lyrics really hit home, too.

848
00:59:28,288 --> 00:59:31,088
一緒に曲作りたいなと思いました。
It really made me want to work on a song with you.

849
00:59:31,588 --> 00:59:35,088
ありがとうございます。ぜひ、楽しかったです、本当に。
Thank you. Working with you was a lot of fun.

850
00:59:35,288 --> 00:59:36,588
よかった。ありがとうございます。
I'm glad it was. Thank you.

851
00:59:37,088 --> 00:59:41,288
そして、私とTOOBOEさんは、ちょっと共通点があるんだけど、
What's more, TOOBOE-san and I have something in common.

852
00:59:42,088 --> 00:59:45,588
将来の夢は漫画家だった。
We both dreamed of being manga artists.

853
00:59:46,088 --> 00:59:48,588
あ、そうですね、そうですね。
Oh yeah, that's right.

854
00:59:49,088 --> 00:59:52,588
だから今回アニメーションミュージックビデオを作ろうかなと思いました。
That's why we thought we should make an animated music video for this one.

855
00:59:53,088 --> 00:59:54,088
はい。
Right.

856
00:59:54,288 --> 00:59:57,088
今回キャラクターデザインはカリオペとTOOBOEさん。
TOOBOE-san and I designed the characters.

857
00:59:57,288 --> 00:59:58,088
はい。
Right.

858
00:59:58,288 --> 01:00:00,088
アニメーションはカリオペでした。そうなんですね。
And I made the animation. Is that so?

859
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:01,926
そうですよね。何かあれですよね。
That's right. It's, like,

860
01:00:01,926 --> 01:00:04,396
僕あんまり、あの、絵柄が多分相当違うものなので、
our art styles are really different,

861
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:07,526
どうしようかなと思ったんですけど。
so I was wondering how we would do this.

862
01:00:07,526 --> 01:00:11,526
せっかくならお互いの良さ出せるようなアニメ作れればいいなってことで。
But we decided to aim for an anime MV that'd showcase both of our styles.

863
01:00:11,526 --> 01:00:15,956
僕もちょっと全体の話のプロットとかも考えましたし、
I worked with you on the overall plot and story,

864
01:00:15,956 --> 01:00:20,896
キャラもちょっと1体か2体描かせていただいて、
and designed a couple of characters.

865
01:00:20,896 --> 01:00:22,996
成りましたね。はい。
And it all came together.

866
01:00:23,096 --> 01:00:23,996
はい。
Yeah.

867
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:30,026
なかなか面白いMVになりましたから、皆さんぜひこの後チェックしてほしい。
Yeah, it's quite an fun and entertaining music video, so please check it out, guys.

868
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:31,226
はい。ありがとうございます。
Thank you very much.

869
01:00:31,226 --> 01:00:32,026
ありがとうございます。
Thank you.

870
01:00:32,026 --> 01:00:35,496
じゃあ、どんな曲を作ったかな？
I bet everyone's wondering what the song is like.

871
01:00:35,496 --> 01:00:39,626
皆さんに聴かせましょう。
So let's have them listen to it!

872
01:00:39,626 --> 01:00:41,326
はい。行くぞ！
Yeah. Okay, here we go!

873
01:01:00,096 --> 01:01:03,096
皆さん、これは最後の曲です。
Everyone, this is the last song.

874
01:01:03,096 --> 01:01:07,096
TOOBOE x Calliope 新曲 "Sepia" Check it out!
TOOBOE x Calliope new song "Sepia". Check it out.

875
01:01:08,096 --> 01:01:18,096
Sepia feat. TOOBOE
Lyrics: Mori Calliope, TOOBOE / Music, Arrangement: TOOBOE

876
01:01:19,563 --> 01:01:21,897
誤解しないで、滑稽だな
Don't misunderstand, it's laughable

877
01:01:22,131 --> 01:01:24,464
察せ、毒され Everyday
How time flashes by every day

878
01:01:24,564 --> 01:01:26,829
誰も化かせない、運命の囚人
Another prisoner of fate no one could fake out

879
01:01:26,929 --> 01:01:29,129
Stay awake now, you know you wanna fire away

880
01:01:29,162 --> 01:01:31,529
もう責任なんてないさ
Now there's no question where the fault lies

881
01:01:31,529 --> 01:01:33,829
共鳴さえできない毎日
These days I struggle just to empathize

882
01:01:33,862 --> 01:01:37,962
もう戻らないって、解っているんだろう
There's no going back, and you know that

883
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:41,129
Cast a blessing on my cursed role

884
01:01:41,129 --> 01:01:43,396
And feed this bleeding egotistical soul

885
01:01:43,429 --> 01:01:46,662
Before you know it, it's the moment you've lost all control

886
01:01:47,396 --> 01:01:50,929
時日の夢を見るたび
Every time I dream of days gone by

887
01:01:50,929 --> 01:01:55,662
生まれた意味を考えてしまうのさ
I wonder why I came to be

888
01:01:55,662 --> 01:02:00,029
嗚呼、美しき蒼い日々だな
Ah, such beautiful, youthful days

889
01:02:00,062 --> 01:02:04,462
この目に焼き付けておこうかな
I should burn their images into my mind

890
01:02:04,496 --> 01:02:08,629
もう少し強くならないとな
But I'd have to be a little stronger first

891
01:02:16,129 --> 01:02:18,529
嫉妬のセットにまみれた
Dripping in jealousy that's a bit too daring

892
01:02:18,562 --> 01:02:20,896
ちょっと足りないエクスタシー
An ecstasy that's just a little bit lacking

893
01:02:20,929 --> 01:02:25,362
迎えも解けないまま、他人傷つけて
I hurt somebody without ever opening my eyes

894
01:02:25,796 --> 01:02:28,229
当然、才すら無いわ
But there's no talent here, it's clear to see

895
01:02:28,229 --> 01:02:30,662
転がり落ちたイカサマのダイス
The rigged dice falls and rolls

896
01:02:30,662 --> 01:02:34,596
貴方の愛に気付けないまま
Before I ever notice your love and affection

897
01:02:35,229 --> 01:02:37,429
Cast a blessing on my cursed heart

898
01:02:37,429 --> 01:02:39,629
Why keep me breathing while it's falling apart?

899
01:02:39,662 --> 01:02:43,096
どうか、神様、教えてくれ
Pray tell me, God

900
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:47,696
言葉少なに貴方に捧ぐ
I give to you silently

901
01:02:47,696 --> 01:02:52,362
今にも消えてしまいそうなこの命を
My life that's about to burn out

902
01:02:52,362 --> 01:02:56,896
愛おしいセピア色した
Ah, and these sepia-toned

903
01:02:56,896 --> 01:03:01,429
何より大事なこの景色を
Sights, most precious of all

904
01:03:01,429 --> 01:03:04,196
もう少し見ていたいよな
That I wish I could watch some more

905
01:03:04,329 --> 01:03:06,496
I'm always gonna be my own worst enemy

906
01:03:06,496 --> 01:03:08,829
Everything I ever wanted was in front of me

907
01:03:08,829 --> 01:03:11,229
The angels on my shoulder still cannot agree

908
01:03:11,229 --> 01:03:13,462
If I was somebody else, could I get everything?

909
01:03:13,462 --> 01:03:15,562
I'm always gonna be my own worst enemy

910
01:03:15,562 --> 01:03:17,896
Everything I ever wanted was in front of me

911
01:03:17,896 --> 01:03:20,196
The devils on my shoulder never let me be

912
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,396
Obsessing over tomorrows that I'll never see

913
01:03:22,396 --> 01:03:24,796
Somebody save me

914
01:03:24,796 --> 01:03:27,162
My world is caving in 'cause I thought I deserved it all for free

915
01:03:27,162 --> 01:03:30,629
時日の夢を見るたび
Every time I dream of days gone by

916
01:03:30,629 --> 01:03:35,429
生まれた意味を考えてしまうのさ
I wonder why I came to be

917
01:03:35,429 --> 01:03:39,896
嗚呼、美しき蒼い日々だな
Ah, such beautiful, youthful days

918
01:03:39,896 --> 01:03:44,229
この目に焼き付けておこうかな
I should burn their images into my mind

919
01:03:44,229 --> 01:03:48,396
もう少し強くならないとな
But I'd have to be a little stronger first

920
01:03:57,196 --> 01:03:59,596
皆さん、聴いてくれてありがとうございました。
Everyone, thank you for listening!

921
01:03:59,596 --> 01:04:00,696
よいしょ。
All right.

922
01:04:00,696 --> 01:04:01,896
またね。
See you later!

923
01:04:13,196 --> 01:04:15,096
Catch you on the flip side!

924
01:04:15,096 --> 01:04:16,596
Peace!

925
01:04:21,096 --> 01:04:30,096
