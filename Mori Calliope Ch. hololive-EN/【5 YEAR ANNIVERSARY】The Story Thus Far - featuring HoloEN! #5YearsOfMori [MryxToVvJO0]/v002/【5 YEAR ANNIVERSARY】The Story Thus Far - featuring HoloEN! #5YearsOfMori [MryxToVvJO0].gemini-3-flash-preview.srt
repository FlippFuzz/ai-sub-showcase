00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:35,300
Ugh...

3
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,500
Oh, 皆さん...
Oh, everyone...

4
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,500
Oh, I don't feel so good.

5
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,400
Ugh...

6
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,400
Look, I'm gonna collapse from thickness.

7
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,300
Like I just went through a freaking portal or something crazy just happened.

8
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,000
At least I can see chat. Howdy.

9
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,700
No, no, I'm okay. Don't you worry about me.

10
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
I'm fine.

11
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,000
There's a... there's a lot of Dead Beats here today.

12
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,800
Maybe Dead Beats, KFP members, Takodachis...

13
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,500
...that's a lot of... ugh... people.

14
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:09,124
Let me catch my breath for a minute here.

15
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:11,108
Hold on.

16
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:14,824
That was some crazy traveling that I just did.

17
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:18,508
I think I went through like a wormhole or something.

18
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,541
It's not my fault that my eyes are done...

19
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,808
...No, hey, wait a minute!

20
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:24,441
Hey,

21
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:25,441
don't you start saying sh-

22
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:30,174
You start saying stuff like that, I swear to God I'll beat you within an inch of your life.

23
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:32,508
It's fine.

24
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:36,008
We're supposed to celebrate my fifth anniversary.

25
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:37,008
I'm five!

26
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:39,408
Can you guys believe I'm five?

27
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:43,341
Hold on, I probably should adjust the camera a little bit.

28
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:45,341
You can't see me, hang on.

29
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:49,008
Oh, you know what? I think I can take control of it if I click...

30
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:50,208
...there we go!

31
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:52,008
Oh.

32
00:05:55,141 --> 00:05:56,508
Hey there!

33
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:58,508
What's up?

34
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:05,508
Ah... what do you... what do you think?

35
00:06:05,808 --> 00:06:08,008
Do you like it?

36
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:11,408
Do you like this new outfit I found myself in?

37
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:13,808
Oh, "You look cute" Thank you!

38
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:16,508
Um, a lot of the girls told me I look like a robber...

39
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:19,808
...which, now that I've said it, you guys, you know, might be able to see it.

40
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:24,508
But, you know, there are various things that I can do and change with this...

41
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:25,508
...so...

42
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:27,008
So, "Beautiful" Oh, thank you!

43
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:29,508
"You look amazing" Thank you very much.

44
00:06:29,508 --> 00:06:31,341
"Nice outfit" they say. I'm glad that you like it.

45
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:33,808
There's... there's many things that I can do...

46
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:36,341
...um, but I feel like I should...

47
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:41,341
You know, a good magician never shows all of their tricks like right away.

48
00:06:41,341 --> 00:06:42,508
You know?

49
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:46,008
So, I figure, we have lots of time to celebrate...

50
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:50,341
...what is essentially five years of all of us being together, right?

51
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:54,341
So, I feel like I should be a little happier about that, right?

52
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:56,341
Thankfully, I can do something about that.

53
00:06:57,141 --> 00:07:00,508
Yay! Five years, five years!

54
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:05,008
But you know, as you guys know, your Mori has like...

55
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:08,508
...little bit of a resting B-word face.

56
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:11,674
So I kind of... kind of have to force myself to smile a little bit.

57
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:13,341
That's okay, I can do that.

58
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:15,174
I can totally do that.

59
00:07:15,174 --> 00:07:17,008
Hee!

60
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:20,341
Oh, wait, ah, sorry, I grabbed you.

61
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:22,174
I didn't mean to grab you.

62
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,008
What if I...

63
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,008
Peace.

64
00:07:28,174 --> 00:07:29,508
Bero.

65
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:32,341
Tehe-pero-pero.

66
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:36,008
Hold on, I can do more than that though.

67
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:37,841
That's not... I'm not a one-trick pony or anything.

68
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:39,508
Aargh!

69
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:41,174
This is my favorite face...

70
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:42,174
...ever!

71
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:46,508
Is this... this is how I look all the time off-stream when you don't see me.

72
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:50,508
It's like I... I click "Stream Owari" and then my eyes just immediately shrink...

73
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:53,008
...to look like this. Just so you know.

74
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:56,008
This is... this is my usual, this is my normal, my nature.

75
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:01,808
So shocked.

76
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:04,341
Uh, "Shock" is one word for it. Uh, deadbeats and ghostcats see this...

77
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:06,841
...every day. You're right.

78
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:10,341
You're right, Deadbeat, this is... this is the Mommy that they're used to.

79
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:14,008
And then this is just my current... my constant state of being.

80
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:17,341
You guys don't mind, right?

81
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:19,341
Resting B-word face.

82
00:08:20,508 --> 00:08:22,508
No problem, no problem.

83
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:24,508
Hi.

84
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:28,008
No, you guys are... you guys are... I'm just tired, but I'm happy.

85
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,008
I'm happy but I'm tired. This is normal, this is usual.

86
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:35,008
Nope, it's all good.

87
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:38,841
But but some day, um, we have plans to get like some really good...

88
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:42,508
...very decent face tracking. So look forward to that.

89
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:48,841
Um, oh by the way, just really quick before... before we get too in-deep into this...

90
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:53,508
Um, I have an announcement. There's a special goodie available to you guys.

91
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:56,508
You guys like goodies? I like goodies. You guys like goodies?

92
00:08:57,674 --> 00:08:59,841
Um, we have...

93
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:03,674
We have a very special item for those of you that use VRChat.

94
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:09,508
It is a penlight for this specific event that you'll be able to claim.

95
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:13,841
There's going to be a link in the description, they're updating it as we speak.

96
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:18,508
Um, and also there will be a link on Twitter... X... Twitter for you guys to grab it.

97
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:23,508
It's very special, it's got the logo from this specific event.

98
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:27,341
And I... I wanted to put it out there, thankfully with the help... um, of the AEV...

99
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:31,341
...and... and VRChat... to do something really special for you guys.

100
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:35,008
This is a claimable item just to celebrate this... this big event...

101
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,508
...together with you guys.

102
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:40,841
I hope you guys will enjoy it and use it in VRChat...

103
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:45,008
...and have lots of fun with your friends if we ever do something like...

104
00:09:45,008 --> 00:09:48,341
...future concerts in VRChat. I'm always really open to like...

105
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:52,508
...figuring out new tech and stuff like that... together with, you know...

106
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:56,008
...the other members and all these really amazing, technically powerful folks...

107
00:09:56,008 --> 00:10:00,008
...and figure out like what more cool creative stuff we can do together...

108
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:03,008
...in terms of like lives and whatnot.

109
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:03,008
DUE TO A THANATOLOGICAL INCIDENT THE ELEVATOR IS OUT OF SERVICE

110
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:07,516
...for this amazing world that we're gonna go explore.

111
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:09,516
Oh man, it's nostalgic.

112
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:10,516
It's nostalgic.

113
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:13,016
Um, I want to do more fun stuff like this.

114
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:18,516
That's what I've realized after working so hard on this project for so long.

115
00:10:18,516 --> 00:10:20,516
So, um... so yeah!

116
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:23,516
Thanks for, for being a part of it though, you guys.

117
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:25,516
I feel like I can get even wackier. Hold on.

118
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:27,516
Expressions, face expressions. Hold on.

119
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:29,016
Delay!

120
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:32,516
Wow!

121
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:35,016
This isn't a me you get to see very often.

122
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:38,516
Hehe. Aaaaah!

123
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:42,016
Then there's also... constant sleepiness.

124
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:46,016
Is this... this too is Seyun's guy?

125
00:10:46,016 --> 00:10:47,516
My beloved.

126
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:51,016
Now I look like her. Um, we should move along.

127
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:54,016
I know that we should move along.

128
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:58,016
First I want to give a really huge thank you to...

129
00:10:58,016 --> 00:11:01,516
...two folks who made this outfit possible.

130
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:04,016
Thank you so much to...

131
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:08,016
the designer of this outfit, Nanoless.

132
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:10,016
You guys know Nanoless?

133
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:15,016
Nanoless is so amazing and just has the most beautiful designs ever, outfit designs...

134
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:18,516
...and I had wanted to work with Nano for the longest time.

135
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:23,016
So I'm so glad that I got this outfit fully designed by Nanoless.

136
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:27,016
Hopefully we might get, we might get like a reference image at some point.

137
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:31,516
But thank you so much to Nano for creating this outfit. I love it so dearly.

138
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:35,016
I want to use it in music videos.

139
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:39,016
Um, so please look forward to that in the future.

140
00:11:39,016 --> 00:11:43,016
And I also want to give a big ups to Yuly as well...

141
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:47,016
...who designed the model for this outfit, did all the 3D modeling for it.

142
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:51,516
So Nanoless did the design and Yuly did the actual 3D modeling.

143
00:11:51,516 --> 00:11:55,016
And neither of those are easy tasks at all.

144
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:59,016
So thank you for going out of your way to make time for...

145
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:02,516
...just a little five-year-old Reaper like me.

146
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:06,016
I say five, I'm actually NO years old, but you get the point.

147
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,516
It's been five years together, right?

148
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:12,516
But yay! Yuly's so, so GOATed. Nano's so GOATed.

149
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:15,516
Thank you so much! And of course, this world...

150
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:20,516
...we're gonna get a little bit more into the creation of this world as well, I think.

151
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:24,016
But before we do that, we gotta kind of...

152
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:27,016
I want to kind of explore a little bit.

153
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:30,516
You know, there's stuff to look at around here, you guys. Hold on.

154
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:34,016
Did you guys see... hey, hang on a second.

155
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:37,016
There are a bunch of signs around here.

156
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:40,016
My Reaper looking extra cute. Thank you!

157
00:12:40,016 --> 00:12:44,016
Your Reaper is trying to figure out where the heck we are...

158
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:48,016
...but there are some clues here and there that we can look at, right?

159
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,516
DUE TO A THANATOLOGICAL INCIDENT THE ELEVATOR IS OUT OF SERVICE

160
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:50,016
So let's take a look at this.

161
00:12:49,516 --> 00:12:51,516
WHETHER YOU ARE ALIVE OR DEAD, PLEASE SEEK OUT YOUR LOCAL PSYCHOPOMP

162
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:53,016
Oh... I can read!

163
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:57,516
Due to a thanatological incident, the elevator is out of service.

164
00:12:57,516 --> 00:13:02,516
Whether you are alive or dead, please seek out your local psychopomp.

165
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:06,516
I know a couple psychopomps. None of them are in Holo...

166
00:13:06,516 --> 00:13:11,016
...but maybe someday we'll get a psychopomp.

167
00:13:11,016 --> 00:13:15,016
I feel like we'd be really good friends and get along.

168
00:13:15,016 --> 00:13:20,516
I don't know, five years I've been here, we haven't had a psychopomp...

169
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:25,516
...but who knows, in the next five we could maybe welcome one.

170
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:28,016
That would be cool.

171
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,516
Ame's elevator. See, that's what I'm thinking.

172
00:13:31,516 --> 00:13:35,016
I remember this elevator even just from the shape of it, right?

173
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:36,016
DO NOT ANNOY THE ELEVATOR ATTENDANT, AME

174
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:39,516
Do not annoy the elevator attendant, Ame.

175
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:44,016
Yeah, no, this is, this is definitely, this is 100% Ame's elevator, I think.

176
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:46,516
What happened to it?

177
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:50,016
MAXIMUM CAPACITY 12 PEOPLE 50 IF SMOL

178
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:50,516
Do you guys know what the heck happened to this place?

179
00:13:50,516 --> 00:13:54,016
Maximum capacity: 12 people. 50 if smol.

180
00:13:54,016 --> 00:13:57,516
Do you guys remember when we had less than 12 people?

181
00:13:57,516 --> 00:14:01,516
Because I do. I remember when we had less than 12 people.

182
00:14:01,516 --> 00:14:05,016
Look at that. Then not everybody would have been able to fit into the elevator.

183
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:08,516
You know, what about...

184
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:12,016
...Advent and Justice, right? They wouldn't be able to fit.

185
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:16,016
Um, I mean if they could, if they were smol.

186
00:14:16,016 --> 00:14:21,516
But the elevator would need to be renovated so that we could all fit.

187
00:14:21,516 --> 00:14:26,016
Ame, Ame elevator... back then.

188
00:14:26,016 --> 00:14:30,016
Smol, long times. Yes, time has flown by so fast, says Chat.

189
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:32,516
DO NOT FALL INTO TIME VORTEX

190
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:33,516
Hmm... time flies when you're having fun, right guys?

191
00:14:32,516 --> 00:14:34,516
We don't know what will happen, but it doesn't look good

192
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:37,016
Let's see. Do not fall into the time vortex.

193
00:14:35,516 --> 00:14:38,516
STRONG QUANTUM FLUCTUATIONS

194
00:14:37,016 --> 00:14:42,016
We don't know what will happen, but it doesn't look good.

195
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:41,516
Keep yourself observed at all times to avoid disappearing

196
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:45,016
Okay, gonna heed those wise words.

197
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:48,016
Strong quantum fluctuations.

198
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:53,016
Keep yourself observed at all times to avoid disappearing.

199
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:55,016
Heh? What the heck?

200
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:58,016
I don't want to disappear, I have stuff to do.

201
00:14:58,016 --> 00:15:02,016
Speaking of stuff to do, maybe we should move right along...

202
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:05,016
...because there are some really cool spots around here and I think I see...

203
00:15:06,024 --> 00:15:07,024
DO NOT FALL INTO TIME VORTEX

204
00:15:06,074 --> 00:15:07,324
Get this, Dead Beats.

205
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:08,424
A resort.

206
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,124
Will Mori Calliope be going there?

207
00:15:11,174 --> 00:15:13,774
Probably, probably... yes!

208
00:15:13,824 --> 00:15:16,524
I will for the sake of...

209
00:15:16,574 --> 00:15:18,774
for the sake of this journey.

210
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:20,674
I'll go to the resort.

211
00:15:20,724 --> 00:15:22,874
You guys want to come with?

212
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:25,474
Oh, I don't want to go alone.

213
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,674
So, my Dead Beats got to come with me, okay?

214
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:30,424
You guys got to come with me.

215
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:31,524
Is that all right?

216
00:15:31,574 --> 00:15:32,724
You guys cool with that?

217
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:35,624
I could kind of use a rest.

218
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:36,824
It would be nice.

219
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:39,474
We got some fun surprises today.

220
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:41,374
So please look forward to them.

221
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:44,824
But, I guess we'll try and make our way out of here then, shall we?

222
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:45,974
Hmm...

223
00:15:46,024 --> 00:15:47,374
Let's do it.

224
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:50,874
We need to observe you to prevent a disappearance.

225
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:52,474
You make a good point, skeletons.

226
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:54,124
You make a good point.

227
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:56,874
Well, let's go ahead and head on over then, shall we?

228
00:15:56,924 --> 00:15:58,424
What does this say?

229
00:15:58,474 --> 00:15:59,624
HUB...

230
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:01,324
Oh, I can't... Sorry, chat's kind of in my way.

231
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:02,574
That's all right.

232
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:04,224
I want you guys here.

233
00:16:04,274 --> 00:16:06,024
I want you guys here, so...

234
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:07,324
it's no problem.

235
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:09,224
HUB AREA, it says.

236
00:16:09,274 --> 00:16:10,274
Okay.

237
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:12,624
Observing, they're observing right now. Okay.

238
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:14,524
Mone-chans, do you hear that? They're observing.

239
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,224
Also, Mone-chans are here today working as hard as possible...

240
00:16:17,274 --> 00:16:19,274
with cameras and such.

241
00:16:19,324 --> 00:16:20,324
Thank you, Mone-chans.

242
00:16:20,374 --> 00:16:22,474
All right, well I guess off we go.

243
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,424
To the resort! Oh gosh.

244
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:27,074
I don't like going to resorts because, Dead Beats...

245
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:29,774
I feel like I'm going to give in to my base, you know, human instincts...

246
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:32,524
instead of my Reaper side, which says "work, work, work."

247
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,924
My human side says it's time for a vacation.

248
00:16:34,974 --> 00:16:36,324
So let's...

249
00:16:36,374 --> 00:16:37,474
Let's just go.

250
00:16:37,524 --> 00:16:39,874
Let's just go and see what happens, you know?

251
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,524
Making my way uptown.

252
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:44,274
Whoa!

253
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:48,524
I really need to fix my posture.

254
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:51,374
No, it's fine! Don't...

255
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:54,524
My posture's not the best.

256
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:58,524
I'm just... also, I can walk on water, by the way...

257
00:16:58,574 --> 00:17:00,624
in case... in case you didn't know.

258
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:02,524
You guys like my Naruto run?

259
00:17:02,574 --> 00:17:05,524
It's just my current state of being and movement.

260
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:06,624
You're back!

261
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:09,524
Oh wait, did you guys see the design on my back? The skull?

262
00:17:09,574 --> 00:17:11,174
That's my logo.

263
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:13,524
That's my logo. I really want to release this jacket someday.

264
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,874
Wouldn't that be cool?

265
00:17:14,924 --> 00:17:17,524
This would be a pretty cool jacket to release as merch.

266
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:20,674
I feel like I release too many clothing items, though.

267
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:22,874
We really don't need that many.

268
00:17:22,924 --> 00:17:25,474
Well, anyway, I guess we better...

269
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:27,074
better get out of here.

270
00:17:27,124 --> 00:17:28,474
Uh, what am I looking at?

271
00:17:28,524 --> 00:17:31,524
Oh gosh, I don't want to show you guys what the clothes can do yet.

272
00:17:31,574 --> 00:17:33,474
Uh, we'll get to that later, shall we?

273
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:35,024
Okay.

274
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:37,524
Let us be on our way, up the stairs.

275
00:17:37,574 --> 00:17:39,424
I'll try... my posture's great.

276
00:17:39,474 --> 00:17:42,524
I never would bend my back while I walk.

277
00:17:42,574 --> 00:17:44,274
That's not something that Mori Calliope would ever do.

278
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:45,774
Whoa!

279
00:17:48,524 --> 00:17:50,224
You guys see this?

280
00:17:50,274 --> 00:17:52,874
This is a full-on, this is a full-blown resort.

281
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:54,374
What's... oh.

282
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:55,774
Hold on a second.

283
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,474
Hey, what's this little switch here? It's got a camera.

284
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:00,374
Okay, can I activate it, I wonder?

285
00:18:00,424 --> 00:18:01,274
Oh.

286
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:02,824
Whoa! Check it!

287
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,774
You guys get a sweeping view.

288
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:06,374
Nice perspective.

289
00:18:06,424 --> 00:18:08,524
Anything wrong with your spine?

290
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:10,774
No, it needs relaxation, which is why we've come here...

291
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,374
to this resort.

292
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,274
It looks like I could run around it as like a Dark Souls map.

293
00:18:16,324 --> 00:18:18,674
Not everything is Dark Souls, I just... you know.

294
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:20,324
There's a bar!

295
00:18:20,374 --> 00:18:22,474
Wait, hold on, I just barely missed...

296
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:24,274
Hang on, I have to fix my knee.

297
00:18:24,324 --> 00:18:25,824
There's a bar!

298
00:18:25,874 --> 00:18:26,924
Dead Beats!

299
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:28,874
Hold on, we're in trouble now.

300
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:30,774
Hang on, let's get to the center here.

301
00:18:30,824 --> 00:18:32,524
Whoa!

302
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:36,474
I don't look very enthused, but I am excited.

303
00:18:36,524 --> 00:18:39,374
Booze? No, wait a minute, Dead Beats.

304
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:40,924
Wait, it's not time yet.

305
00:18:40,974 --> 00:18:43,474
It's not time, we have to... "Bar Mori"?

306
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:45,674
Do you guys remember Bar Mori?

307
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,474
Because I remember Bar Mori.

308
00:18:47,524 --> 00:18:49,674
Oh, that was so fun.

309
00:18:49,724 --> 00:18:51,674
I loved Bar Mori.

310
00:18:51,724 --> 00:18:54,374
We should... we should have had more adventures there...

311
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,774
but that's on me.

312
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:58,674
That's on me, I got too busy with other stuff.

313
00:18:58,724 --> 00:19:01,374
My knee's been feeling tired these days.

314
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:02,524
All about my knee.

315
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,674
There we go.

316
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:04,874
Anyway.

317
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:06,674
Fancy, classic.

318
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:09,574
This is not VR Chat, this is a vlog on Cali's vacation.

319
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:12,174
Wait, no, you've got it all wrong!

320
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:14,574
I'm working hard, I promise.

321
00:19:14,624 --> 00:19:18,374
Look at the way that the water reflects off of me, though.

322
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,824
Isn't it pretty neat?

323
00:19:19,874 --> 00:19:21,574
Hold on, can I do peace?

324
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:23,474
Peace!

325
00:19:24,174 --> 00:19:25,874
Peace!

326
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:28,524
I'm doing a pose, I'm doing a pose...

327
00:19:28,574 --> 00:19:29,774
Peace!

328
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:32,524
Hope you guys get lots of screenshots.

329
00:19:32,574 --> 00:19:36,174
And remember to use #5YearsOfMori...

330
00:19:36,224 --> 00:19:38,474
to share your favorite screenshots.

331
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:40,524
Okay? #5YearsOfMori.

332
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:43,474
You can also share your favorite memories...

333
00:19:43,524 --> 00:19:45,424
um, or, you know, fan art too if you want.

334
00:19:45,474 --> 00:19:47,374
Like whatever... whatever you want to use.

335
00:19:47,424 --> 00:19:50,274
#5YearsOfMori to celebrate five years...

336
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:53,374
of the Grim Reaper invading your personal space.

337
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:55,874
And by personal, I mean like your home.

338
00:19:55,924 --> 00:19:58,474
You know, because when you watch me, I'm there...

339
00:19:58,524 --> 00:19:59,624
in your home.

340
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:02,574
Well, I guess we should look around maybe a little bit more.

341
00:20:02,624 --> 00:20:03,724
Hmm...

342
00:20:03,774 --> 00:20:05,024
Cool, whoa, what's this?

343
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:04,532
I dare not.

344
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:06,312
I dare not lay down.

345
00:20:06,312 --> 00:20:08,152
We don't have time for that.

346
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:10,132
We don't have time.

347
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:13,232
Let's let's get moving around a little bit
'cause we got stuff to do.

348
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:15,932
Hang on a sec. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

349
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:17,532
YAGOO?

350
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:19,932
Hey, there's a bar over there, though.

351
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:22,132
There's a— there's a bar.

352
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:24,532
Before we get to YAGOO...

353
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:27,232
...can we just— can we hit the bar really quick?

354
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:28,532
Hang on.

355
00:20:28,832 --> 00:20:30,432
No, this is— this is big.

356
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:32,032
This is big, big news.

357
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,532
All right. Dead Beats.

358
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,832
Welcome to Bar Mori.

359
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:37,832
Welcome to Bar Mori.

360
00:20:38,032 --> 00:20:39,432
Oh, you guys are back here.

361
00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:42,832
I wonder if I can move— Let me get a martini.
Wait.

362
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:46,832
Hang on, I'm pulling you over here. I'm pulling my
chat in front of my face so that I can I can see them.

363
00:20:47,032 --> 00:20:49,132
Okay. Pop, float, and we're—
Okay. There we go.

364
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,732
Now I can see you perfectly!

365
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:55,332
Now I can— I can take your order.
What would you guys like?

366
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,532
Can I get some whiskey?

367
00:20:59,032 --> 00:21:02,232
Yes! I actually— I saved some just
for this special occasion, so...

368
00:21:02,532 --> 00:21:04,332
...let me go grab it. Right here.

369
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:07,532
Yes. Welcome to Bar Mori. Here it is.

370
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:10,832
Hold— hold to gra— oh, this one. Hold to grab.

371
00:21:11,132 --> 00:21:13,432
Oh, this! Okay, I got it.

372
00:21:13,532 --> 00:21:15,532
No, I— AAAHHH! Wait, I dropped it.

373
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:18,232
Okay. Hold on, hold on, hold on. No, okay.

374
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:20,532
I'm not very good at this.

375
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:23,532
I— maybe I really do need a vacation.
Wait, no. Okay. Hang on.

376
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:26,432
The melon soda! See, that's a— that's a good choice.

377
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:29,432
All right. Here's— Got any glasses here?

378
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:31,532
We don't... um...

379
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:35,832
Well, all right, all right, chat. This is for you.

380
00:21:36,532 --> 00:21:38,032
Fetch!

381
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,832
It landed perfectly upright!

382
00:21:43,332 --> 00:21:47,032
It landed perfectly. You know what? This reminds
me I used to tell you guys about my— my old job.

383
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:51,032
I used to have a tough old job
that I did back in the day...

384
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:55,032
...and I served somebody like a drink that
didn't have enough like vodka or tequila in it...

385
00:21:55,332 --> 00:21:59,832
...and they threw it in my face.
I remember telling you guys about that.

386
00:22:02,632 --> 00:22:05,232
Well, I've been through a lot,
and I'm ready to unleash my rage!

387
00:22:05,432 --> 00:22:08,532
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Something happened.

388
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:13,832
Okay. Sorry, I had a blackout right there for
a second. All right, is this Amaretto?

389
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:16,532
Can I juggle it?

390
00:22:17,532 --> 00:22:19,332
Yeah, I can!

391
00:22:20,532 --> 00:22:24,032
Oh man, she's too good. Oh, she's too skilled.

392
00:22:24,332 --> 00:22:27,032
Oh god, I dropped it. Okay, it's 'cause I got cocky.

393
00:22:27,132 --> 00:22:29,532
It happens all the time for me. Uh, hang on, I got it.

394
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:31,232
No problem.

395
00:22:31,832 --> 00:22:34,432
"So talented," they say. Big ups!

396
00:22:35,232 --> 00:22:38,032
What do you mean? No, no E— There's no E-sports.

397
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:41,532
Stop! 違うよ！
Stop! No way!

398
00:22:42,532 --> 00:22:44,532
It's coming out of your paycheck.

399
00:22:44,832 --> 00:22:47,332
You know what I think about that?

400
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:51,032
I may have thrown it too far. Oh, there it goes!

401
00:22:51,532 --> 00:22:54,532
Hey, this is way— this is better than I thought.

402
00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:59,232
Whoa, this is— this is actually very
stress-relieving, believe it or not.

403
00:23:00,332 --> 00:23:02,832
Bleh! Yeah, sometimes you just feel like you gotta...

404
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:06,532
I was supposed to be serving the Dead Beats.
Is this the thanks that they get...

405
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:11,032
...after five years of being loyal support—
supporters of the Grimm Reaper?

406
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,832
You know what? Yeah, it is!

407
00:23:15,432 --> 00:23:19,432
It's messed up. I have other goodies. I have other
I have other goodies for you guys, I promise.

408
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:23,832
Yes, yes it is. It's so worth it. That—
you guys are too kind to me.

409
00:23:24,032 --> 00:23:26,432
The Dead Beats are the kindest, what the heck.

410
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:30,032
Waffle house, watch out, watch out, watch out!
There's no...

411
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:33,532
...forget your street fights. This a trench war.

412
00:23:34,432 --> 00:23:36,032
Hang on, can I pick up the— WHOA!

413
00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:39,632
Oh my— I can pick up everything!
They freaking killed it with this.

414
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,832
Who is they? I will tell you shortly.

415
00:23:42,032 --> 00:23:46,232
But anyway, we— we could play with—
I could throw bottles at you guys all day...

416
00:23:46,532 --> 00:23:49,332
...but we do have to move right along
'cause we got a schedule to keep.

417
00:23:49,332 --> 00:23:50,532
Schedule to keep!

418
00:23:51,032 --> 00:23:54,532
All right. Let's go check out what
the heck happened over here.

419
00:23:59,632 --> 00:24:01,832
Um... what am I looking at?

420
00:24:02,632 --> 00:24:05,532
That's a... that's real special
right over there. The YAGOO.

421
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:11,532
Let me see if I can pull you guys up before me
again. Get in front of my face.

422
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:17,032
But yeah, so you can see... hang on. I gotcha.

423
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:20,532
Now don't be afraid. Don't be afraid, my small lambs.

424
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:24,432
This man will not hurt you. He's just...
he just has really expensive shorts.

425
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:26,032
#5YearsOfMori

426
00:24:28,332 --> 00:24:31,532
That's a— that's my boss, by the way.
This is Michelangelo's YAGOO.

427
00:24:32,032 --> 00:24:35,832
Golden swim trunks. Actually, uh 24-karat gold
swim trunks on my boss.

428
00:24:36,032 --> 00:24:39,232
Good for him, good for him. Thank you for
thank you for the the resort resources.

429
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:45,032
Hey, is that Justice?

430
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:46,232
JUSTICE

431
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:49,432
Cool! We also have paintings of my
cute kohai as well here. Very nice.

432
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:54,532
And then the architecture—
WHOA! Okay. We're not that ancient.

433
00:24:54,232 --> 00:24:55,632
MYTH

434
00:24:56,432 --> 00:24:58,232
Yo, who made this?

435
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:01,232
Who made this Myth?

436
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,460
I don't know, what do you guys think?

437
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,060
Ancient myth?

438
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,140
Oh man, this is where my membership money goes.

439
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,840
That Dead Beats right, it sure is. Right right here.

440
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,440
to a grand carving such as this.

441
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:18,940
Myth.

442
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,640
Yes, the oldest and most decrepit and most ancient.

443
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,840
After that we moved into the promise age.

444
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,140
I promise, cute!

445
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,440
I love that this one is different in that it looks
like it could be a kindergarten's drawing,

446
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,840
but it's clearly not, like they made it with intent.

447
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,940
So it's not really what it is but...

448
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,040
Anyway.

449
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,540
Let's go Promise!

450
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,440
And then we also have, oh we can't forget them,

451
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,340
Advent right here.

452
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,440
There's Advent.

453
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,940
Look at all my cute kohai.

454
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,940
Solidified in history.

455
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,040
What a place of beautiful art.

456
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,940
There's a lot of artisticness that went into this,
a lot of artistry.

457
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,840
Oh man, we gotta give thanks though to whoever
put all of this together, right?

458
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,740
Shall we go take a quick look?

459
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,040
Here we go.

460
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,140
This map was created by SeafoamBoy,

461
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,340
map design and concept, art and modelling.

462
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,840
And then, Mmaellon,

463
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,640
programming and camera systems.

464
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,340
Wow, why are we looking at this plaque like
they're dead or something? Did they die?

465
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,940
I don't think that they died or anything
like that.

466
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,340
They did so well though.

467
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,540
I mean, Seafoam's vision here is just so amazing.

468
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,040
I can see there's so much nostalgia and love
for the five years that

469
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,140
HoloEN has been together like this.

470
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,940
I just think it's such a cool concept and I'm so
excited to share all of this with you guys.

471
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,540
It's so so cool.

472
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Probably one of the coolest things I've ever done
in those five years is get a place like this.

473
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,440
Get to visit a place like this, right?

474
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,240
And then of course we can't forget Mmaellon who has
helped so much with the programming

475
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,840
and the camera systems.

476
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,040
I mean the camera systems is my favorite part
of this whole thing.

477
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,740
Like normally you can't do all this crazy stuff
with cameras.

478
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,440
But I'm so, so, so grateful.

479
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,640
Ah, thank you so much to you guys for the help
and all the programming too.

480
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,940
Man, my brain is... you guys know how my brain is.

481
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,140
It's not capable of handling things that programmer
brain can handle.

482
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,140
So I really, I really appreciate it.

483
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,040
And I'm so excited!

484
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,640
I don't look like I'm excited, but I'm excited

485
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,540
to get to the rest of it.

486
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,640
So yay!

487
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,540
We know. Hey, hold on a second.

488
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,340
Well, that's okay, I invited that conversation.

489
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,440
But there's something I want to... there's
something that's been bugging me.

490
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,440
Dead Beats, while we've been here...

491
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,940
It's that I feel like I did something here already.

492
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,040
I feel like I have a memory of being here at
a different time.

493
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,240
And I'm not just talking about the fact that it
reminds me of the original Myth lobby in many ways.

494
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,540
But oh wow, I really did just drop drinks
everywhere, huh? Okay.

495
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,140
That's kind of messed up. I really shouldn't
have done that, that was very rude of me.

496
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,940
I feel as though I've sung a song here
before with friends.

497
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,440
And I want... I'm thinking I might end up
remembering that.

498
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,440
I think I've sung a couple of songs here.

499
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,640
And so I think I want to flash back to those
if I can.

500
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,040
I feel like if I channel like my innermost
mind, my inner brain,

501
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,040
then I can have like a That's So Raven moment
where like you gaze into the future,

502
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
but instead it's the past.

503
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,940
The end will be a breeze... sorry sorry.

504
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,340
Anyway, so let's...

505
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,640
let's do that everybody, let's...

506
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,440
Let's go!

507
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,240
Flashback!

508
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,640
FLASH BANG

509
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Check us.

510
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,940
On and on it goes on and on you gotta let me go
but I'm already gone.

511
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,740
On and on it goes on and on you gotta let me go.

512
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,090
でしょ？
Right?

513
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,360
くらえ、慣れろこれが始まり
Take it, get used to it, this is the start

514
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,740
パーティーや集まれ人生は早々
Party time, gather 'round, life is fleeting

515
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,940
明日、名残に俺だ
Tomorrow, I'm the remnant

516
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,440
クソ遊びだ 醒ますデザインさ 早々
It's a shitty game, a design that awakens, quickly

517
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,940
死期、危機、欲し
Time of death, crisis, desire

518
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,340
命の、管理
Management of life

519
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,640
迷える私と、養子
Lost me and the child

520
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,040
あら あら あら あら
Oh my, oh my

521
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,840
本当は ずっともう oh oh
The truth is, for a long time now

522
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,440
楽しいフリして eh eh
Pretending to have fun

523
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,140
消えた私を oh oh
The me that vanished

524
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:49,440
君が見つけて
You found me

525
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,840
ね、ほら
Look, see?

526
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,140
ふらふらするでしょ
You're feeling dizzy, right?

527
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,640
くらくらするでしょ
Your head is spinning, right?

528
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,140
ほろほろ溶けそう
Feeling like I'm melting away

529
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,240
そうでしょ
Right?

530
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,473
FLASH BANG

531
00:30:02,128 --> 00:30:04,628
くら、くら、狂いそう
Dizzy, dizzy, like I'm going crazy

532
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:07,628
そろ、そろ、壊れそう　So the show
Slowly, slowly, like I'm breaking. So the show.

533
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:09,628
Flashback

534
00:30:12,128 --> 00:30:13,928
Hey! Hey!

535
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:15,328
Come on!

536
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:17,628
Break it down!

537
00:30:17,628 --> 00:30:19,128
Flashback

538
00:30:19,128 --> 00:30:22,628
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

539
00:30:22,628 --> 00:30:25,128
Come on everybody! Woo!

540
00:30:26,328 --> 00:30:27,928
Flashback

541
00:30:27,928 --> 00:30:29,628
Yeah yeah, Verse 2.

542
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:32,428
まどろむ Underground
Slumbering Underground

543
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:34,528
弾みついた開放感
A bouncy sense of liberation

544
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:36,628
剥がれたペルソナ
A peeled-off persona

545
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,528
Holly night, break it down
Holy night, break it down

546
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:40,928
だんだん　崩れてく感覚
Gradually, my senses crumble

547
00:30:40,928 --> 00:30:43,128
詰まるのは息をするように簡単
Getting stuck is as easy as breathing

548
00:30:43,128 --> 00:30:45,628
狂っていく　私　時は待ってなし
Going crazy, me, time doesn't wait

549
00:30:45,628 --> 00:30:47,928
涙は枯らし　あらあら
Tears are dried up, oh my

550
00:30:47,928 --> 00:30:50,428
山なんか転生した
Like I've been reincarnated into the afterlife

551
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:52,928
みたいな異世界感　まとって違う人みたいだ
Clad in an other-worldly feel, like I'm a different person

552
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:55,428
そりゃ今日もお美しであっともっとアンダ
Well, today you're beautiful too, and more...

553
00:30:55,428 --> 00:30:56,728
You choose me

554
00:30:58,628 --> 00:31:02,128
あの頃の君はもう幻のように吸い込まれそう
The you of those days is like a phantom now, about to be sucked away

555
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:06,128
それが Flashback　滑り出すんだ目が回るんだ
That is the flashback. It starts sliding, my head is spinning.

556
00:31:06,128 --> 00:31:08,628
ぐるぐるぐるぐる
Round and round and round and round

557
00:31:09,628 --> 00:31:12,628
本当はきっともう
The truth is, surely already

558
00:31:13,628 --> 00:31:17,628
戻れないよね
We can't go back, can we?

559
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:21,928
ちらつく心
A flickering heart

560
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:27,628
君を探して
Searching for you

561
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:31,328
よ、ほら　ふらふらするでしょ
Yo, look, you're getting dizzy, aren't you?

562
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,928
くらくらするでしょ
Dizzy, dizzy, aren't you?

563
00:31:33,928 --> 00:31:36,928
ほらほら、解きそう　そうでしょ
Look, look, it's about to come undone, isn't it?

564
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,628
Flashback

565
00:31:38,628 --> 00:31:40,928
ギラギラ酔いましょう
Let's get dazzled and drunk

566
00:31:40,928 --> 00:31:42,928
さあさあ踊りましょう
Come on, come on, let's dance

567
00:31:42,928 --> 00:31:47,128
真っ白に目眩むほどほら焼き付けてよ
Look, sear it in until it's dazzlingly white

568
00:31:47,128 --> 00:31:48,628
Flashback

569
00:31:55,128 --> 00:31:57,128
Flashback

570
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:05,628
Flashback

571
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:13,128
Woo-hoo! Nice job, CHAD-KAS!

572
00:32:13,128 --> 00:32:14,628
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

573
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:19,628
Well done. You guys got some moves.

574
00:32:20,128 --> 00:32:21,128
Oh my god.

575
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:22,628
What's she doing?

576
00:32:22,628 --> 00:32:23,928
What's she doing?

577
00:32:24,128 --> 00:32:25,128
Are you good?

578
00:32:25,128 --> 00:32:27,628
I was thinking you could use a little rest.

579
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:29,628
I think you could... What is she doing?

580
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:31,128
Hey, hey. It's okay.

581
00:32:31,128 --> 00:32:32,128
IRyS, I think...

582
00:32:32,128 --> 00:32:34,128
I think you guys need to go relax.

583
00:32:34,128 --> 00:32:36,128
You guys need to go... All right, great.

584
00:32:36,628 --> 00:32:39,128
Have some fun at the resort, you know there's a cool bar.

585
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:40,328
Resort time!

586
00:32:40,328 --> 00:32:42,628
I'll see ya!

587
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,128
Bye, you two!

588
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:48,628
Oh god, I have a feeling it's about to get real wild back there.

589
00:32:48,628 --> 00:32:52,128
Maybe we should do another song though, in the meantime, huh?

590
00:32:52,628 --> 00:32:54,628
Bye, guys! They're gone.

591
00:32:55,128 --> 00:32:57,128
They'll have fun. Don't worry about them.

592
00:32:57,628 --> 00:33:00,328
Let's... let's do another song, shall we?

593
00:33:00,628 --> 00:33:02,128
Let's go!

594
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:15,628
Kamoflauge

595
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:15,928
My Kamoflauge

596
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,928
My Kamoflauge

597
00:33:18,928 --> 00:33:20,328
My Kamoflauge

598
00:33:20,328 --> 00:33:22,628
What you gonna do, shit, take a walk?

599
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:24,628
Like I had a choice

600
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,628
Like a see-saw, just say so

601
00:33:27,628 --> 00:33:29,628
Hush my boy

602
00:33:29,628 --> 00:33:31,628
Never pick a figure

603
00:33:31,628 --> 00:33:33,628
And disappearing, ice, na-na-na

604
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:35,628
Secret sinners, oh you rang

605
00:33:35,628 --> 00:33:37,628
Can't fool me like tick-tick-bang

606
00:33:37,628 --> 00:33:39,628
Come alive, there you go

607
00:33:40,128 --> 00:33:42,628
眩日な逃避行
A dazzling escape

608
00:33:43,128 --> 00:33:46,628
どこまでも匿名希望
Wishing for anonymity forever

609
00:33:48,628 --> 00:33:50,628
Excuse to see some proof it's me

610
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:53,128
Puh-puh-pa don't react, eyes right here

611
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:55,128
Whoa-oh-oh, so crazy what you want

612
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:57,628
Predicting all my flaws

613
00:33:57,628 --> 00:34:00,628
But all you see is my Kamoflauge

614
00:34:00,628 --> 00:34:02,928
Whoa-oh-oh, hey baby why so sharp

615
00:34:03,628 --> 00:34:06,128
Your Mona Lisa tough

616
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,128
Still nothing you search can show my heart

617
00:34:08,628 --> 00:34:10,628
My Kamoflauge

618
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:13,128

619
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:15,628

00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:18,628
My Kamoflauge

621
00:34:18,628 --> 00:34:21,128
My Kamoflauge

622
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:23,128
My Kamoflauge, what you gonna do shit, take a walk

623
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:25,128
Come alive, got to shift with the scene and the vibe

624
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:27,628
And I'm just shuffling with the moment

625
00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:30,128
Don't let it stop, no chance, this who you got to be

626
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:33,128
Come alive, where you go

627
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:35,628
鏡合わせの向こう
Beyond the mirror alignment

628
00:34:36,628 --> 00:34:40,128
すり抜ける　この包囲網
Slipping through this dragnet

629
00:34:41,628 --> 00:34:44,128
Excuse to see some proof it's me

630
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:46,328
Puh-puh-pa don't react, eyes right here

631
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:48,628
Whoa-oh-oh, so crazy what you want

But all you see is my Kamoflauge

Whoa-oh-oh, hey baby why so sharp

00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:59,128
Your Mona Lisa tough

636
00:34:59,128 --> 00:35:00,128
Still nothing you search can show my heart

637
00:35:02,865 --> 00:35:03,815
My camouflage

638
00:35:03,815 --> 00:35:04,999
My camouflage

What you gonna do, shit, take a walk

645
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,799
Hey, why so sharp?

646
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:21,099
Shit, take a walk

647
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:22,699
My camouflage

648
00:35:22,699 --> 00:35:25,599
Doing something new, shit, can't you knock?

649
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:30,115
Can't fight no more

650
00:35:30,115 --> 00:35:32,582
Hideaway, hideaway

651
00:35:32,582 --> 00:35:36,682
What is this dark side I'm heading for?

652
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:38,982
It is something

653
00:35:38,982 --> 00:35:40,765
It is something

654
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:43,032
So crazy what you want

655
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:45,565
Predicting all my font

656
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:48,049
But all you see is my camouflage

657
00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:50,532
What happen-ah? Hey deadbeat, why so sharp?

658
00:35:50,532 --> 00:35:53,982
Your Mona Lisa touch, doing something new, shit, can't you knock?

659
00:35:54,949 --> 00:35:56,565
So crazy what you want

660
00:35:56,565 --> 00:35:59,865
Predicting all my font, but all you see is my camouflage

661
00:36:02,315 --> 00:36:04,999
What happen-ah? Hey deadbeat, why so sharp?

662
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:09,099
Your Mona Lisa touch, doing something new, shit, can't you knock?

What you gonna do, shit, can't you knock?

669
00:36:25,732 --> 00:36:27,965
Guess I gotta use this camouflage.

670
00:36:34,132 --> 00:36:37,465
Bau bau bau bau bau bau bau!

671
00:36:37,665 --> 00:36:38,432
Hi!

672
00:36:38,432 --> 00:36:42,049
Oh geez! Thank you guys for dancing with me today!

673
00:36:42,049 --> 00:36:44,232
Wow, and you guys sound so good too!

674
00:36:46,565 --> 00:36:48,115
Oh! I'm being hugged!

675
00:36:48,115 --> 00:36:49,715
I'm being hugged! Oh my gosh!

676
00:36:52,782 --> 00:36:55,282
Wait, go enjoy the resort, you guys. Have fun!

677
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:58,199
Get some rest. Bye-bye!

678
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:00,382
There's doggy treats over there... maybe.

679
00:37:00,665 --> 00:37:02,299
Go find 'em. Go find 'em.

680
00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:03,999
They're gonna go look for the treats.

681
00:37:04,915 --> 00:37:08,315
(sigh) Maybe... maybe I should relax here for a little bit.

682
00:37:08,315 --> 00:37:10,765
No! We have more songs to do, Dead Beats.

683
00:37:10,765 --> 00:37:13,015
No rest for the wicked.

684
00:37:13,015 --> 00:37:15,965
So, while my friends are enjoying the resort,

685
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:18,282
I'm gonna go do some more work.

686
00:37:18,282 --> 00:37:20,615
Just for a little bit, though. We can go back later, right?

687
00:37:21,132 --> 00:37:22,715
Yeah. That's what I'm gonna go do.

688
00:37:23,215 --> 00:37:24,765
Well, let's get out of here.

689
00:37:28,215 --> 00:37:29,815
No, no, we can come back later.

690
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:31,982
We can come back later. I'm out.

691
00:37:31,982 --> 00:37:33,615
I'm outskies. I'm out.

692
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:40,582
Yeah, don't... don't worry about... about those guys.

693
00:37:40,582 --> 00:37:44,182
Hey, listen, in fairness, don't worry about the Xbox mic either.

694
00:37:44,182 --> 00:37:46,399
I did that to them on purpose.

695
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:49,432
It was not them, it was me.

696
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:52,499
I cursed their mics with Xbox mic syndrome because...

697
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:54,765
(chokes) Choking on my own spit.

698
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,865
Because... because... their voices are too cute and they needed to be nerfed.

699
00:37:59,865 --> 00:38:01,765
That's all that it was.

700
00:38:01,765 --> 00:38:05,232
But no, it's not... it's not their fault. I assure you it was all me.

701
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:10,499
How dare you! That's fine. I will take... I will take your insults.

702
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:12,515
I will take all of them.

703
00:38:12,515 --> 00:38:15,932
Also, if my friends, if my friends ever need me to come in for a song

704
00:38:15,932 --> 00:38:19,715
and like, tank all the bad words, let me know. I'll do it.

705
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:23,665
I went through... I went through a period in the past five years

706
00:38:23,665 --> 00:38:26,115
where I was like... Here, we can walk and talk.

707
00:38:26,115 --> 00:38:29,115
We can walk and talk. I went through a period of time

708
00:38:29,115 --> 00:38:32,632
within the past five years being like, 'You know what?'

709
00:38:32,632 --> 00:38:34,915
'Maybe I should calm down with the curse words.'

710
00:38:34,915 --> 00:38:38,499
But... but it's just because, you know, I'm getting to be an old woman, right?

711
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:42,382
As you can see, I'm walking like a decrepit, crotchety old lady...

712
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:44,732
...with my shoulders all the way down.

713
00:38:44,732 --> 00:38:47,665
But honestly, if it's for a song, who cares, right?

714
00:38:47,665 --> 00:38:50,099
It's just... just for F-word.

715
00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:52,999
Yeah, speed walking. Good old curse words.

716
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:56,882
We stay family-friendly here, but to be honest... to be honest,

717
00:38:56,882 --> 00:39:00,932
I've... I've heard children use fouler language than I've ever used in my life.

718
00:39:00,932 --> 00:39:03,815
So, you know what? It is what it is.

719
00:39:03,815 --> 00:39:07,115
It is what it is. It looks like I'm rapidly roller skating.

720
00:39:07,115 --> 00:39:09,965
Maybe that's what I'm doing. Maybe there are skates

721
00:39:09,965 --> 00:39:12,165
on the bottom of these shoes and you guys don't even know.

722
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:16,049
Anyway, um, I look like less of a robber, don't you think?

723
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:17,799
Without the beanie?

724
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:21,115
I look a little bit less like I'm gonna break into your home...

725
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,599
...which is, I don't know, a plus or minus depending upon how you view it.

726
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,965
But I can take my headphones off too. See? There, they're gone.

727
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:31,982
They're gone. I don't really know. I mean, it kind of covers my jewelry

728
00:39:31,982 --> 00:39:34,899
so it's kind of nice that you can see the finer details, right?

729
00:39:34,899 --> 00:39:37,799
So I've got like a little skull lapel. Check it.

730
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:41,382
Lapel... lapel? It's maybe just a pin. I don't know.

731
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:45,415
But I'm really into chokers these days and spikes and stuff like that.

732
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:48,499
So, yeah. Law-abiding Reaper. Oh, but of course, but of course.

733
00:39:48,499 --> 00:39:51,499
Definitely. Looking respect-... oh, of course, yeah.

734
00:39:51,499 --> 00:39:54,499
Looking... checking respect... Yeah, only with respect.

735
00:39:54,982 --> 00:39:58,282
With respect. What do you guys think?

736
00:39:59,049 --> 00:40:01,832
Do you like the inside of my jacket too?

737
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,649
It's got kind of like a checker pattern. Anyway, we're supposed to be moving.

738
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:09,290
Wait along, but I'm kind of taking my time around here as well.

739
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:14,290
We do have many more memories to... re-familiarize ourselves with though.

740
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,590
Let me... let me grab you.

741
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,590
Oh, don't worry. You won't feel it and it won't hurt.

742
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,290
Okay, I've grabbed you successfully.

743
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:25,290
Let me... hold on. Swirl eyes? What do those look like?

744
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,790
Hang on. Oh, I'm still on desktop. Okay.

745
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,790
Swirl eyes...

746
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,790
She's a little quirky and crazy.

747
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:39,290
But it makes me like her more, I guess. I don't know.

748
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:42,790
You're still here after five years? You've certainly got some taste.

749
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,790
All right, let's go ahead and move.

750
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:48,290
I love the architecture in this place.

751
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,790
Lots of respect to the underworldian culture here.

752
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,790
With our... our underworldian maidens.

753
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:57,790
I don't know who this lady is. Could this be the real Calliope?

754
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,290
Could it be...

755
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,790
...the real Muse Calliope? It could be.

756
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:06,290
If it isn't, then that's now my headcanon, but...

757
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:10,290
...but I probably should change my... my eyes to not be so swirly. Sorry about that.

758
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,290
I'm just being extra quirky today.

759
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:16,790
Lore, hmmm? I'm telling you, I think that it's the original Calliope.

760
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:21,290
We're going to move with respect, right behind her.

761
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,290
And I wanted to say I saw this before, but I didn't want to get too ahead of myself.

762
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,790
Check this out guys. Where are we?

763
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:30,790
What is this place? You can see the sky and the fragments.

764
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:35,290
But then beyond, there's like a swirling deserted city.

765
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:39,790
And then I see that there's like... I'm really interested in the Hell Temple that's over here.

766
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:42,790
Do you guys see that Hell Temple? I think we should go there next.

767
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:46,290
It reminds me of something that I've seen before on multiple levels, right?

768
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:51,790
I think that you guys might be able to draw the links between the places that we're visiting today...

769
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:56,790
...and also some VR shenanigans that we've gotten down to in the past, right?

770
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:00,790
But... but for now, it looks cool. Yay!

771
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:05,290
Design is wild, right? Isn't it awesome?

772
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:09,790
And we're going home, onto the next stage indeed, AD-LIB indeed.

773
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:14,290
Like from AD-LIB and JIGOKU 6. AD-LIB and JIGOKU 6 was... was my concert, right?

774
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:18,790
But JIGOKU 6 is my EP. Maybe it's not the best idea to use the same...

775
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:23,290
...the same word in my concert/shows, because people might get confused.

776
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,290
Anyway, we're going over the bridge to check out what the heck this place is.

777
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:30,290
I love lanterns! The aesthetic is pretty much on point for what I enjoy, but...

778
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:35,290
...uh... Hold on. I'm getting that... weird feeling again, like I've been here before.

779
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:43,290
Uh... hang on a second. Hey, hey, hey, hold up. You see that? It's one of those... one of those camera signs.

780
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:49,790
What if we touch it? Hold on a sec. Let me see that camera. Camera right here.

781
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:59,790
Uh... this should give us a sweeping view. Okay, check it out. Oh, whoa!

782
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:17,290
Okay, now I'm feeling ultra nostalgic.

783
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:24,290
Heh? I feel like this isn't the first time that I entered this place though. Like I've seen it before.

784
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:32,290
Uh... I think I feel a memory coming on you guys. A memory singing a song with someone here.

785
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:39,290
Well, if that's the case, then let's... let's check it out!

786
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:46,790
Oh, this place is pretty cool too! Heh? Cool stuff everywhere.

787
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:52,290
Especially... well, this is awesome! It's got lanterns!

788
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:57,290
What the heck? Didn't I dance in front of that fire during JIGOKU 6?

789
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:01,290
Hey, is that the pirate from the Future Island stage that was in the JIGOKU 6 concert?

790
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:04,790
It has to be! This place is awesome! This is so cool! What the heck?

791
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:11,790
Heh? I wonder... are there any friends around here too? What friends are here, I wonder?

792
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:17,790
Oh... oh... oh... Are you okay?

793
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:21,790
Oh, she's climbing up those stairs.

794
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:25,290
I know there's a lot of stairs. Jimodori? Are you okay?

795
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:29,790
I know it was a lot of stairs. She's really wheezing.

796
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:33,790
Oh god. Are you okay, little one?

797
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,790
I'm alive...

798
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,790
This place is flames!

799
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:40,290
Hey there!

800
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:44,290
Hi! You might not know this, but I can see a lot of things from down here.

801
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:47,290
I... I know you can. I... I figured as much.

802
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:52,790
Whoa, hey. Don't look too long though. Don't look too... Whoa there, whoa. She's a little close.

803
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,790
You've got such a big head here. I didn't expect to see you like this.

804
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:59,790
Oh my lord. Uh... wait, you're not mad at me?

805
00:45:00,978 --> 00:45:02,978
No, no, no, I have no problem with it, it's just...

806
00:45:03,478 --> 00:45:06,978
That... really... what is it... the ahoge... it really sticks out.

807
00:45:07,278 --> 00:45:08,978
Oh my god! Ouch! Ouch!

808
00:45:09,278 --> 00:45:11,978
Why are you beating on me? Hey! Oi, oi, omae!
Why are you beating on me? Hey! Hey, hey, you!

809
00:45:12,978 --> 00:45:14,978
It's a show! Move over! Quick! Quick!

810
00:45:15,478 --> 00:45:17,978
Stop! Stop it! Why are you so crazy?

811
00:45:18,478 --> 00:45:21,978
I know the answer. I know the answer.

812
00:45:22,278 --> 00:45:23,278
What's the answer?

813
00:45:23,478 --> 00:45:24,978
I love you so much though.

814
00:45:25,278 --> 00:45:27,978
And I love you, Mori-chama. I can't wait to...

815
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:28,478
Oh god...

816
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:29,978
...do so many things with you.

817
00:45:30,278 --> 00:45:31,978
I want to do some things with you too,

818
00:45:31,978 --> 00:45:33,978
but one of those things is... thing.

819
00:45:34,278 --> 00:45:36,978
One... thing on this stage in front of this fire.

820
00:45:37,278 --> 00:45:38,278
Name two!

821
00:45:39,478 --> 00:45:41,978
Um... dance on this stage in front of this fire.

822
00:45:42,478 --> 00:45:44,478
Okay, what's the third one though?

823
00:45:44,978 --> 00:45:46,478
Um... be beside you.

824
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:48,478
Does it start with kissing me?

825
00:45:48,978 --> 00:45:51,978
Um, maybe later... we can... not in front of the people.

826
00:45:52,478 --> 00:45:55,478
It depends on where, too. You may kiss my hand if you want.

827
00:45:55,978 --> 00:45:56,978
(Mwah!)

828
00:45:57,478 --> 00:45:58,978
Okay, yeah, that's...

829
00:45:59,278 --> 00:46:01,478
Perfect, perfect. Alright, that's great.

830
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:03,978
Shall we sing a little... a little song?

831
00:46:03,978 --> 00:46:05,978
Oh god, I'm flustered now.

832
00:46:06,478 --> 00:46:08,978
Alright, let's sing a dang song together.

833
00:46:08,978 --> 00:46:09,978
How about it?

834
00:46:10,978 --> 00:46:13,478
Alright, play music!

841
00:46:32,478 --> 00:46:33,978
One, two, one by one to play the toy

842
00:46:33,978 --> 00:46:35,978

I can play the hero if it means I'll be the last clown

848
00:46:46,278 --> 00:46:48,478
Living in the twisted diorama that is industry

849
00:46:48,478 --> 00:46:50,478

859
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,478
Hate to be the one to break the fairy tale apart

860
00:47:30,478 --> 00:47:32,478
But the cash inside the mechanism's what they label smart

861
00:47:32,478 --> 00:47:34,978

00:47:39,978 --> 00:47:41,278
it's reading like a ransom letter

866
00:47:41,478 --> 00:47:43,478
Full of stains we'll never clean or wash away

867
00:47:43,478 --> 00:47:46,478

hope that you can take it with you

900
00:49:00,478 --> 00:49:02,478

The real...

920
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,959
I remember when Gigi was freaking it, do you guys?

921
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:20,359
She was freaking it.

922
00:50:21,759 --> 00:50:24,859
I think it's super cute that I feel...

923
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:28,559
...I get the feel that only she has chosen to be in that form.

924
00:50:30,459 --> 00:50:32,959
Only Gigi... only Gigi wanted to be so,

925
00:50:32,959 --> 00:50:36,859
...so small and rotund and cute.

926
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:40,959
Anyway, I guess we should look around a little bit. She does that all the time.

927
00:50:40,959 --> 00:50:44,159
I see some Grims in here know what's up, or any...

928
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:47,259
Gigi, Gigi's so special.

929
00:50:47,259 --> 00:50:50,159
Oh, I love her, I love her very much.

930
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:52,859
She's always so nice and fun to hang out with.

931
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:56,459
I was so glad that I could, I could sing on a stage like this with her.

932
00:50:56,459 --> 00:51:00,059
Speaking of this stage, should we look around a little bit? Here, follow me.

933
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:03,459
What's this? This seems like a really cool view over here.

934
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:07,459
I love that the lanterns have like this Myth... Myth logo on them. Check it.

935
00:51:09,259 --> 00:51:12,459
Do you guys see? Look, and they glow in like red and yellow.

936
00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:16,959
And you can see so many different areas just from here.

937
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:21,059
Heh, Myth forever, right guys?

938
00:51:22,859 --> 00:51:27,459
See that place over there, that... is that... is that Atlantis? I want to go to Atlantis.

939
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:31,959
Wait, we can't... we can't get ahead of ourselves though. There are a lot of different places to look at, but...

940
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:37,959
Oh man, I guess we can, we can look at a little bit more of this area.

941
00:51:39,859 --> 00:51:42,259
Uh, let's see.

942
00:51:42,659 --> 00:51:46,459
As I mentioned before in the memory, that, that pirate...

943
00:51:46,459 --> 00:51:49,459
...is that the pirate from the...

944
00:51:49,459 --> 00:51:53,759
...from the Future Island performance from Jigoku 6? The concert?

945
00:51:53,759 --> 00:51:55,459
I think it is. Look at that big guy.

946
00:51:55,959 --> 00:51:59,959
And it says... I think that's the kanji for "king" on his... Oh gosh, there's fire in my eyes.

947
00:52:00,959 --> 00:52:03,459
We don't want to fall down there,

948
00:52:03,459 --> 00:52:07,959
...but if we did fall down there, something cool might happen. Maybe there's a secret underneath that fire.

949
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:12,859
I want to discover the secrets. But there will be time to look at secrets later, I think.

950
00:52:14,959 --> 00:52:17,759
Uh, getting really... getting really hot, Dead Beats.

951
00:52:19,959 --> 00:52:21,959
Ugh, I don't feel so good.

952
00:52:21,959 --> 00:52:24,959
But the heat is reminding me of something.

953
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:28,959
The heat is reminding me that... I think that... this wasn't the only performance that I did here.

954
00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:33,959
I think there was another one, with two... with two other people.

955
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:40,459
If I stand here, I might be able to... remember.

956
00:52:45,959 --> 00:52:47,259
All right. I think I do.

957
00:52:48,959 --> 00:52:51,259
Okay. Check it out!

958
00:52:56,459 --> 00:52:59,759

959
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:03,559

清楚の depth, you’re just a shame
The depth of "Seiso", you’re just a shame

961
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,659

962
00:53:10,659 --> 00:53:11,959
Shit! I’m a walking disaster,

963
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:13,859
Then I’ve got the last girl.

964
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:14,959
You say stop, I go faster,

965
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:17,759

970
00:53:28,259 --> 00:53:31,959

973
00:53:38,759 --> 00:53:41,759
Say a prayer, now this is what I'm sayin'.

974
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,259
Forget sports, this is war, what you waiting for?

975
00:53:45,259 --> 00:53:48,959
Good Lord, Mori's bored, welcome to the killin’ floor.

976
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:50,659
Got no will to rot,

977
00:53:50,659 --> 00:53:52,359
Don't look at me like I'm dumb.

978
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:55,459
Do my swear, life ain't fair, I don't care, the end is nigh.

979
00:53:55,459 --> 00:53:58,959
The end is nigh.

980
00:53:58,959 --> 00:54:02,959
The end is nigh, uh, didn't get the memo yet, end is nigh.

981
00:54:02,959 --> 00:54:06,259
Boys line up single file, gonna end the world in style,

00:54:20,459 --> 00:54:23,759
She on a new world order's throne, does that make you see?

988
00:54:23,759 --> 00:54:26,959
Prepare for the apocalypse, they hit my guts a rhythm hits,

989
00:54:26,959 --> 00:54:30,759
Don't take the bait, stick to the script, then brim like a fool when the numbers dip.

990
00:54:30,759 --> 00:54:32,759
What now? Make 'em shut down,

991
00:54:32,759 --> 00:54:34,459
Yeah Shinigami gang in a rough town,

992
00:54:34,459 --> 00:54:36,459
Break new ground, black and blue sound,

993
00:54:36,459 --> 00:54:37,959
またまたブチかまし next round.
Giving it my all once again in the next round.

994
00:54:37,959 --> 00:54:41,259
悪知の my mind, don't want you to die, prices a little bit of ego.
With my cunning mind, I don't want you to die, prices a little bit of ego.

995
00:54:41,259 --> 00:54:44,659
The cynics want a seat in these rows, emperors got hella new clothes.

996
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:48,259
Forget sports, this is war, what you waiting for?

997
00:54:48,259 --> 00:54:51,759
Good Lord, Mori's bored, welcome to the killin’ floor.

998
00:54:51,759 --> 00:54:53,759
Love ain't fair, but hold up what's this?

999
00:54:53,759 --> 00:54:55,459
Naturally that means death is justice.

1000
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:58,959
Let me liberate you, step back I hate you, we gonna make it go bam bam bam bam bam!

1001
00:54:58,959 --> 00:55:01,959
The end is nigh.

1002
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:02,959
The end is nigh...

1003
00:55:03,014 --> 00:55:05,514
Single file, when having the worst of times

1004
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:07,214
Get onto my level and start the fight

1005
00:55:07,214 --> 00:55:09,514
Gotta come on, gotta end this night!

1006
00:55:23,014 --> 00:55:28,514
Rat-tat-tat-ta-da!

1007
00:55:28,514 --> 00:55:30,514
So end it all...

1008
00:55:30,514 --> 00:55:33,014
...end this night!

1009
00:55:35,014 --> 00:55:36,514
End this night!

1010
00:55:36,514 --> 00:55:38,514
Something's gotta give

1011
00:55:38,514 --> 00:55:40,214
Gonna burn that retching live

1012
00:55:40,214 --> 00:55:41,814
Get onto my level and step the light

1013
00:55:41,814 --> 00:55:44,014
Let it pass by, end this night!

1014
00:55:44,014 --> 00:55:48,014
Woo! Yeah, yeah!

1015
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:53,014
All right! Big up Raora and IRyS!

1016
00:55:54,514 --> 00:55:55,514
Come on!

1017
00:55:56,014 --> 00:55:58,014
Rat-tat-tat, end this night!

1018
00:56:11,014 --> 00:59:02,014
We Are Currently Experiencing Technical Difficulties. Please Hold!

1019
00:59:02,514 --> 00:59:05,214
Uh oh, where am I?

1020
00:59:05,514 --> 00:59:07,514
Hang on! Hang on guys!

1021
00:59:08,514 --> 00:59:11,014
Where are my Dead Beats? Where are...

1022
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,014
I think I found them. Hang on.

1023
00:59:13,514 --> 00:59:16,014
Uh... my Dead Beats! Oh gosh...

1024
00:59:16,514 --> 00:59:20,014
I feel like I have to go pick up my special camera.

1025
00:59:20,214 --> 00:59:23,014
My special camera, I left it...

1026
00:59:23,214 --> 00:59:25,514
I left it at the... the other... the other place.

1027
00:59:26,014 --> 00:59:29,214
Yeah, that performance was a little too hot, you guys.

1028
00:59:29,514 --> 00:59:32,014
Uh, I think it destroyed...

1029
00:59:32,214 --> 00:59:36,214
it destroyed the computer, it destroyed VRC, it destroyed everything.

1030
00:59:36,514 --> 00:59:38,514
That's how hot of a performance that was.

1031
00:59:38,814 --> 00:59:41,214
Hold on, let's... I bet we can cut through here

1032
00:59:41,214 --> 00:59:43,014
really quick to get my camera.

1033
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:46,514
(Grunts) Hang on.

1034
00:59:46,814 --> 00:59:49,814
Well, you guys know how it's been the past five years.

1035
00:59:50,014 --> 00:59:53,014
There's always a little surprise guest...

1036
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,514
...some scuff.

1037
00:59:54,814 --> 00:59:57,214
I... I like to believe that EN has moved on

1038
00:59:57,214 --> 01:00:00,014
from all of that, but occasionally it will creep back up on me.

1039
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,514
That's okay, no problem.

1040
01:00:03,795 --> 01:00:04,995
I'm gonna grab my camera.

1041
01:00:05,295 --> 01:00:06,595
Okay, here we go.

1042
01:00:08,095 --> 01:00:09,795
Oof! Quite the workout.

1043
01:00:09,995 --> 01:00:11,195
But I got it.

1044
01:00:11,395 --> 01:00:11,995
Hello!

1045
01:00:12,295 --> 01:00:14,895
As you can see, I'm, uh...

1046
01:00:15,795 --> 01:00:16,795
What if we just...

1047
01:00:16,995 --> 01:00:18,695
I think I've got the power to teleport.

1048
01:00:18,795 --> 01:00:20,495
Oh! Okay.

1049
01:00:20,595 --> 01:00:24,995
Whew! I'm gonna get the camera.

1050
01:00:25,695 --> 01:00:27,595
What'd you guys think of the Hell Temple?

1051
01:00:27,895 --> 01:00:30,395
I figured maybe we could move right along, though.

1052
01:00:30,595 --> 01:00:33,295
Um, there's some secrets around the Hell Temple...

1053
01:00:33,395 --> 01:00:35,595
...that I think we'll leave for a little bit later.

1054
01:00:35,695 --> 01:00:39,895
But for now, I wanted to say,
do you guys see that hand over here?

1055
01:00:40,495 --> 01:00:41,395
What is this?!

1056
01:00:41,595 --> 01:00:43,595
This is some end-of-the-world stuff.

1057
01:00:43,795 --> 01:00:44,595
Look at that.

1058
01:00:46,895 --> 01:00:48,095
Do you see that hand?

1059
01:00:48,295 --> 01:00:49,895
It's just, what's the hand doing there?

1060
01:00:49,995 --> 01:00:53,195
What if I were to stand on the hand
and do some poses?

1061
01:00:53,395 --> 01:00:57,595
Maybe we can get some poses of me
standing on the hand.

1062
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:01,395
This is like some, some Evangelion stuff.

1063
01:01:01,495 --> 01:01:06,395
You know, it's just me and my skeleton
at the end of the world, standing on a hand.

1064
01:01:06,595 --> 01:01:08,995
What the hand doin'? What the hand doin'?

1065
01:01:09,195 --> 01:01:12,295
Let me pull my deadbeats closer to me.
Hang on a second.

1066
01:01:12,495 --> 01:01:14,595
Uh, okay, pull, I'm pulling you closer.

1067
01:01:14,695 --> 01:01:17,095
I'm reeling you in like you're a fish on a hook.

1068
01:01:17,395 --> 01:01:18,695
Giant skelly!

1069
01:01:18,795 --> 01:01:21,595
Yeah, let's grab some screenshots if you want.

1070
01:01:21,795 --> 01:01:24,195
This is Mori Calliope posing on a hand.

1071
01:01:24,395 --> 01:01:26,395
Wait, I should do something super whimsical.

1072
01:01:26,495 --> 01:01:29,495
What if I did a pose with like,
no eyeballs or something?

1073
01:01:29,595 --> 01:01:30,295
Hang on.

1074
01:01:31,295 --> 01:01:34,095
'Cause that could be fun. No eyes!

1075
01:01:35,595 --> 01:01:36,595
What she doin'?

1076
01:01:37,395 --> 01:01:38,995
What she doin' on the hand?

1077
01:01:39,695 --> 01:01:43,095
What she doin' on—did you know I could
stretch my leg this far—

1078
01:01:43,195 --> 01:01:44,395
Oh god, I'm gonna fall!

1079
01:01:44,595 --> 01:01:47,095
No, it's no problem.
I'm just being super whimsical.

1080
01:01:47,195 --> 01:01:48,795
I'm being super whimsical.

1081
01:01:49,195 --> 01:01:51,495
Do a backflip! I can't. I can't.

1082
01:01:51,595 --> 01:01:54,795
The tracking is just too, too good over here.
It's too good.

1083
01:01:54,995 --> 01:01:59,695
It's not possible. I'm too busy
doing real body tracking.

1084
01:02:00,195 --> 01:02:03,195
Anyway, you guys want to...
let me get my eyes back.

1085
01:02:03,295 --> 01:02:05,295
Ugh, it's been a crazy day, huh?

1086
01:02:05,495 --> 01:02:07,495
Well, let's, let's go ahead and check out the city...

1087
01:02:07,595 --> 01:02:09,995
...because there's some stuff here
that I wanted to look at, so.

1088
01:02:10,595 --> 01:02:13,295
Not just the hand, but check this out.

1089
01:02:13,395 --> 01:02:15,795
What is this little arena over here?

1090
01:02:16,395 --> 01:02:17,795
With all this de-brass?

1091
01:02:18,495 --> 01:02:19,995
Actually, the word is debris.

1092
01:02:21,995 --> 01:02:23,695
Maybe we can get a better look.

1093
01:02:24,195 --> 01:02:26,895
Hang on, would you guys like a better look
at this place?

1094
01:02:26,995 --> 01:02:28,995
'Cause I would like a better look at this place.

1095
01:02:29,095 --> 01:02:30,595
So what if we... Oh!

1096
01:02:30,695 --> 01:02:32,995
Hey guys, I found one of those camera thingies.

1097
01:02:33,195 --> 01:02:35,595
Uh, if I press this button,
we might be able to get...

1098
01:02:36,595 --> 01:02:38,495
Ooh! Check it!

1099
01:02:39,695 --> 01:02:42,095
It's a dilap-dilapidated...

1100
01:02:42,195 --> 01:02:43,995
...dilap-titated city.

1101
01:02:46,795 --> 01:02:48,495
Is that big Papa Deadbeat?

1102
01:02:48,595 --> 01:02:51,595
Could that be THE Papa Reaper up there?

1103
01:02:53,195 --> 01:02:55,895
Was Adventure held here? You would think, right?

1104
01:02:56,495 --> 01:02:59,695
See, that's the kind of vibe
that I'm getting from this place.

1105
01:02:59,795 --> 01:03:01,495
This dilapidated city.

1106
01:03:01,595 --> 01:03:03,795
And that's a deadbeat being chained by his neck.

1107
01:03:04,195 --> 01:03:06,595
Maybe we could save him. I feel bad.

1108
01:03:06,695 --> 01:03:09,595
That's actually my house.
Oh god, I'm sorry, deadbeat.

1109
01:03:09,695 --> 01:03:12,495
I didn't mean to show your house like
that in front of everybody.

1110
01:03:12,695 --> 01:03:15,495
Oh, I'm sorry. Wait, that was an accident.

1111
01:03:15,995 --> 01:03:18,695
But look, people really could live here.

1112
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,695
Would I choose to live...
maybe I should build my house here.

1113
01:03:21,795 --> 01:03:23,695
'Cause I'm looking into building a house,
right deadbeats?

1114
01:03:23,795 --> 01:03:25,895
I mentioned that. Maybe I should
build my house here.

1115
01:03:26,195 --> 01:03:28,595
Oh! You guys want to see something cool, actually?

1116
01:03:29,695 --> 01:03:32,595
There's something that I haven't shown you
I can do with this outfit.

1117
01:03:32,695 --> 01:03:35,895
You're really close. I'm really close to you. Hi.

1118
01:03:36,895 --> 01:03:42,395
Check this out. Hold on, I'm changing. Don't look.

1119
01:03:44,995 --> 01:03:46,195
Okay, here we go.

1120
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:49,095
No jacket!

1121
01:03:49,695 --> 01:03:52,295
No jacket Mori Calliope!

1122
01:03:56,795 --> 01:03:57,995
Check it out!

1123
01:03:58,495 --> 01:04:00,295
My hands doing funny things.

1124
01:04:00,395 --> 01:04:04,195
Did you know that I have 50 extra
tendons in my hands?

1125
01:04:05,995 --> 01:04:07,395
Peace sign. Let me do a peace.

1126
01:04:07,595 --> 01:04:10,095
Peace! Handy-cam.

1127
01:04:10,695 --> 01:04:12,895
Gasp! Shoulder exposed. No way.

1128
01:04:13,195 --> 01:04:16,995
It looks pretty cool though.
Perfect for summertime, right?

1129
01:04:17,595 --> 01:04:19,995
Although I get the feeling if I put on the beanie...

1130
01:04:20,195 --> 01:04:23,195
...I would definitely look like a robber in that case.

1131
01:04:24,195 --> 01:04:25,595
What can you do?

1132
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:29,195
Nothing much, but summer just ended,
did it really?

1133
01:04:29,295 --> 01:04:30,695
I don't feel like it's ended.

1134
01:04:30,795 --> 01:04:32,595
I feel like we still got a ways to go.

1135
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:35,095
But back to the relevant subject here.

1136
01:04:35,595 --> 01:04:37,095
Back to the relevant subject.

1137
01:04:37,195 --> 01:04:39,595
We're in this dilapidated city.

1138
01:04:40,195 --> 01:04:41,395
Isn't this cool?

1139
01:04:41,495 --> 01:04:44,995
I'd love to just rest my legs,
but I feel like another memory's coming on.

1140
01:04:45,295 --> 01:04:50,495
You know? Another "I've been here before
and sang some songs with some friends."

1141
01:04:50,895 --> 01:04:52,995
So, would you guys like to see that?

1142
01:04:53,295 --> 01:04:55,495
Maybe we can both have a brain blast together.

1143
01:04:55,695 --> 01:04:57,195
Channel your third eye.

1144
01:04:57,295 --> 01:05:01,395
Channel the inner part of your brain
to remember things that you forgot.

1145
01:05:01,495 --> 01:05:03,095
That's something that I could really...

1146
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:04,210
...actually do more often.

1147
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:06,310
It'd be very helpful for me.

1148
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:07,510
But anyway,

1149
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:08,610
um,

1150
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:12,342
let's go ahead and run the memory!

01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:36,110
Cut your water ties.

1155
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:40,210
This ain't the only battlefield I can advertise.

1156
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:45,910
Ego isn't armor,
so put the camera down and face it.

1157
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:48,210
They want to get complacent.

1158
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:50,210
Come and lung with air,

1159
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:52,910
you say you stand for nothing no-one else can relate.

1160
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:56,210
Just know the company you keep
is in the business of hate.

1161
01:05:56,210 --> 01:05:58,210
Are you afraid?

1162
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:00,210
I'm close to getting paid.

1163
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:02,910
I'll be dancing on my own in a bulletproof vest.

1164
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:06,210
Going shoot shoot shoot, oh baby did you mesh?

1165
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:07,410
Ricochet,

1166
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:08,710
ricochet,

1167
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:11,410
you can think about me any time, of any day.

1168
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:13,410
Forget your street fights,

1169
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:15,210
this trench war.

1170
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:18,210
I'll make you mosh mosh mosh till you hit the floor.

1171
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:21,310
Getting thirsty for collision,
let them wonder what they're missing

1172
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,910
in the front row.

1173
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:23,910
Lock and load.

1174
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:24,910
Now here we go!

1175
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:26,610
This ain't a lifeline,

1176
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:28,210
it's a call to arms.

1177
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:30,210
Become the risen, the unforgiven.

1178
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:33,410
Make a decision if you're looking for
permission to write,

1179
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:34,910
you got it wrong.

1180
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:36,910
Say goodbye to your identity,
click flash, now you belong.

1181
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,410
Situation is fluid at all,

1182
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:42,910
took out my writers' paint and markers
and I ruined the wall.

1183
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:45,410
It's not that complicated,
I could choose to run but I crawl,

1184
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:48,910
just let the ankles of the skeptics
who I wish and we fall.

1185
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:51,710
I'll be dancing on my own in a bulletproof vest.

1186
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:55,210
Going shoot shoot shoot, oh baby did you mesh?

1187
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:56,210
Ricochet,

1188
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:57,510
ricochet,

1189
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:00,210
you can think about me any time, of any day.

1190
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:03,910
Forget your street fights,

1191
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:05,710
this trench war.

1192
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:08,410
I'll make you mosh mosh mosh till you hit the floor.

1193
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:11,710
Getting thirsty for collision,
let them wonder what they're missing

1194
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:13,410
in the front row.

1195
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:14,410
Lock and load,

1196
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:15,410
now here we go!

1197
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:17,210
This ain't a lifeline,

1198
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:18,910
it's a call to arms.

1199
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:20,710
Become the risen, the unforgiven.

1200
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:23,910
Make a decision if you're looking for
permission to write,

1201
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:25,410
you got it wrong.

1202
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:27,410
Say goodbye to your identity,
click flash, now you belong.

1203
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:44,410
Fighting all our battles now the kind too well,

1204
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:47,910
they go ready set rage and they follow us to hell.

1205
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,210
Finger on the trigger about to cock it and line,

1206
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:53,910
got a lyric in the chamber
but I'm aiming my own gun.

1207
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:58,310
Forget your street fights,

1208
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:00,210
this trench war.

1209
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:02,910
I'll make you mosh mosh mosh till you hit the floor.

1210
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:06,210
Getting thirsty for collision,
let them wonder what they're missing

1211
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:07,910
in the front row.

1212
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:08,910
Lock and load,

1213
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:09,910
now here we go!

1214
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:11,610
This ain't a lifeline,

1215
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:13,410
it's a call to arms.

1216
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:15,210
Become the risen, the unforgiven.

1217
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:18,410
Make a decision if you're looking for

1218
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:19,910
you got it wrong.

1219
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:21,910
Say goodbye to your identity,
click flash, now you belong.

1220
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:23,910
Ever onward.

1221
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:25,910
Lock and load.

1222
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:27,710
Stepping up to play the coward,

1223
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:29,410
step by someone you've devoured,

1224
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:30,910
it's a sick, twisted mess,

1225
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:32,410
created existence.

1226
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:34,410
Ever onward.

1227
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,410
Lock and load.

1228
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,310
Stepping up to play the coward,

1229
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:39,910
step by someone you've devoured,

1230
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:41,410
it's a sick, twisted mess,

1231
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:42,910
created existence.

1232
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:45,210
Ever onward...

1233
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:58,610
Errors creeping through the core.

1234
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:00,710
Protocols failing.

1235
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:05,210
System collapse in 3, 2, 1.

1236
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:15,910
La la la...

1237
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:10,410
OVER//RIDE

1240
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:18,210
はずれたノイズの無い側で
On the side where there's no stray noise

1241
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:20,710
Just to face another delete

1242
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:23,710
模良も正義も立たない Of course
Of course, neither virtue nor justice stands

1243
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,410
洒落たらぬ Rewind, what is mine?
An unstylish rewind, what is mine?

1244
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:29,010
最深蝕む Parasite
Parasite eroding the deepest part

1245
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:31,810
Just watch the dance 絹抜ける
Just watch the dance, slipping through silk

1246
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:34,110
Echo 伝播 Glitching mind
Echo propagating, glitching mind

1247
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:36,110
Mirror mirror mirror

1248
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:38,210
何度終わっても
No matter how many times it ends

1249
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:40,210
何度壊されても
No matter how many times it's broken

1250
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,910
それでもまだ
Even so, still

1251
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:44,110
戦え 抗え 進め
Fight, resist, move forward

1252
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:47,110
根性を宿して
With guts in your soul

1253
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:51,210
OVER//RIDE, OVER//RIDE ゼロの光放つへと
OVER//RIDE, OVER//RIDE, towards emitting zero light

1254
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:54,110
この狂った世界で
In this crazy world

1255
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:57,310
証明を叫ぶ
Shout out the proof

1256
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:00,110
No rewind, no reset その先に
No rewind, no reset, beyond that

1257
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:02,045
咲く花が
The blooming flowers...

1258
01:10:01,765 --> 01:10:05,265
狂っちゃいない 選んだ道だ
I go, I ride, I'll go bright.
I'm not crazy, it's the path I chose
I go, I ride, I'll go bright.

1259
01:10:05,965 --> 01:10:10,265
I go, I rise, overbright
We fall, we rise, we override.

1260
01:10:15,565 --> 01:10:17,765
Feeling extra erratic,
can't expect nothing but bad

1261
01:10:17,765 --> 01:10:19,765
Lost inside nightmares,
set the fear, strip it big

1262
01:10:19,765 --> 01:10:22,765
Unleash emotions make us stares,
in the end going nowhere

1263
01:10:22,765 --> 01:10:26,265
Drowning, what's the truth?
Rise and break the chain!

1264
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:29,265
懺悔的行いのファイアウォール
A firewall of penitential actions

1265
01:10:29,265 --> 01:10:31,965
Just one more step go go go Gloria low

1266
01:10:31,965 --> 01:10:34,965
Cry out, break down those broken dream
Rewire rewire rewire

1267
01:10:34,965 --> 01:10:36,765
Never let you never up ああ でも
Never let you never up... Ah, but...

1268
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:40,265
何度閉ざされても
この手でまた
No matter how many times it's closed off
With these hands again

1269
01:10:40,265 --> 01:10:43,265
つなげ えがけ
終焉の扉へ
I'll connect it, I'll draw it
To the door of the end

1270
01:10:46,765 --> 01:10:49,065
Override Override 灰の中から
Override Override, from the ashes

1271
01:10:49,065 --> 01:10:51,765
光を掴め
Seize the light

1272
01:10:51,765 --> 01:10:54,265
ただ 無慈悲な夜に
Just in the merciless night

1273
01:10:54,265 --> 01:10:56,965
真実をかざせ
Hold up the truth

1274
01:10:56,965 --> 01:10:59,265
No Rewind, No Reset 選ばれぬ道に

The flowers bloom

1276
01:11:02,065 --> 01:11:04,565
狂っちゃいない 選んだ道だ
I'm not crazy, it's the path I chose

1277
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:05,965
I go, I ride,

1278
01:11:05,965 --> 01:11:07,265
I'll go bright.

1279
01:11:07,265 --> 01:11:10,265
We fall, we rise, we override.

1280
01:11:20,565 --> 01:11:22,765
嗚呼 貸し出した世界で
Ah, in the world I lent out

1281
01:11:22,765 --> 01:11:25,765
これだけが響いた
Only this resonated

1282
01:11:30,265 --> 01:11:32,765
孤独を焼き尽くせ
Burn away all loneliness

1283
01:11:32,765 --> 01:11:35,265
限界を蹴り飛ばせ
Kick away the limits

1284
01:11:35,265 --> 01:11:37,765
宿命をねじ伏せろ
Overpower fate

1285
01:11:37,765 --> 01:11:40,765
Zero out despair now!

1286
01:11:43,765 --> 01:11:46,565
Override Override 天の子の声に
Override Override, to the voice of the child of heaven

1287
01:11:46,565 --> 01:11:49,065
響く声を上げろ
Raise a resonating voice

1288
01:11:49,065 --> 01:11:51,765
この痛みを抱いて
Embracing this pain

1289
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:54,265
最果てへ向かえ
Head for the furthest ends

1290
01:11:54,265 --> 01:11:56,965
No Rewind, No Reset カオスの先に
No Rewind, No Reset, beyond the chaos

1291
01:11:56,965 --> 01:11:59,565
咲く花がある
There is a flower blooming

1292
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:02,065
狂っちゃいない 選んだ道だ
I'm not crazy, it's the path I chose

1293
01:12:02,065 --> 01:12:03,565
I go, I ride,

1294
01:12:03,565 --> 01:12:04,765
I'll go bright.

1295
01:12:04,765 --> 01:12:07,265
We fall, we rise, we override.

1296
01:12:27,165 --> 01:12:29,265
She died!

1297
01:12:35,565 --> 01:12:38,765
Do you guys remember when Nerissa Ravencroft died?

1298
01:12:38,765 --> 01:12:41,265
Cause I do!

1299
01:12:44,265 --> 01:12:46,765
Uh, these have been really fun, these memories.

1300
01:12:46,765 --> 01:12:49,565
I've really enjoyed looking through them with you guys.

1301
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:52,265
I saw somebody in chat said "Help, is she on desktop?"

1302
01:12:52,565 --> 01:12:54,765
No, she's in the world with us!

1303
01:12:55,765 --> 01:12:59,565
But you know, a desktop is very helpful for folks who cannot...

1304
01:12:59,965 --> 01:13:02,765
...who cannot be present in the exact place...

1305
01:13:03,165 --> 01:13:07,265
...or do not have to have full body capabilities at the moment.

1306
01:13:09,265 --> 01:13:11,765
But you know, I think despite all the technical...

1307
01:13:11,765 --> 01:13:14,265
...technical walls that we've had, you know...

1308
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:18,565
...bringing this nostalgic trip down memory lane to life...

1309
01:13:18,565 --> 01:13:22,765
...everything... everything has been so interesting and fun the whole time and...

1310
01:13:23,765 --> 01:13:26,965
...and I'm just so happy to be able to spend that with you guys here...

1311
01:13:26,965 --> 01:13:29,265
...to show you guys this amazing creation.

1312
01:13:29,265 --> 01:13:32,765
Look at that deadbeat! Look at me and the dead- deadbeat. Don't be shy, come back.

1313
01:13:33,265 --> 01:13:35,265
There's a deadbeat.

1314
01:13:35,765 --> 01:13:37,765
There's the deadbeat!

1315
01:13:38,265 --> 01:13:39,765
That's a deadbeat.

1316
01:13:39,965 --> 01:13:41,965
That's a deadbeat for you.

1317
01:13:42,565 --> 01:13:44,565
Mori Callia-peak. I like that.

1318
01:13:44,765 --> 01:13:46,765
Can we start using th- You can if you want.

1319
01:13:46,765 --> 01:13:49,265
I- I won't say it, but... if you want to.

1320
01:13:49,565 --> 01:13:50,765
Makes me happy, it makes me happy that you enjoy...

1321
01:13:50,765 --> 01:13:53,265
What if I jump? I'm jumping.

1322
01:13:53,765 --> 01:13:56,765
Seeing if that makes a difference in anything.

1323
01:13:56,965 --> 01:14:01,765
Like if the camera can really handle the... the full capacity of my jumps.

1324
01:14:02,565 --> 01:14:06,765
Anyway, we're kind of... we don't have all the time in the world, but you know we...

1325
01:14:07,265 --> 01:14:09,965
...if we want to look at secrets...

1326
01:14:10,265 --> 01:14:14,265
If we want to look at the secrets, we probably gotta get moving a little bit.

1327
01:14:15,265 --> 01:14:18,765
But there's one... there's one special secret that I want to look at...

1328
01:14:19,265 --> 01:14:23,765
...before we move on to the Faded Atlantis that I'm really excited about checking out.

1329
01:14:23,765 --> 01:14:25,765
Do you guys want to go?

1330
01:14:25,765 --> 01:14:28,265
If you don't know where it is, you may have noticed...

1331
01:14:28,265 --> 01:14:32,265
...if you look yonder, if you look way over there...

1332
01:14:32,565 --> 01:14:36,765
...you can see that there's a black square in the... in the cliffside.

1333
01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:40,265
Way over there in the cliffside of the Plaza.

1334
01:14:40,765 --> 01:14:44,765
So I was thinking maybe we could go there.

1335
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,765
There's a little secret over here.

1336
01:14:48,265 --> 01:14:51,765
Perhaps it leads to another memory?

1337
01:14:53,765 --> 01:14:56,265
I don't know, I'm kind of nervous. I feel like...

1338
01:14:56,565 --> 01:14:59,765
...what if this... well what if... what if we're not able to get back?

1339
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:02,346
The ominous square in the wall...

1340
01:15:02,346 --> 01:15:06,046
Typically if you see a—hidden walls, visions
of hidden walls. Maybe I should roll through.

1341
01:15:06,346 --> 01:15:07,946
Like Dark Souls.

1342
01:15:08,946 --> 01:15:10,346
Waka-kon-waka water.

1343
01:15:10,746 --> 01:15:12,346
Anyway, anyway.

1344
01:15:14,446 --> 01:15:15,546
Shall we go inside?

1345
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,146
Whoa!

1346
01:15:18,746 --> 01:15:19,646
Hey!

1347
01:15:22,546 --> 01:15:23,946
I know this place.

1348
01:15:29,546 --> 01:15:30,646
Do you guys know this place?

1349
01:15:31,046 --> 01:15:32,246
Do you guys remember?

1350
01:15:36,046 --> 01:15:38,446
Oh man, it's been a really long time, huh?

1351
01:15:38,946 --> 01:15:42,046
I know it, some of you were around
for for this, but...

1352
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:45,546
Remember when we had one of our... aw.

1353
01:15:48,046 --> 01:15:51,546
And see the banner? Happy
HoloMyth 2 year anniversary!

1354
01:15:56,146 --> 01:15:58,546
Blast from the past, right? All the memories.

1355
01:15:59,146 --> 01:16:01,846
Remember when we all sang and danced

1356
01:16:01,846 --> 01:16:04,946
in an interesting way on this stage?

1357
01:16:05,746 --> 01:16:08,246
And I remember we had so many
things to announce back then.

1358
01:16:08,746 --> 01:16:10,746
And we did it in 360 too!

1359
01:16:11,946 --> 01:16:14,446
So like people could—could use their phone

1360
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:17,546
and like sit in the center
and like rotate it around.

1361
01:16:18,046 --> 01:16:19,646
And they could look at their oshi the whole time.

1362
01:16:20,046 --> 01:16:23,446
I wonder how many Dead Beats
were looking mostly at Mori?

1363
01:16:23,646 --> 01:16:26,746
You don't have to though, because there are so many

1364
01:16:26,746 --> 01:16:28,346
wonderful people to enjoy and support, but...

1365
01:16:28,646 --> 01:16:30,546
...but if you did look at me lots, I'd be really happy.

1366
01:16:31,046 --> 01:16:33,946
I want to do something like
that again sometime, actually.

1367
01:16:34,046 --> 01:16:36,746
Kind of walking around this old place

1368
01:16:36,746 --> 01:16:39,046
and thinking that to myself, you know, like...

1369
01:16:39,846 --> 01:16:42,746
...it'd be really cool to do something like that again.

1370
01:16:43,246 --> 01:16:46,646
And then we can't forget the backstage, right?
You guys were allowed backstage...

1371
01:16:46,646 --> 01:16:48,546
...which is very special,
don't you think? Hold on.

1372
01:16:49,846 --> 01:16:50,946
Whoa!

1373
01:16:51,346 --> 01:16:53,546
Remember we had you guys sit—

1374
01:16:53,546 --> 01:16:55,546
we had you guys sit right there on this stool.

1375
01:16:56,746 --> 01:16:58,446
In this exact spot. Haha.

1376
01:17:00,046 --> 01:17:01,546
Back in the day.

1377
01:17:05,346 --> 01:17:08,746
It's all kind of dark and dimly lit now.

1378
01:17:13,346 --> 01:17:15,346
Since it was so—so long ago.

1379
01:17:15,346 --> 01:17:17,846
Somehow it still feels like home, you know?

1380
01:17:20,346 --> 01:17:23,946
I'd really love—I'd love for you guys
to be able to visit this spot, too.

1381
01:17:26,346 --> 01:17:27,946
But maybe you'll be able to.

1382
01:17:29,846 --> 01:17:32,146
Well, we'll talk about that a little bit later, but...

1383
01:17:32,646 --> 01:17:34,246
...I guess we better get out of here.

1384
01:17:34,846 --> 01:17:36,546
We got an Atlantis to look at.

1385
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:40,646
So, let's get—let's get moving, I guess.

1386
01:17:41,946 --> 01:17:44,546
As much as I would love to sit here

1387
01:17:44,546 --> 01:17:47,546
and just reminisce about everything
that's happened, right?

1388
01:17:48,546 --> 01:17:51,546
I think maybe we should go ahead and get moving.

1389
01:17:54,246 --> 01:17:55,046
Heh.

1390
01:17:57,346 --> 01:17:58,946
Before I get too sentimental.

1391
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:05,846
Let's go!

1392
01:18:08,746 --> 01:18:10,146
I'm happy you're with us, Calli.

1393
01:18:10,746 --> 01:18:11,946
I'm happy I'm here.

1394
01:18:12,846 --> 01:18:15,146
Thank you for making it fun to be here.

1395
01:18:17,846 --> 01:18:20,346
Well, well it's a happy occasion, right?

1396
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:23,246
We should be—we should be
happy and excited for the future.

1397
01:18:23,646 --> 01:18:26,546
So let's—let's go! We're going, we're going.

1398
01:18:26,746 --> 01:18:30,246
But a moment of quiet reflection
is fun too, don't you think?

1399
01:18:30,746 --> 01:18:33,946
I think so. Oh, the way to Atlantis is kind of far,

1400
01:18:34,246 --> 01:18:35,746
so I hope you guys can keep up with me.

1401
01:18:36,246 --> 01:18:38,446
Get running, Dead Beats! We're running, we're running.

1402
01:18:39,046 --> 01:18:40,646
Woo! Woo!

1403
01:18:41,046 --> 01:18:43,546
All this training I've been doing
and I still feel like I'm not

1404
01:18:43,546 --> 01:18:45,546
in enough shape to be doing this.

1405
01:18:46,246 --> 01:18:51,246
But we're going, we're going.
Atlantis time! Atlantis time!

1406
01:18:51,346 --> 01:18:53,546
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Ikuzo!

1407
01:18:56,746 --> 01:18:58,446
Oh, here we are. Tada!

1408
01:18:59,846 --> 01:19:00,846
Okay.

1409
01:19:01,246 --> 01:19:03,646
This is another one of those... ooh.

1410
01:19:06,846 --> 01:19:08,546
Wait, check this out. Whoa!

1411
01:19:08,946 --> 01:19:13,446
That's Atlantis! Atlantis finally! At last,
we get to see it.

1412
01:19:13,746 --> 01:19:17,046
I feel like this is based off of
a room of a good friend of mine.

1413
01:19:17,546 --> 01:19:18,446
Mmm.

1414
01:19:21,346 --> 01:19:23,946
Do you guys remember Gura's Atlantis room?

1415
01:19:24,646 --> 01:19:25,946
It was based off of her.

1416
01:19:26,546 --> 01:19:28,146
Kind of makes me think about that.

1417
01:19:28,246 --> 01:19:31,146
Eh but what the heck is Council—is that Council Rys?

1418
01:19:31,746 --> 01:19:35,546
It might be Council Rys. I'm not totally sure, but...

1419
01:19:36,946 --> 01:19:39,046
...before we jump in there...

1420
01:19:39,346 --> 01:19:42,746
...I'm getting the feeling
that I've entered this place before.

1421
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:47,546
Well, shall we go ahead and take a look at another

1422
01:19:47,546 --> 01:19:52,446
musical couple—couple of musical memories before
we get too deep into exploring, shall we?

1423
01:19:54,646 --> 01:19:57,046
All right, Dead Beats. Play—run the memor—

1424
01:19:58,446 --> 01:20:01,246
I'm having a brain blast! If
you could gaze into the past—

1425
01:20:02,661 --> 01:20:04,061
Next, here it goes.

1426
01:20:04,561 --> 01:20:05,661
Let's do it then.

1427
01:20:12,761 --> 01:20:15,461
Wait... is this supposed to be Atlantis?

1428
01:20:15,961 --> 01:20:17,761
Man, so many memories.

1429
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:20,761
I remember Atlantis. I remember all the places...

1430
01:20:20,861 --> 01:20:24,061
...that we had in the original, the original VRC Myth map.

1431
01:20:25,861 --> 01:20:28,061
This brings back a lot of memories.

1432
01:20:28,261 --> 01:20:30,361
There's something kind of different though, right?

1433
01:20:30,461 --> 01:20:33,061
There's something kind of different about this place.

1434
01:20:34,261 --> 01:20:38,761
Like, um... who, who are those people over there?

1435
01:20:41,361 --> 01:20:43,461
I think I know these people.

1436
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:45,361
Familiar faces all around me...

1437
01:20:45,461 --> 01:20:47,261
...familiar faces.

1438
01:20:47,361 --> 01:20:49,761
I want to sing a song with someone here though.

1439
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:52,261
Who would I sing with here, I wonder?

1440
01:20:53,261 --> 01:20:54,761
Wait, I am up here!

1441
01:20:55,861 --> 01:20:58,461
Wait a minute, what? Is that... is that Biboo?

1442
01:20:58,561 --> 01:21:00,461
I'm up here!

1443
01:21:00,561 --> 01:21:03,761
Wait, I see a rock. There's a rock way up there.

1444
01:21:03,861 --> 01:21:06,461
I'm coming down! I'm coming down!

1445
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:08,461
Yeah, come on! Yeah, no problem.

1446
01:21:08,561 --> 01:21:10,261
There's a lot of stairs. There's a lot of...

1447
01:21:10,361 --> 01:21:12,761
Oh, okay. I guess she doesn't care about the stairs.

1448
01:21:12,861 --> 01:21:15,261
Ah! Oh God, ah!

1449
01:21:17,761 --> 01:21:20,061
Dang, you freaking came in like a wrecking ball there.

1450
01:21:20,161 --> 01:21:21,061
Hi Biboo.

1451
01:21:21,161 --> 01:21:22,061
Hi! Hi!

1452
01:21:23,261 --> 01:21:24,461
You're so small.

1453
01:21:24,561 --> 01:21:26,061
Nice outfit!

1454
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:28,761
Thank you! My brand new, my brand new digs.

1455
01:21:28,861 --> 01:21:30,461
What do you think? My new gear.

1456
01:21:30,561 --> 01:21:32,761
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1457
01:21:32,861 --> 01:21:35,461
Whoa there! Don't get too close there, skipper.

1458
01:21:35,561 --> 01:21:36,761
Hold on a second.

1459
01:21:37,761 --> 01:21:38,761
No, no, no, no.

1460
01:21:38,861 --> 01:21:42,061
You're like not the first person to do this today, I think.

1461
01:21:43,261 --> 01:21:47,061
You look so good! Look at you! You look so nice!

1462
01:21:47,161 --> 01:21:49,061
Thank you! I appreciate...

1463
01:21:49,161 --> 01:21:52,061
You look... we look like we're in the same band or something like that.

1464
01:21:53,761 --> 01:21:56,061
What the heck? Look at her, she's voguing.

1465
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:57,461
Oh my god, I can vogue too.

1466
01:21:57,561 --> 01:22:01,261
Eh-heh! Eh-heh! Eh-heh! Eh-heh!

1467
01:22:02,361 --> 01:22:04,461
No, I'm not as good as she is.

1468
01:22:04,561 --> 01:22:06,761
But you know what? I think we should sing a song together.

1469
01:22:06,861 --> 01:22:08,061
Do you want to sing a song?

1470
01:22:08,161 --> 01:22:09,761
Yeah! Let's sing a song together!

1471
01:22:09,861 --> 01:22:12,761
We should sing... we should sing something really intense.

1472
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:15,061
We should sing like, like a hard rock song if you want.

1473
01:22:15,261 --> 01:22:16,261
Like camping?

1474
01:22:16,361 --> 01:22:19,261
Uh... no. No camping. No camping.

1475
01:22:19,361 --> 01:22:21,261
You said it because 'in tents'... like camping?

1476
01:22:24,261 --> 01:22:27,261
Biboo... Biboo... Stop.

1477
01:22:27,361 --> 01:22:30,261
You're reminding me of Ina right now with the puns.

1478
01:22:30,361 --> 01:22:33,761
Oh my god. I should smack you, but I won't. I won't.

1479
01:22:34,261 --> 01:22:35,461
I'll be serious!

1480
01:22:35,561 --> 01:22:38,061
Yeah, just a little. It doesn't have to be too serious.

1481
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:39,761
Just serious enough, right?

1482
01:22:40,461 --> 01:22:43,761
Alright! Let's run it then! Play music!

1483
01:22:44,761 --> 01:22:48,761
Done made us say this!

1484
01:22:50,761 --> 01:23:00,261

覚悟、微調整
Resolve, fine-tuning

1489

I can turn the point kind of place any bets

1490
01:23:08,861 --> 01:23:11,761
Decide who is fragile and discard the rest

1491
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:14,761
Gambler by nature, chips start to stack

1492
01:23:14,861 --> 01:23:17,761
Raising lovely animals until they crack

1493
01:23:17,861 --> 01:23:19,061
祭脳、災能
Festival brain, disaster ability

1494
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:20,261
繁殖寄生体
Breeding parasite

1495
01:23:20,361 --> 01:23:22,761
You're indirect and done made us say this

1496
01:23:22,861 --> 01:23:25,261
Workout, breakdown, toss 'em when you've had enough

1497
01:23:25,361 --> 01:23:28,461
Yo choice, each choice I can tell you're not impressed

1498
01:23:36,361 --> 01:23:38,461
右向け右、左向け左
Turn right, turn left

1499
01:23:38,561 --> 01:23:41,461
Leave the defective, unworthy of investment

1500
01:23:41,561 --> 01:23:44,761
I can turn the point kind of hot mess worthless dog

1501
01:23:46,461 --> 01:23:48,261
寄って集まって射る者よ
Those who swarm and shoot

1502
01:23:48,361 --> 01:23:51,061
Gambler by nature, chips start to stack

1503
01:23:51,161 --> 01:23:54,261
Raising lovely animals until they crack

1504
01:23:54,361 --> 01:23:56,261
Beautiful dreams evade notice heart

1505
01:23:56,361 --> 01:23:58,761
Close your eyes and dial sys back

1506
01:23:58,861 --> 01:24:00,061
祭脳、災能
Festival brain, disaster ability

1507
01:24:00,161 --> 01:24:02,261
外れろゴミ共
Get lost, you trash

1508
01:24:02,361 --> 01:24:04,761
Done made us have no regret to be this

1509
01:24:04,861 --> 01:24:07,761
More way, starving、時間の無駄、無駄、無駄
More way, starving, a waste of time, time, time

1510
01:24:07,861 --> 01:24:10,761
Yo choice, each choice I can tell you're not impressed

1511
01:24:12,761 --> 01:24:17,761
あっちもこっちもこじらせたサイコ
Psychos everywhere, out of hand

1512
01:24:17,861 --> 01:24:22,761
お道化になりそう、どうにでもなりそう

Outside the stage, only just, travel paradise all for me

1514
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:29,761
I also night gallery、横からでも登って見下してやろわ
I also night gallery, climbing from the side, I'll look down on you

1515
01:25:00,976 --> 01:25:03,476
目を開けて　先取りのハレ
Open your eyes, anticipating the celebration

1516
01:25:03,476 --> 01:25:05,876
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

1517
01:25:05,876 --> 01:25:10,976
ハッとして　駆け出す花開くわ
Taken aback, I start running, flowers bloom

1518
01:25:35,976 --> 01:25:41,976
Wanted, Wasted
All Produced by Takuya Yamanaka (THE ORAL CIGARETTES)

01:25:41,976 --> 01:25:47,976
Lyrics by Takuya Yamanaka (THE ORAL CIGARETTES) / Yuki Tsujimura / Mori Calliope

1520
01:25:51,076 --> 01:25:56,176
I guess I’ll take the lead, no turning back
Point to take a look at deep inside

1521
01:25:56,176 --> 01:25:58,776
The cheat to exploit in your eyes,
my guards, my size, my dice, my drama

1522
01:25:58,776 --> 01:25:59,776
Cross it out!

1523
01:25:59,776 --> 01:26:04,876
Wanted, wasted, sorry to face it
we can’t stop falling down

1524
01:26:04,876 --> 01:26:09,876
Tell me I'm worthless, show you I'm nervous
One man's treasure's another man's surface

1525
01:26:11,476 --> 01:26:18,276
愛されたいのに愛せない　夢を見てるのは何故？
I want to be loved but I can't love, why am I dreaming?

1526
01:26:18,276 --> 01:26:24,176
変えたい現実　無惨なクソ　荒んで　ハミになる
The reality I want to change is miserable crap,
growing desolate, I'm becoming a misfit

1527
01:26:24,576 --> 01:26:30,776
やってやって　やってそのまま気づいちゃって
既得権益　奪い合うエンディング
Do it, do it, just like that realize it
The ending where vested interests are fought over

1528
01:26:30,776 --> 01:26:32,876
縁から逃げ出さないアンドロ
Android that won't run away from connections

1529
01:26:32,876 --> 01:26:35,476
援助はそれまでだ貸し借りに仕上げて頂戴
Support ends there, please finish it
with lending and borrowing

1530
01:26:35,476 --> 01:26:38,276
明快アンダーテイカー　仰天影喰らえ
Clear undertaker, eat the amazing shadow

1531
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:44,076
Ah, ah, ah, ah, 響けメーデー　メーデー
Ah, ah, ah, ah, resound Mayday, Mayday

1532
01:26:44,076 --> 01:26:50,976
タンタンタンタン　鳴らす
聞こえないふりして逃げられると思ってんの？ クソ
Tap, tap, tap, tap, making a sound.
Do you think you can escape by pretending not to hear? Sh*t.

1533
01:26:51,576 --> 01:26:58,276
愛されたいのに愛せない　夢を見てるのは何故？
I want to be loved but I can't love, why am I dreaming?

1534
01:26:58,276 --> 01:27:04,176
変えたい現実　無惨なクソ　荒んで　ハミになる
The reality I want to change is miserable crap,
growing desolate, I'm becoming a misfit

1535
01:27:16,476 --> 01:27:21,176
Oh my god, oh my god... Oh my god, oh my god...

1536
01:27:28,976 --> 01:27:30,076
気づいちゃった
I've realized

1537
01:27:42,476 --> 01:27:43,976
魂！
Soul!

1538
01:27:44,076 --> 01:27:50,776
愛されたいのに愛せない　夢を見てるのは何故？
I want to be loved but I can't love, why am I dreaming?

1539
01:27:50,776 --> 01:27:56,176
変えたい現実　無惨なクソ　荒んで　ハミになる
The reality I want to change is miserable crap,
growing desolate, I'm becoming a misfit

1540
01:28:10,976 --> 01:28:15,276
足りない　足りない　足りない　足りない
Not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough

1541
01:28:15,276 --> 01:28:21,476
足りない　足りない　足りない　足りない
Not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough

1542
01:28:21,476 --> 01:28:27,476
足りない　足りない　足りない　足りない
Not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough

1543
01:28:27,476 --> 01:28:34,176
足りない　足りない　足りない　足りない！
Not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough!

1544
01:28:42,076 --> 01:28:45,176
Yeah, yeah, dead beats, I know you saw that...

1545
01:28:45,176 --> 01:28:49,276
You saw Staff-san flying around with the mute button.

1546
01:28:49,276 --> 01:28:54,876
Can you guess which, which memory song we, we sung first?

1547
01:28:54,876 --> 01:29:03,076
But in all seriousness, I want to give a huge shout-out to all the staff
that worked really, really hard on all of this.

1548
01:29:03,076 --> 01:29:08,376
Because honestly, this entire production—hold on, I'm working, I got this.

1549
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:14,176
Honestly, this entire production, the whole team, like in studio,
has been like five people.

1550
01:29:14,176 --> 01:29:18,276
And then everybody working on it behind the scenes is like three or so.

1551
01:29:18,276 --> 01:29:22,976
Compare that to like the 30 plus people
that work on the really high quality productions...

1552
01:29:22,976 --> 01:29:28,076
...that they do for birthdays and stuff like that,
you know, your one, the one that you get to do every year.

1553
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:31,776
I was gonna say one free one,
but you only really get to do one, right?

1554
01:29:31,776 --> 01:29:38,276
Which is why I'm so glad that we did this together,
and I'm so grateful that it turned out the way that it did.

1555
01:29:38,276 --> 01:29:42,276
But, but hold on a sec, look. I want you to look...
Oh god, my jacket! Jacket!

1556
01:29:45,176 --> 01:29:48,776
Look at everyone, it's CouncilRyS!

1557
01:29:48,776 --> 01:29:53,276
This is a bit of a smaller, a smaller little performance area
compared to the others, but look at that Gura trident!

1558
01:29:55,376 --> 01:30:00,776
Although I will say, lady in the back,
is that supposed to be Gura? 'Cause there are some differences.

1559
01:30:01,776 --> 01:30:05,176
I'm sure that you all can...

1560
01:30:05,831 --> 01:30:07,131
Not now, not now baby.

1561
01:30:07,831 --> 01:30:10,031
Not now. But you never know.

1562
01:30:10,831 --> 01:30:15,331
I don't really know if that's something that she cared very much about, but...

1563
01:30:16,331 --> 01:30:19,131
Catching strays, catching strays.

1564
01:30:20,131 --> 01:30:24,331
Nah, but... I look really angry. Hold on, why do I... There we go.

1565
01:30:25,031 --> 01:30:29,031
Oh man. I hope that... I hope that my friends who...

1566
01:30:29,031 --> 01:30:34,031
...are no longer active with us anymore are living their best lives out there...

1567
01:30:34,031 --> 01:30:38,031
...and doing amazing cool stuff wherever they are.

1568
01:30:38,331 --> 01:30:39,631
You know?

1569
01:30:40,031 --> 01:30:42,331
That's what I want more than anything.

1570
01:30:43,331 --> 01:30:45,331
That would make me happy.

1571
01:30:45,831 --> 01:30:48,331
A lot of those faces around us here too. I really appreciate them.

1572
01:30:48,831 --> 01:30:50,831
I'm glad I got to get to know them.

1573
01:30:52,331 --> 01:30:54,831
And I'll keep watching 'em in my own way. In my heart.

1574
01:30:55,831 --> 01:30:58,831
Stop getting sentimental! It's getting later into the stream so it's happening.

1575
01:30:59,331 --> 01:31:02,331
We gotta move along though. We gotta move along because there's something that I really...

1576
01:31:02,331 --> 01:31:06,331
...I really think I need to show you. There's something really cool.

1577
01:31:07,331 --> 01:31:08,831
Follow... follow me!

1578
01:31:09,331 --> 01:31:14,331
Off we go! We're moving, we're... we're moving on up! We're going, we're going out of here.

1579
01:31:15,131 --> 01:31:19,331
There's... Oh, but really quick. I wanted to mention something. And I think that this might be a good place for me to announce this.

1580
01:31:20,331 --> 01:31:24,331
There's... uh, something... there's a little secret something-something below this area.

1581
01:31:25,331 --> 01:31:29,331
It's related to Mori. It's related to Mori but...

1582
01:31:31,331 --> 01:31:36,831
...there's a little... a little secret for Dead Beats to check out underneath this stage.

1583
01:31:37,331 --> 01:31:40,831
How... how would you be able to check it out though if we didn't see it today?

1584
01:31:40,831 --> 01:31:46,331
Well, that's because the plan is to release this world in the next few days...

1585
01:31:46,331 --> 01:31:49,331
...to you guys! So that you can hang out here with your friends...

1586
01:31:49,331 --> 01:31:53,331
...and explore around and just chill together.

1587
01:31:53,831 --> 01:31:57,331
And it'll be so fun! I hope that you guys will have a good time with it...

1588
01:31:57,331 --> 01:32:02,331
...and explore and find little secrets... um, like what we found or what we're finding today.

1589
01:32:02,331 --> 01:32:07,331
So make sure that you get a chance to and we'll make sure that you guys know where to access it and find it.

1590
01:32:08,331 --> 01:32:10,331
So that'll be really fun!

1591
01:32:10,831 --> 01:32:13,831
Um, let's go, let's go. Still things I want to show you.

1592
01:32:15,031 --> 01:32:17,631
Oh man, how far... Oh! You know what?

1593
01:32:18,131 --> 01:32:21,831
This is the place over here that... that I was most interested in running towards.

1594
01:32:22,331 --> 01:32:25,031
Come on, come on, come on! Let's go, let's go!

1595
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:28,331
We're moving, we're shmoving! Here we go!

1596
01:32:28,831 --> 01:32:32,831
Guys! Did any of you guys see this in the distance? The...

1597
01:32:33,331 --> 01:32:35,831
...the desert.

1598
01:32:36,331 --> 01:32:37,831
The desert!

1599
01:32:39,831 --> 01:32:43,331
The nerd run? Hey, don't say... that's not true! It's a very cool run.

1600
01:32:43,831 --> 01:32:47,331
It's a very cool run I'm doing right now. No, no, no.

1601
01:32:47,331 --> 01:32:50,831
My walking on the water, that's totally...

1602
01:32:51,331 --> 01:32:53,831
No, Chat, don't worry. It's just...

1603
01:32:54,331 --> 01:32:57,331
Geez... No, I'm not... I'm not J-man. No, Chat, wrong, wrong, wrong.

1604
01:32:57,331 --> 01:32:59,831
Chigau yo. 'Ame Desert?' question mark, question mark, question mark. Yes.

1605
01:33:00,331 --> 01:33:01,831
Yeah.

1606
01:33:04,331 --> 01:33:05,831
It looks kind of gray right now.

1607
01:33:07,831 --> 01:33:09,831
But here, let's take a look.

1608
01:33:11,831 --> 01:33:14,331
That's an Ame Desert.

1609
01:33:14,831 --> 01:33:18,331
That's the Ame Desert over there. And that big clock...

1610
01:33:18,331 --> 01:33:21,331
Do you guys think... you think there maybe something behind the clock?

1611
01:33:24,331 --> 01:33:26,631
Cause I want to go find out.

1612
01:33:26,631 --> 01:33:32,331
I want to see how far I can... I can dive into this place. But I get the feeling we might find something nice.

1613
01:33:32,331 --> 01:33:36,031
Really quick. Hold on a sec.

1614
01:33:36,331 --> 01:33:39,031
Oh, I'm excited, I'm excited! What are we going to find?

1615
01:33:39,331 --> 01:33:44,331
A bus stop? Question mark. There is a bus stop in the middle of the desert. We built one together in Minecraft... I knew it!

1616
01:33:44,831 --> 01:33:47,331
It's a dimensional door!

1617
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:49,831
Guys, look!

1618
01:33:50,331 --> 01:33:53,331
I found a dimensional door! Though I kind of had a feeling it would be here...

1619
01:33:53,831 --> 01:33:58,831
...and I may have gotten told by the powers that be that there was something back here.

1620
01:34:00,831 --> 01:34:03,331
But shall we go take a look together?

1621
01:34:04,331 --> 01:34:07,831
Let me take off this beanie, I'm sick of looking like a robber. It's very cute though.

1622
01:34:08,331 --> 01:34:13,831
I mean, I... the idea was mine to have the beanie on... Let's go into space together.

1623
01:34:14,831 --> 01:34:18,331
What? No, no, no. Whoa! We're in space!

1624
01:34:21,331 --> 01:34:25,331
Is it okay for me to be walking on this floor? I'm not gonna die, right?

1625
01:34:27,331 --> 01:34:28,831
Hey!

1626
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:32,331
Is this the original bus stop?

1627
01:34:33,331 --> 01:34:36,831
This is the original desert bus stop! It feels like... and everything is in the same...

1628
01:34:36,831 --> 01:34:40,831
...kind of lower poly style.

1629
01:34:43,831 --> 01:34:46,831
Another bus stop? Bus stop.

1630
01:34:48,831 --> 01:34:50,331
And then in here...

1631
01:34:50,831 --> 01:34:53,331
...something familiar?

1632
01:34:53,831 --> 01:34:57,331
Whoa! HoloMyth... one year.

1633
01:34:59,331 --> 01:35:00,631
Smol EN.

1634
01:35:00,452 --> 01:35:01,752
In a timeline.

1635
01:35:01,752 --> 01:35:02,952
This I didn't...

1636
01:35:02,952 --> 01:35:04,952
This is the original place.

1637
01:35:08,452 --> 01:35:09,952
We've got the Ina room.

1638
01:35:14,752 --> 01:35:18,452
I feel like I shouldn't be allowed to be here, but I want to sit down for like a cup of tea.

1639
01:35:18,852 --> 01:35:19,852
The original!

1640
01:35:22,452 --> 01:35:24,452
Look at that little Takodachi being so good.

1641
01:35:26,252 --> 01:35:28,452
And all Ina's paintings for all of us.

1642
01:35:30,652 --> 01:35:31,952
Memories.

1643
01:35:31,952 --> 01:35:34,952
Crying Yagoo statue, look at him, look at him cry.

1644
01:35:37,452 --> 01:35:38,952
We'll go in there in a second.

1645
01:35:39,452 --> 01:35:43,452
Then there's my old room! You guys remember my old room?

1646
01:35:45,252 --> 01:35:48,952
And the moon stage! Wow, from the Hell Temple, it's like the same...

1647
01:35:48,952 --> 01:35:52,952
...the same style and everything. Remember when I did a small concert here?

1648
01:35:56,452 --> 01:35:58,952
The Mori Cave.

1649
01:36:00,952 --> 01:36:03,452
Wow, it was so fun chilling out here with you guys.

1650
01:36:03,952 --> 01:36:06,952
I know it's kind of older now and a little worn down, but...

1651
01:36:07,952 --> 01:36:10,452
...I miss this old chill spot.

1652
01:36:10,952 --> 01:36:13,452
I wonder if we've got all of them here, oh my goodness.

1653
01:36:13,452 --> 01:36:15,252
We have time to check out all of them?

1654
01:36:17,452 --> 01:36:19,952
What's time looking like? We're gonna have to move on pretty soon,

1655
01:36:19,952 --> 01:36:21,452
but I don't want to! I want to keep looking.

1656
01:36:22,952 --> 01:36:25,452
Look, KFP Square!

1657
01:36:28,452 --> 01:36:31,952
Oh man, do you guys remember all the fun like Easter themed stuffs...

1658
01:36:31,952 --> 01:36:35,452
...or like spring themed stuff that used to happen? Was there an egg hunt?

1659
01:36:35,452 --> 01:36:38,952
I'm pretty sure there was a VRChat egg hunt once that we did in this kind of place.

1660
01:36:39,452 --> 01:36:42,452
And all the little games that we did as well.

1661
01:36:42,952 --> 01:36:45,452
Kiara did so much fun VRChat stuff too.

1662
01:36:45,952 --> 01:36:48,952
If I remember correct, memory serves, and I think it does.

1663
01:36:49,952 --> 01:36:51,952
Oh, memory serves correctly.

1664
01:36:51,952 --> 01:36:54,952
I feel kind of out of place here being in full color, but...

1665
01:36:55,952 --> 01:36:57,452
I feel old, dads, says chat.

1666
01:36:58,952 --> 01:37:01,452
Oh, it's not that long ago, it's only half a decade. Let's go...

1667
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:03,452
...to...

1668
01:37:05,952 --> 01:37:07,952
What we got here?

1669
01:37:08,952 --> 01:37:12,952
Oh, I guess that, yeah, there was the Ame desert and then Gumba's room.

1670
01:37:15,952 --> 01:37:18,952
Which we already, we already checked out Atlantis, but look...

1671
01:37:19,452 --> 01:37:22,952
...you can kind of see everything's kind of older and worn out here.

1672
01:37:23,452 --> 01:37:25,952
And the pillars too are kind of broken, but I remember it.

1673
01:37:26,452 --> 01:37:28,952
I remember what this place used to look like.

1674
01:37:30,952 --> 01:37:34,452
And it was so fun getting to explore all the different rooms too.

1675
01:37:35,952 --> 01:37:38,952
Oh, I can hear Right On Time right now.

1676
01:37:39,952 --> 01:37:41,452
It's really nostalgic.

1677
01:37:44,952 --> 01:37:47,952
Well, I hope that you guys get a chance to enjoy this world.

1678
01:37:48,952 --> 01:37:51,952
Cuz there was so much love put into it by Seafoam, thank you so much.

1679
01:37:52,952 --> 01:37:57,952
And thank you so much to Malin as well for working so hard on this. I love it!

1680
01:37:59,952 --> 01:38:02,452
I want to do my own exploring later. And then we can't forget...

1681
01:38:04,452 --> 01:38:06,952
You guys, here we are, the original Open Bar!

1682
01:38:06,952 --> 01:38:07,952
It's the bar!

1683
01:38:08,952 --> 01:38:13,452
Our old bar where we hung out and just chatted the days away.

1684
01:38:15,952 --> 01:38:17,952
All the silly stupid jokes.

1685
01:38:18,952 --> 01:38:20,952
In our small forms.

1686
01:38:22,452 --> 01:38:24,952
Everything's kind of decrepit now, but...

1687
01:38:27,452 --> 01:38:30,452
...the beginning, right? All the memories.

1688
01:38:30,952 --> 01:38:32,452
Movie nights.

1689
01:38:33,452 --> 01:38:35,952
We had a lot of fun watchalongs, didn't we?

1690
01:38:36,952 --> 01:38:38,952
The elevator, auditorium...

1691
01:38:39,952 --> 01:38:42,952
Remember... oh my gosh, wait, hold on.

1692
01:38:46,452 --> 01:38:49,452
Happy HoloMyth First Anniversary!

1693
01:38:53,952 --> 01:38:55,952
Yeah, four years ago.

1694
01:38:58,952 --> 01:39:00,452
Hi Mom!

1695
01:39:01,452 --> 01:39:03,952
Hey Deadbeats! Look at how much I've grown.

1696
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:12,452
We've all grown, haven't we?

1697
01:39:12,952 --> 01:39:14,952
Everybody was crying cuz we couldn't meet each other.

1698
01:39:14,952 --> 01:39:16,452
And then we did!

1699
01:39:18,952 --> 01:39:21,952
Man, half a decade, huh?

1700
01:39:22,952 --> 01:39:25,952
We should... we should get out of here before I get too emo.

1701
01:39:25,952 --> 01:39:26,952
Let's...

1702
01:39:27,952 --> 01:39:30,452
funny walk, funny run, ah ha ha!

1703
01:39:30,452 --> 01:39:33,952
So silly. We got barely any time left, but...

1704
01:39:33,952 --> 01:39:35,452
...I'm sure it'll be okay.

1705
01:39:36,952 --> 01:39:38,952
One last thing I wanted to show you is this place.

1706
01:39:40,452 --> 01:39:41,952
It's the ship!

1707
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:43,452
Sunfish ship.

1708
01:39:46,452 --> 01:39:48,952
You guys remember this place too? Remember our small adventures together?

1709
01:39:50,452 --> 01:39:53,952
Oh man, and we looked out here and we saw Sana was so big.

1710
01:39:55,952 --> 01:39:58,952
Yeah, and then, and then of course our captain was driving here.

1711
01:40:00,733 --> 01:40:02,033
Cool adventures.

1712
01:40:02,533 --> 01:40:04,133
The sunfish.

1713
01:40:04,233 --> 01:40:07,233
Maybe I should take this baby on a joyride.

1714
01:40:07,333 --> 01:40:08,733
I'm sure Ame wouldn't mind.

1715
01:40:08,833 --> 01:40:10,633
I'm thinking about it though,

1716
01:40:10,733 --> 01:40:13,133
especially after coming back here.

1717
01:40:13,233 --> 01:40:16,733
Well, I think we should quick teleport
back to the desert, guys,

1718
01:40:16,833 --> 01:40:18,733
since we don't have much time left.

1719
01:40:18,833 --> 01:40:20,233
I have teleport abilities though.

1720
01:40:20,333 --> 01:40:23,233
All I have to do is summon my persona.
Okay, here we go.

1721
01:40:24,233 --> 01:40:27,733
But I hope you guys get a chance to check
this place out in more detail, you know?

1722
01:40:27,833 --> 01:40:29,633
That would make me really happy.

1723
01:40:29,733 --> 01:40:31,533
Ah, we're back!

1724
01:40:32,233 --> 01:40:35,233
Because I feel like after all that we've
looked at so far

1725
01:40:35,333 --> 01:40:38,233
and all the memories that we've experienced,

1726
01:40:38,933 --> 01:40:42,233
there's a special song that I want to sing here.

1727
01:40:43,233 --> 01:40:45,233
But I have the feeling I already sang it.

1728
01:40:46,033 --> 01:40:48,233
Well then, shall we remember?

1729
01:40:49,233 --> 01:40:51,233
Let's go!

1730
01:40:57,233 --> 01:41:05,733
Last Days
Lyrics: Mori Calliope Track: benlussboy
Melody Composition: cocobunny

1731
01:41:10,633 --> 01:41:13,733
Castle made of thorns

1732
01:41:13,833 --> 01:41:17,233
Moon that rose and crimson

1733
01:41:17,333 --> 01:41:20,233
Groped for something more, all I got is distance

1734
01:41:20,333 --> 01:41:23,833
Driving ruthless, feels like the end of a light

1735
01:41:24,833 --> 01:41:28,033
Runnin' through the night, all of us our curses

1736
01:41:28,133 --> 01:41:31,233
Stuck here unalive, floatin' on the surface

1737
01:41:31,333 --> 01:41:34,733
Still in shallow, probably left to rot, I'm sinkin'

1738
01:41:37,733 --> 01:41:41,233
So close to giving up, giving out, giving in

1739
01:41:41,333 --> 01:41:44,633
Could I still live again, live again, live again?

1740
01:41:44,733 --> 01:41:48,033
But what's the point in fighting
when nothing lasts at all?

1741
01:41:51,533 --> 01:41:55,033
On your last day, standing here alone with you

1742
01:41:55,133 --> 01:41:58,333
I found my vision was untrue

1743
01:42:01,733 --> 01:42:05,033
Now I can wake up again

1744
01:42:05,133 --> 01:42:08,433
Don't tell me it's over

1745
01:42:08,533 --> 01:42:11,833
It must be, is it gonna be just me left behind?

1746
01:42:15,033 --> 01:42:18,333
Me and my mind

1747
01:42:18,433 --> 01:42:21,733
Forever wasting time

1748
01:42:22,533 --> 01:42:24,133
Back then there was nothing left to lose

1749
01:42:24,233 --> 01:42:25,733
Back then every night was wine and blues

1750
01:42:25,833 --> 01:42:27,433
That's when every pen I tried to use

1751
01:42:27,533 --> 01:42:29,133
Ended up leaking the weakness and bled through

1752
01:42:29,233 --> 01:42:32,433
All in past tense, mistaken, faking like I never

1753
01:42:32,533 --> 01:42:36,033
Was taken, waking up every night pacing

1754
01:42:36,133 --> 01:42:39,433
Walk down deep in my soul is what I really
want to shout now

1755
01:42:39,533 --> 01:42:42,933
Out of control but I still hold it inside

1756
01:42:43,533 --> 01:42:47,033
And now there's no way to hide,
you want to know if I'm fine

1757
01:42:47,133 --> 01:42:49,733
Well, at least nobody's dying

1758
01:42:49,933 --> 01:42:53,233
So close to giving up, giving out, giving in

1759
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:56,533
Could I still live again, live again, live again?

1760
01:42:56,733 --> 01:43:00,033
But what's the point in fighting
when nothing lasts at all?

1761
01:43:03,533 --> 01:43:07,033
On your last day, standing here alone with you

1762
01:43:07,133 --> 01:43:10,333
I found my vision was untrue

1763
01:43:13,733 --> 01:43:17,033
Now I can wake up again

1764
01:43:17,133 --> 01:43:20,433
Don't tell me it's over

1765
01:43:20,533 --> 01:43:23,733
It must be, is it gonna be just me left behind?

1766
01:43:27,033 --> 01:43:30,333
Me and my mind

1767
01:43:30,433 --> 01:43:33,733
Forever wasting time

1768
01:43:34,233 --> 01:43:37,533
Every now and then reality creeps in

1769
01:43:40,933 --> 01:43:44,233
Every now and then I glimpse of the deep end

1770
01:43:46,033 --> 01:43:49,533
You live once still, so when I'm not around

1771
01:43:50,133 --> 01:43:53,433
Remember me, remember what we found

1772
01:43:56,033 --> 01:43:59,533
On our last day

1773
01:44:02,933 --> 01:44:06,233
Standing here alone 'cause nothing lasts forever

1774
01:44:07,733 --> 01:44:11,233
Wake up, wake up yeah,
no I can't wake up, wake up yeah

1775
01:44:13,733 --> 01:44:17,033
No, it's not over, it can't be

1776
01:44:17,133 --> 01:44:20,433
Is it gonna be just me left behind?

1777
01:44:23,733 --> 01:44:27,033
Is this goodbye?

1778
01:44:27,133 --> 01:44:30,533
On my last day

1779
01:44:30,633 --> 01:44:33,933
Doesn't matter where or when I swear I'll find us

1780
01:44:37,333 --> 01:44:40,733
Some things...

1781
01:44:40,833 --> 01:44:44,033
'Cause I know some things just can't come true

1782
01:44:45,733 --> 01:44:49,233
But I want to see you again sometime

1783
01:44:49,333 --> 01:44:52,533
That song in my heart keeps me alive

1784
01:45:08,208 --> 01:45:10,208
Hey there Dead Beats.

1785
01:45:11,508 --> 01:45:13,708
Hey there. It's me.

1786
01:45:14,508 --> 01:45:17,208
It's okay to be sad.

1787
01:45:18,008 --> 01:45:21,008
It's okay to miss the people

1788
01:45:21,008 --> 01:45:24,708
who changed our lives if they aren't here anymore.

1789
01:45:25,708 --> 01:45:28,208
I think... it's okay.

1790
01:45:30,208 --> 01:45:32,708
But as long as we have memories, right?

1791
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:35,708
Um... then I think maybe...

1792
01:45:36,108 --> 01:45:40,208
just maybe, it'll be okay

1793
01:45:40,208 --> 01:45:42,708
even if we never truly move on.

1794
01:45:44,208 --> 01:45:48,208
Well, I'm happy that we have memories, right?

1795
01:45:49,208 --> 01:45:53,708
And to never, never forget all the stuff
that we did together.

1796
01:45:54,208 --> 01:45:57,008
Cuz we did some really amazing stuff,
don't you guys think?

1797
01:45:57,008 --> 01:45:58,708
I think we did.

1798
01:46:00,208 --> 01:46:03,208
And I don't want to forget any of that,

1799
01:46:03,208 --> 01:46:06,708
cuz like I said, I don't really have any plans
to get going anytime soon.

1800
01:46:08,208 --> 01:46:11,708
But I guess the way that I feel about it is...

1801
01:46:12,208 --> 01:46:15,208
I'd like to keep remembering all those people

1802
01:46:15,208 --> 01:46:18,208
and things that we did fondly,
regardless of anything.

1803
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:21,208
Even through the years,
and though they may pass by,

1804
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:24,208
and even when the wounds aren't fresh anymore...

1805
01:46:24,708 --> 01:46:27,708
I still... I still want to remember.

1806
01:46:28,208 --> 01:46:31,208
I know it's hard to... it's hard to move forward

1807
01:46:31,208 --> 01:46:35,208
sometimes when the things that we love
and care about are still behind us, right?

1808
01:46:35,208 --> 01:46:38,208
And stuck in the past.

1809
01:46:39,208 --> 01:46:42,208
But I'm gonna be here to make you smile
no matter what right now,

1810
01:46:42,208 --> 01:46:48,208
'cause there's still stuff I want to do, you know?

1811
01:46:49,208 --> 01:46:52,208
And yeah, that's a good point,
that good memories,

1812
01:46:52,208 --> 01:46:56,208
they should make you sad because...
because that means they were truly good.

1813
01:46:57,208 --> 01:47:00,208
We did a lot of really good stuff,
you guys think?

1814
01:47:01,208 --> 01:47:04,208
Well, I'm glad that I sang that here with Ina.

1815
01:47:04,208 --> 01:47:05,708
I'm really glad.

1816
01:47:06,208 --> 01:47:09,208
But there's still some people
that I haven't sung with,

1817
01:47:09,208 --> 01:47:12,208
so let's head to the final area, shall we?

1818
01:47:13,208 --> 01:47:17,208
What if I just, bam, teleported myself there

1819
01:47:17,208 --> 01:47:19,208
and used my crazy powers of...
Oh, my waist is broken.

1820
01:47:20,208 --> 01:47:23,008
That's okay. No, it's fine. All good, all good.

1821
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:24,708
I probably just need to T-pose real quick.

1822
01:47:25,708 --> 01:47:28,208
Hang on, watch this. Watch my sick T-pose.

1823
01:47:28,208 --> 01:47:31,208
Hang on. I'm already good at this.

1824
01:47:31,208 --> 01:47:33,208
I've become a pro at VRChat
in just this short time.

1825
01:47:34,208 --> 01:47:37,208
There we go. Fixed. All right.

1826
01:47:38,208 --> 01:47:41,708
Time to summon my persona
and head to the final area!

1827
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:45,208
Oh! Oh, we're here. We're here.

1828
01:47:45,708 --> 01:47:48,708
Oh, where'd my camera go? I lost it!

1829
01:47:48,708 --> 01:47:52,708
Is it hiding somewhere? Is it behind me?

1830
01:47:53,208 --> 01:47:55,208
Oh, I found it. There you are.

1831
01:47:55,208 --> 01:47:57,708
Found you!

1832
01:47:59,208 --> 01:48:01,208
Um, this is one of my favorite areas, I think.

1833
01:48:02,208 --> 01:48:04,208
You guys! You guys, look!

1834
01:48:04,208 --> 01:48:07,208
What is this? Green fields?

1835
01:48:07,208 --> 01:48:09,208
Oh! There's one of those camera thingies.

1836
01:48:09,708 --> 01:48:12,208
Hang on, okay. Uh, check this out.

1837
01:48:12,208 --> 01:48:16,708
Whoa! It's too beautiful!

1838
01:48:17,708 --> 01:48:21,208
Can you guys imagine hanging out
with your friends here?

1839
01:48:21,208 --> 01:48:23,208
Wouldn't that be so awesome?

1840
01:48:23,708 --> 01:48:26,208
I'm running up that hill.
I'm running up the hill.

1841
01:48:26,208 --> 01:48:29,708
Oh my gosh! Hey! Wait a minute! What's this?

1842
01:48:31,208 --> 01:48:34,208
Was Ina painting something here?

1843
01:48:34,208 --> 01:48:35,708
I didn't know about that. Heh.

1844
01:48:36,208 --> 01:48:39,208
I mean, it is a really nice scenery
to paint, I suppose.

1845
01:48:39,208 --> 01:48:43,208
So I guess it makes sense. I'd want to paint here. Hehe.

1846
01:48:44,208 --> 01:48:47,708
So expansive. Oh, sorry. Hang on...
That's okay, it doesn't matter.

1847
01:48:48,708 --> 01:48:50,208
So surreal and tranquil.

1848
01:48:51,208 --> 01:48:55,208
I guess this is a good place to tell
you guys the news

1849
01:48:55,208 --> 01:48:59,208
about a special thing that gets released
for anniversary, especially.

1850
01:48:59,708 --> 01:49:02,208
Do you guys know what it is?
Are we going to run the clip?

1851
01:49:02,208 --> 01:49:03,708
I think we're going to run the clip.

1852
01:49:04,208 --> 01:49:07,208
All right, guys, we have merchandise!

1853
01:49:07,208 --> 01:49:10,208
So I created a little commercial
before we get to singing here.

1854
01:49:10,208 --> 01:49:13,208
Run it, Sapsan!

1855
01:49:14,208 --> 01:49:18,208
Heh! Minna-san! It's been five long years
together, but we've done it!

1856
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:22,208
We made it to year five together!

1857
01:49:22,708 --> 01:49:25,708
And while the future's looking pretty
crazy and eventful,

1858
01:49:25,708 --> 01:49:28,208
let's take a little time to celebrate
the story thus far, shall we?

1859
01:49:28,708 --> 01:49:31,708
And what better way to do that than
with every Holo's bread and butter,

1860
01:49:31,708 --> 01:49:35,208
the bane of every Dead Beat's wallet's existence,

1861
01:49:35,208 --> 01:49:39,708
that's right, ev-erbode, it's time for
premium goods, goods, goods, goods!

1862
01:49:40,708 --> 01:49:43,208
Yeah, premium goods time. Now you guys,

1863
01:49:43,208 --> 01:49:45,208
you guys know what time it is. You get
ready for it every year, right?

1864
01:49:45,708 --> 01:49:48,708
And you guys know how I like to release merch

1865
01:49:48,708 --> 01:49:51,708
that's more on the fashionable side than practical,

1866
01:49:51,708 --> 01:49:54,208
but I think there are a few things that
you guys are going to love here.

1867
01:49:54,208 --> 01:49:56,708
And remember, if you grab it quick and manage
to cop the premium limited set,

1868
01:49:56,708 --> 01:49:59,208
you'll get a hand-signed postcard from me!
Horray! Happy!

1869
01:49:59,208 --> 01:50:00,774
But like always, supplies are extremely...

1870
01:50:00,356 --> 01:50:02,396
...extremely limited, so don't miss out, okay?

1871
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:03,467
Okay!

1872
01:50:03,556 --> 01:50:04,581
Okay!

1873
01:50:04,656 --> 01:50:06,356
First, we got a poster. Duh.

1874
01:50:06,456 --> 01:50:09,156
I mean, you guys expect posters by now, I think.

1875
01:50:09,256 --> 01:50:12,156
You guys are used to posters for me and as every

1876
01:50:12,156 --> 01:50:13,556
good Dead Beat knows,

1877
01:50:13,556 --> 01:50:15,856
Mori Calliope is a poster fan and Mori Calliope

1878
01:50:15,856 --> 01:50:17,156
fans are fans of posters.

1879
01:50:17,156 --> 01:50:18,856
I see your rooms. I know.

1880
01:50:18,956 --> 01:50:20,456
Not like in a creepy way or anything.

1881
01:50:20,556 --> 01:50:24,756
But this one's a bit smaller than the usual huge

1882
01:50:24,756 --> 01:50:26,856
posters that I always do for these merch drops,

1883
01:50:26,856 --> 01:50:28,456
but...

1884
01:50:28,456 --> 01:50:30,456
...it's to help with the shipping costs this year.

1885
01:50:30,556 --> 01:50:32,756
Uh, I don't know, we'll see. Crossing my fingers,

1886
01:50:32,756 --> 01:50:34,156
but no guarantees.

1887
01:50:34,256 --> 01:50:36,756
Throw it into your cart, see what happens, I guess.

1888
01:50:36,856 --> 01:50:39,356
I went for an Underworld live show concert poster

1889
01:50:39,356 --> 01:50:41,356
as a concept here...

1890
01:50:41,356 --> 01:50:44,556
...and my very own Yuki-same Mama created

1891
01:50:44,556 --> 01:50:46,656
something fun and energetic for the occasion.

1892
01:50:46,756 --> 01:50:50,356
So, let's reminisce on the amazing shows that

1893
01:50:50,356 --> 01:50:51,856
we've gotten to experience together...

1894
01:50:51,856 --> 01:50:53,956
...with this big-size poster! Yeah, yeah.

1895
01:50:54,056 --> 01:50:56,556
Next up, oh man, this one is big!

1896
01:50:56,656 --> 01:50:59,156
One of my favorite apparel artists, Crisalys,

1897
01:50:59,156 --> 01:51:01,556
has graced this humble black t-shirt

1898
01:51:01,556 --> 01:51:04,356
with a high-quality and subtle design of your Mori,

1899
01:51:04,356 --> 01:51:06,856
dressed in grimoire attire, playing her bass,

1900
01:51:06,856 --> 01:51:08,856
probably a little badly, in an antique shop.

1901
01:51:08,956 --> 01:51:11,956
It's the type of shirt where you probably get,

1902
01:51:11,956 --> 01:51:13,956
you know, compliments from fellow quirky folks,

1903
01:51:13,956 --> 01:51:18,056
but the average bystander, like, wouldn't look

1904
01:51:18,056 --> 01:51:19,656
twice at you kind of deal.

1905
01:51:19,756 --> 01:51:21,556
I don't know, again, I can't guarantee

1906
01:51:21,556 --> 01:51:23,356
exactly what's going to happen.

1907
01:51:23,456 --> 01:51:26,756
Anyway, you might find Dead Beats out

1908
01:51:26,756 --> 01:51:28,056
in the wild too, so that's fun.

1909
01:51:28,156 --> 01:51:31,356
It's just the kind of shirt that subtly expresses

1910
01:51:31,356 --> 01:51:32,756
your love for Mori Calliope

1911
01:51:32,756 --> 01:51:35,456
without being too, you know, in your face, right?

1912
01:51:35,556 --> 01:51:37,956
And the design is so, so, so good!

1913
01:51:38,056 --> 01:51:40,956
I own like five shirts by Crisalys,

1914
01:51:40,956 --> 01:51:42,356
now I'm about to own six.

1915
01:51:42,456 --> 01:51:44,556
Anyway, don't miss out.

1916
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:47,356
Next up, it's a Grimoire plushie!

1917
01:51:47,356 --> 01:51:48,556
Take her everywhere with you.

1918
01:51:48,656 --> 01:51:51,156
That's what seems to be all the rage

1919
01:51:51,156 --> 01:51:52,156
these days, right?

1920
01:51:52,256 --> 01:51:54,556
And if you give her a squeak, she says something.

1921
01:51:54,656 --> 01:51:56,856
Uh, I don't know what yet, but maybe we'll

1922
01:51:56,856 --> 01:51:58,656
all be a little surprised.

1923
01:51:58,756 --> 01:52:01,356
She's got such a cute and huggable design,

1924
01:52:01,356 --> 01:52:03,656
I'm sure she'll make fast friends with

1925
01:52:03,656 --> 01:52:04,956
your other plushies.

1926
01:52:05,056 --> 01:52:07,356
Especially... ugh, that weird cat.

1927
01:52:07,456 --> 01:52:10,556
You know, maybe you can dress her up and put her

1928
01:52:10,556 --> 01:52:12,156
in a plastic purse for a day out.

1929
01:52:12,256 --> 01:52:15,456
Just... just have fun. I don't know. Be whimsical,

1930
01:52:15,456 --> 01:52:16,756
whatever you want to do.

1931
01:52:16,856 --> 01:52:19,756
Finally, it's a concert and live show staple:

1932
01:52:19,756 --> 01:52:21,056
a casual wristband!

1933
01:52:21,156 --> 01:52:24,156
Show your support for your Mori in your everyday

1934
01:52:24,156 --> 01:52:26,156
life or at a local show,

1935
01:52:26,156 --> 01:52:27,856
even if, you know, I'm not the one playing.

1936
01:52:27,956 --> 01:52:30,656
Something easy to slip on and fun to rock out with.

1937
01:52:30,756 --> 01:52:33,456
I want to see all of you guys wearing them

1938
01:52:33,456 --> 01:52:34,456
at my future shows, okay?

1939
01:52:34,556 --> 01:52:36,156
And there's a voice pack too!

1940
01:52:36,256 --> 01:52:37,456
Mori Takes a Break?

1941
01:52:37,556 --> 01:52:39,856
Heh, what kind of title is that?

1942
01:52:39,956 --> 01:52:42,456
It sounds like some fan fiction to me,

1943
01:52:42,456 --> 01:52:43,956
but give it a listen, I guess.

1944
01:52:44,056 --> 01:52:46,156
Japanese and English voice available.

1945
01:52:46,256 --> 01:52:47,756
日本語もあります。
Japanese is also available.

1946
01:52:47,856 --> 01:52:51,456
Grab the full set and you will get a foil

1947
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:53,956
duplicated stamp on a special postcard.

1948
01:52:54,056 --> 01:52:56,756
Be really fast and get your hands on that

1949
01:52:56,756 --> 01:52:58,256
limited edition set,

1950
01:52:58,256 --> 01:53:00,556
and you might just get your hands on a

1951
01:53:00,556 --> 01:53:02,656
hand-written autograph from Mori Calliope.

1952
01:53:02,756 --> 01:53:05,356
Actually, it's not that you might, you will.

1953
01:53:05,356 --> 01:53:07,856
You will get a hand-written autograph from

1954
01:53:07,856 --> 01:53:09,256
Mori Calliope...

1955
01:53:09,256 --> 01:53:10,756
...if you're fast enough.

1956
01:53:10,856 --> 01:53:13,556
We always do gold though, so how about I sign it

1957
01:53:13,556 --> 01:53:15,556
with an extra special pink pen?

1958
01:53:15,656 --> 01:53:17,956
I don't know, I'll have to see if they let me.

1959
01:53:17,956 --> 01:53:18,956
Look forward to it!

1960
01:53:19,056 --> 01:53:21,856
And again, these are limited to a certain amount.

1961
01:53:21,956 --> 01:53:25,056
So, if you want to grab a real autograph from

1962
01:53:25,056 --> 01:53:26,556
your Mori, do not miss out on this chance.

1963
01:53:26,656 --> 01:53:31,356
The sales period will run for about a month, so

1964
01:53:31,356 --> 01:53:32,856
get your premium goods ASAP, okay?

1965
01:53:32,956 --> 01:53:36,056
It's like a full-on concert hall over here

1966
01:53:36,056 --> 01:53:38,056
between poster, t-shirt,

1967
01:53:38,056 --> 01:53:40,856
squeezable mini Mori, and wristband.

1968
01:53:40,956 --> 01:53:43,756
Get ready for lots more shows together,

1969
01:53:43,756 --> 01:53:44,756
Dead Beats!

1970
01:53:44,856 --> 01:53:48,356
And thanks for the unforgettable five years!

1971
01:53:48,356 --> 01:53:49,356
Whoa!

1972
01:53:49,456 --> 01:53:52,856
I wonder how much further can we go together?

1973
01:53:52,956 --> 01:53:54,556
I want to see!

1974
01:53:59,756 --> 01:54:00,756
Hello!

1975
01:54:00,856 --> 01:54:02,656
Thank you so much everybody.

1976
01:54:02,756 --> 01:54:05,556
I hope that you guys enjoy the goods. Please look

1977
01:54:05,556 --> 01:54:06,856
forward to receiving them.

1978
01:54:06,956 --> 01:54:08,856
They're very cool. I'm super excited with how

1979
01:54:08,856 --> 01:54:10,156
they turned out.

1980
01:54:10,256 --> 01:54:13,056
So make sure that you don't miss it.

1981
01:54:13,156 --> 01:54:15,456
I think the shop will open in about six minutes.

1982
01:54:15,556 --> 01:54:18,856
You'll be able to pre-order your merch and get

1983
01:54:18,856 --> 01:54:20,156
the limited if you're quick.

1984
01:54:20,256 --> 01:54:22,756
You gotta be quick because they do have

1985
01:54:22,756 --> 01:54:23,756
a limited number.

1986
01:54:23,856 --> 01:54:26,156
But yeah, please enjoy and thank you always for

1987
01:54:26,156 --> 01:54:27,056
supporting me so much.

1988
01:54:27,156 --> 01:54:30,356
There will be a members-only encore after this

1989
01:54:30,356 --> 01:54:31,456
featuring a few more songs...

1990
01:54:31,456 --> 01:54:33,556
...and just getting to chat with my members,

1991
01:54:33,556 --> 01:54:34,556
which I'm excited about.

1992
01:54:34,656 --> 01:54:36,856
Um, so please look forward to that.

1993
01:54:36,956 --> 01:54:38,556
And there's a new song coming out!

1994
01:54:38,656 --> 01:54:41,356
I should look a little happier about that.

1995
01:54:41,356 --> 01:54:42,556
There's a new song coming out!

1996
01:54:42,656 --> 01:54:45,356
And I haven't really given any hints about

1997
01:54:45,356 --> 01:54:46,756
what kind of song it is.

1998
01:54:46,856 --> 01:54:49,156
People are like, "Oh, it's gonna be so emotional,

1999
01:54:49,156 --> 01:54:51,456
this looks like an emotional song."

2000
01:54:51,556 --> 01:54:54,356
But knowing what the song is makes me

2001
01:54:54,356 --> 01:54:55,556
laugh really hard,

2002
01:54:55,656 --> 01:54:57,356
because it's actually a lot simpler than you think.

2003
01:54:57,456 --> 01:55:00,356
But something about my early music is that,

2004
01:55:00,356 --> 01:55:01,656
man, I was so honest, you know?

2005
01:55:01,756 --> 01:55:04,456
And so I wanted to write a song that not just

2006
01:55:04,456 --> 01:55:05,756
me, myself, I as a person could relate to,

2007
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:07,756
but anyone... anyone who has an oshi could
but anyone... anyone who has a favorite could

2008
01:55:07,756 --> 01:55:08,856
relate to.

2009
01:55:08,956 --> 01:55:12,756
And so I hope that you will enjoy it because it

2010
01:55:12,756 --> 01:55:14,156
feels like an older Mori song...

2011
01:55:14,156 --> 01:55:15,856
...while also being a newer Mori song.

2012
01:55:15,956 --> 01:55:18,756
It's hard to explain, but I guess you'll just have

2013
01:55:18,756 --> 01:55:19,756
to watch it and see.

2014
01:55:19,856 --> 01:55:22,756
MV is really cute, so we'll watch that premiere

2015
01:55:22,756 --> 01:55:23,856
together too,

2016
01:55:23,856 --> 01:55:25,356
so don't go anywhere after the credits.

2017
01:55:25,456 --> 01:55:27,556
Uh, please look forward to it.

2018
01:55:27,556 --> 01:55:29,256
New song, new song. Stream it lots!

2019
01:55:00,371 --> 01:55:01,404
Let's watch it live.

2020
01:55:01,404 --> 01:55:04,571
And um, share it around. I don't know, if you want, if you like it.

2021
01:55:04,571 --> 01:55:11,571
Um, but I still have one last song memory to replay in my mind here in this beautiful area.

2022
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:15,271
So shall we run it? The last song of today.

2023
01:55:15,271 --> 01:55:17,171
Thank you so much, Dead Beats.

2024
01:55:17,171 --> 01:55:19,771
Catch you on the flip side. There might be an after-credits scene.

2025
01:55:19,771 --> 01:55:21,371
Let's go!

2026
01:55:26,871 --> 01:55:30,371
Scuffed Up Age
Lyrics by Mori Calliope / Camellia
Music by Camellia

2027
01:55:30,371 --> 01:55:52,371
Ha-ah-ah... La-la-la...

2028
01:55:52,371 --> 01:55:54,971
Lost in thoughts, a frosted frame of mind,

2029
01:55:54,971 --> 01:55:57,771
Honest to God, it's just not our time.

2030
01:55:57,771 --> 01:56:00,571
Promises flawed by cosmic design,

2031
01:56:00,571 --> 01:56:03,371
コレクティブで手を取り合いたい
I want to hold hands in the collective,

2032
01:56:03,371 --> 01:56:06,371
でもな、無駄なあがきさせない
But hey, I won't let it be a futile struggle.

2033
01:56:06,371 --> 01:56:08,971
Coming of age, the stage doesn't light up,

2034
01:56:08,971 --> 01:56:11,771
Just right away they told us it might have.

2035
01:56:11,771 --> 01:56:16,171
夢はもう、諦めます
I'm already giving up on my dreams.

2036
01:56:16,371 --> 01:56:19,171
The cynical mind says why'd you try?

2037
01:56:19,171 --> 01:56:23,371
Why not give up and play the bad guy?

2038
01:56:23,371 --> 01:56:27,171
わかってるさ
I know.

2039
01:56:27,371 --> 01:56:30,171
運命が波立てながら
While fate is making waves,

2040
01:56:30,171 --> 01:56:32,771
あなたの元へするのなら
If I'm heading towards you,

2041
01:56:32,771 --> 01:56:35,371
崩れ落ちそうな体
This body that feels like it's collapsing,

2042
01:56:35,371 --> 01:56:38,171
抱きしめるから
I will hold you close.

2043
01:56:38,371 --> 01:56:41,171
We choose to know

2044
01:56:41,171 --> 01:56:43,971
The struggles of this scuffed up age,

2045
01:56:43,971 --> 01:56:46,171
We're living in go-sani

2046
01:56:46,171 --> 01:56:48,771
たくさんの
Many...

2047
01:56:48,771 --> 01:56:51,571
経験を糧と
...experiences as nourishment,

2048
01:56:51,571 --> 01:56:52,971
この夜明け
At this dawn,

2049
01:56:52,971 --> 01:56:54,571
口ずさむわ
I'll hum a tune.

2050
01:56:54,571 --> 01:56:56,371
Like not your days,

2051
01:56:56,371 --> 01:56:57,971
それでも
Even so,

2052
01:56:57,971 --> 01:57:02,371
あなたを救っていたいから
Because I want to keep saving you.

2053
01:57:02,371 --> 01:57:04,571
Can't find a reason to stay,

2054
01:57:04,571 --> 01:57:07,371
Some busted world led us astray,

2055
01:57:07,371 --> 01:57:10,771
Once just was left to decay,

2056
01:57:10,771 --> 01:57:14,371
We choose to go on anyway.

2057
01:57:21,371 --> 01:57:24,171
Lost in thoughts of an always changing face,

2058
01:57:24,171 --> 01:57:26,971
Allies and friends hiding more than one space,

2059
01:57:26,971 --> 01:57:29,371
Not really surprising, why are you compromising?

2060
01:57:29,371 --> 01:57:31,371
The sun is rising, a new horizon,

2061
01:57:31,371 --> 01:57:35,371
With friendships acting like lies and the knives in your back,
so what are you prioritizing?

2062
01:57:35,371 --> 01:57:36,771
You aren't sick of crying?

2063
01:57:36,771 --> 01:57:38,571
See, I don't buy it,

2064
01:57:38,571 --> 01:57:40,371
But here we are hanging on, fighting strong as spiders.

2065
01:57:40,371 --> 01:57:42,571
儚いじゃないわ しきれない
It's not fleeting, I can't finish it,

2066
01:57:42,571 --> 01:57:43,971
もう目ぇ閉じてしまいたい
I want to just close my eyes already,

2067
01:57:43,971 --> 01:57:45,371
暗いの世界
In this dark world.

2068
01:57:45,371 --> 01:57:47,771
The cynical mind says why'd you try?

2069
01:57:47,771 --> 01:57:50,371
Why not give up and play the bad guy?

2070
01:57:50,371 --> 01:57:53,371
Why not give up and play the bad guy?

2071
01:57:53,371 --> 01:57:56,571
わかってるさ
I know.

2072
01:57:56,571 --> 01:57:59,371
埃まみれの街で
In this dust-covered town,

2073
01:57:59,371 --> 01:58:02,171
あなたの溜息の影
The shadow of your sigh,

2074
01:58:02,171 --> 01:58:04,571
私の傘をないで
Don't take away my umbrella,

2075
01:58:04,571 --> 01:58:07,371
抱きしめたいから
Because I want to hold you close.

2076
01:58:07,371 --> 01:58:10,371
We choose to know

2077
01:58:10,371 --> 01:58:13,171
The struggles of this scuffed up age,

2078
01:58:13,171 --> 01:58:15,971
We're giving in go-sani

2079
01:58:15,971 --> 01:58:18,771
汚れだって
Even if it's dirty,

2080
01:58:18,771 --> 01:58:20,571
It really hurts to grow,

2081
01:58:20,571 --> 01:58:23,371
Believing in a world of fate is overrated,

2082
01:58:23,371 --> 01:58:25,371
までも
Even...

2083
01:58:25,371 --> 01:58:30,371
あなたを美しく謳うから
...so, I will sing of you beautifully.

2084
01:58:31,371 --> 01:58:33,571
Must be something surreal,

2085
01:58:33,571 --> 01:58:36,371
And in this dream we can heal,

2086
01:58:36,371 --> 01:58:39,171
This busted world built up real,

2087
01:58:39,171 --> 01:58:41,971
Someone remember the way it feels,

2088
01:58:41,971 --> 01:58:45,371
Like night the city feels dead but like...

2089
01:58:47,371 --> 01:58:53,371
The lights and sights and sounds are treasures.

2090
01:58:53,971 --> 01:58:56,571
こんな世界に
In a world like this,

2091
01:58:56,571 --> 01:58:59,171
抗って歩く
I'll keep walking and resisting,

2092
01:58:59,171 --> 01:59:03,371
力なんてさ
The strength for that...

2093
01:59:04,171 --> 01:59:08,371
私にはないけど
...is something I don't have, but...

2094
01:59:09,371 --> 01:59:12,571
Face up, this world can kill the inspired,

2095
01:59:12,571 --> 01:59:15,371
Why don't we turn this scuffed up page?

2096
01:59:15,371 --> 01:59:18,171
We're writing in

2097
01:59:18,171 --> 01:59:22,371
こんな世界じゃ
In a world like this,

2098
01:59:22,371 --> 01:59:24,771
Believe in the logic we know,

2099
01:59:24,771 --> 01:59:27,771
Kono yoake is rarely fair,

2100
01:59:27,771 --> 01:59:30,171
Decide your fate, it's your life,

2101
01:59:30,171 --> 01:59:35,371
あなたを美しく謳うから
Because I will sing of you beautifully.

2102
01:59:36,371 --> 01:59:38,571
Tomorrow's a brand new day,

2103
01:59:38,571 --> 01:59:41,171
Like all those optimists say,

2104
01:59:41,171 --> 01:59:44,571
But the truth is rather ruthless, it might be rain,

2105
01:59:44,571 --> 01:59:47,171
The question is will you bear the pain?

2106
01:59:47,171 --> 01:59:49,371
What's your reason to stay?

2107
01:59:49,371 --> 01:59:52,371
This shining world led us astray,

2108
01:59:52,371 --> 01:59:55,771
Won't leave it all to decay,

2109
01:59:55,771 --> 02:00:00,371
I choose to love it anyway.

2110
02:00:02,686 --> 02:00:06,186
Ahhh... Ohhh...

2111
02:00:06,604 --> 02:00:08,886
We chose to know...

2112
02:00:08,886 --> 02:00:11,486
...the structure of the scuffed...

2113
02:00:11,486 --> 02:00:14,186
...bit we live in...

2114
02:00:15,986 --> 02:00:19,886
...so don't give in...

2115
02:02:35,786 --> 02:02:37,486
What are you still doing here?

2116
02:02:37,486 --> 02:02:38,786
The show's over.

2117
02:02:38,786 --> 02:02:40,136
Go watch the music video!

2118
02:02:40,136 --> 02:02:42,786
Thank you Yoolies and Naneless for the 3D!

2119
02:02:42,786 --> 02:02:43,586
Bye!

2120
02:02:43,586 --> 02:02:47,386
Thank you all for 5 incredibly strong, wonderful, whimsical

2121
02:02:47,386 --> 02:02:50,886
at times painful but so, so special years as Your Mori.

2122
02:02:50,886 --> 02:02:53,886
There are so many more views I want to see,

2123
02:02:53,886 --> 02:02:56,886
but for now just know how thankful I am

2124
02:02:56,886 --> 02:02:59,886
that I get to be your pink woman. Always.

2125
02:02:59,886 --> 02:03:02,886
We laughed! We cried! We cringed.

2126
02:03:02,886 --> 02:03:05,886
—And we'll do it again, dammit!!

2127
02:03:05,886 --> 02:03:08,886
Mori Calliope - Happy 5 years.

2128
02:03:08,886 --> 02:03:14,986
Here's to more.
