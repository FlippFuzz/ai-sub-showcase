Someone as broken as me, holding my breath

ほどけない もうほどけないよ 真実さえ freeze
It won't unravel, it won't unravel anymore, even the truth, freeze

00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,500
壊せる 壊せない 狂える 狂えない あなたを見つけた

揺れて歪んだ世界にだんだん僕は 透き通って見えなくなって
In a swaying, distorted world, I'm gradually becoming transparent and invisible

In a lonely trap that someone set up...

無限に広がる孤独が絡まる
Infinitely spreading loneliness gets entangled.

34
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,233
無邪気に笑った記憶が刺さって
Memories of innocently laughing stab through me.

It's me, Mori Calliope from Hololive English -Myth-,

58
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:54,833
everybody's favorite hardworking Shinigami,

59
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:58,833
back in action today with a brand new show for all of you guys

60
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:02,033
that I've been working super, super hard for.

61
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:05,133
I hope you guys are as excited as I am.

62
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:08,533
This is my official-official, officially official,

63
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:12,333
my second birthday live, official 3D live show.

64
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,533
I hope you guys are super, super hyped for it because,

65
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:19,433
oh man, there's so much good stuff I can't wait to show you.

66
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,533
But there's a special rule for today's live.

67
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:25,833
And that rule is 'NO DOWN TIME', which means,

68
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:29,233
which means, I mean, there's no down time.

69
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:32,433
There's no slow anything, no slow songs,

70
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:35,333
no slow MCs, no slow Mori.

71
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,233
100% 派手にぶちかまそうぜ！みたいな感じ。
100% like "Let's kick things off flashy!"

72
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:41,233
Going real crazy. That's why you gotta use the hashtag,

73
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:45,033
#NODOWNTIME2024 and post a bunch of screenshots.

74
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:48,833
Can you do that? A bunch of screenshots and your thoughts,

75
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,833
screenshots and your thoughts about this show.

76
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:55,233
And I'd be really, really happy if you did that,

77
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:58,233
because we gotta lot of great guests,

78
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:01,333
we gotta lot of great performances, and not to mention,

79
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,533
we have a great stage.

80
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:06,533
Would you like to take a look at the stage with me?

81
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:10,533
Take a look at the Underdome... Underworld Dome...

82
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:13,433
I haven't come up with a name for it yet, but isn't it great?

83
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:16,633
It's a special secret place that I found in the Underworld,

84
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:19,433
where the moon sometimes comes down on the 4th of April,

85
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,533
which happens to be my birthday.

86
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:25,533
So I figured it would be the perfect setting

87
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:28,433
for all of us to have a great show together.

88
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:31,533
I invited a bunch of my friends, and it's gonna be amazing.

89
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:34,233
There's a lot of great surprises ahead.

90
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:36,533
Additionally, um...

91
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:39,433
I can see a bunch of you in the crowd,

92
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:42,533
I know you're cheering for me. Hey, what's up, skeletons?

93
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:46,433
Except you look a little more human-shaped. Congratulations on that.

94
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:49,233
But I'm looking forward to doing my best for you guys.

95
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:52,433
And as a matter of fact, the next song...

96
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:56,533
the next song is one that I know you guys have really wanted me

97
00:09:56,533 --> 00:10:00,033
to perform for a long time. And I did perform it before at Fes,

98
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,433
but this time, I want to try and perform it in a way

99
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:06,699
that is even more explosive and Mori-like in my own home.

100
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,845
I hope that you will enjoy it.

101
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:04,845
So everybody, please listen to the next song

102
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:08,545
which is my brand new song that you guys
should definitely stream and listen to a lot

103
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:11,845
if you haven't had time and check out the MV
for because the art is amazing.

104
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,045
That song is called Overkill.

105
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:15,545

310
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Crazy World

311
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:44,390
見えない心と確かに在る体
An invisible heart and a body that certainly exists

312
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:54,890
信じたいものを己に誓え
Vow to yourself the things you want to believe in

313
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:01,890
真実を捨てて走れ
Discard the truth and run

314
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,390
Where's my soul? Where's my heart?

315
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,390
その意志を信じて
Believe in that will

316
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,390
Don't hesitate, go this way

317
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,390
理解らない 構わない
I don't understand, I don't care

318
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,390
夢でも現実でも
Whether it's a dream or reality

319
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,640
ただこの世界を生き抜こう
Let's just survive this world

320
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,890
さあ何処まででもこの足が行く限り
Come, as far as these legs will take us

321
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,640
Misery World

323
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:22,890
Get get it up, get get it up
Get get it up, get get it up

324
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:33,390
Get get it up, get get it up
Get get it up, get get it up

325
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,840
本当はもう聞き飽きた 現実からの逃避
Truthfully, I'm tired of hearing it, escaping from reality

326
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,340
大体はエゴロジスト 悦に浸っていたいさ
Mostly ecologists, just wanting to indulge in self-satisfaction

327
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,140
迷宮なんてさ 願ってもない 叶やしないさ
A labyrinth, it's not even a wish, it won't come true

328
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,640
葬り去りゆく夜の心地は 非常に残酷な自問自答
The feeling of a night being buried is a very cruel self-questioning

329
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:59,390
幸か不幸かは 自分の眼にしか見えないさ
Happiness or misfortune, can only be seen through one's own eyes

330
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:03,390
No one gets close to me

332
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,390
どうなったっていい まだわからない世界で
It doesn't matter what happens, in a world I still don't understand

333
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,390
滲む Ah oh, Ah oh 叫ぶ
Blurred Ah oh, Ah oh I scream

334
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:19,390
どうなったっていいから 僕を壊さないで
I don't care what happens, so don't break me

335
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:26,390
醒ませ Ah oh, Ah oh 限界突破見せてやるさ
Awaken Ah oh, Ah oh, I'll show you how I break the limits

336
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:33,890
Get get it up, get get it up
Get get it up, get get it up

337
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:43,890
Get get it up, get get it up
Get get it up, get get it up

338
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,140
Like a loser, いつだって満たされないよ
Like a loser, I'm never satisfied

339
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,890
きっとその方が強いからさ
Surely that's why I'm stronger

340
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,890
迷宮なんてさ 出口も無いし 終わりのないさ
A labyrinth, there's no exit and no end

341
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,890
Oh Shit!!

342
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:02,890
此の中に溢れ出す 異常に価値のない有象無象
Overflowing inside here, extraordinarily worthless commoners

343
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,640
関係ない絆 あなたの心で
Irrelevant bonds, in your heart

349
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Everybody get it up! Come on!

350
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:49,890
Get get it up, get get it up
Get get it up, get get it up

351
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,390
一瞬の迷いも見せない 僕の独り舞台に落とすのは
Not showing a moment's hesitation, what I drop onto my solo stage is...

352
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:03,165
僕の喉が派手に渇くとするのは
If my throat were to become intensely parched,

353
00:30:03,665 --> 00:30:09,165
渇望と希望の二層を既に離した
I've already let go of the two layers of craving and hope.

354
00:30:09,665 --> 00:30:13,665
記憶だけ
Only memories.

Life has been seeking things worth protecting,

00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:23,165
いつか Oh Oh Oh Oh 越える
And one day, it will surpass them.

358
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:29,665
どなただっていいとかもう言わせないよ
I won't let anyone say "it can be just anyone" anymore.

359
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:32,665
Oh 響け Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh, resound!

360
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,165
全身全霊かけてやるさ
I'll give it my heart and soul.

361
00:30:35,665 --> 00:30:38,665
Get get it up! Get get it up!

362
00:30:38,665 --> 00:30:41,665
Get get it up! Get get it up!

363
00:30:57,665 --> 00:30:59,965

冤罪せんわそんな奴
I won't pardon a guy like that.

372
00:31:47,165 --> 00:31:52,165
あーもう情状酌量の余地なし即死刑ハイ
Ah, there's no room for leniency, death penalty right now, go!

373
00:31:52,665 --> 00:31:55,165

今すぐにお逝きなさい
Die right now!

375
00:32:03,165 --> 00:32:06,165
メラメラ Burning all day 真夏の楽園
Flaming hot, burning all day, a midsummer paradise.

376
00:32:06,665 --> 00:32:09,665
メラメラ 焼かれて 灰になるまで
Flaming hot, scorched until you turn to ash.

377
00:32:10,165 --> 00:32:13,665
メラメラ 虜にさせて さあ踊り狂っちゃって
Flaming hot, I'll captivate you, now dance like crazy!

378
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:17,665
火炙りパラダイス Go up and down
Burning at the stake paradise, go up and down.

379
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:21,665
Silly bakka silly b- Serious na shit, lemme shake it up.

380
00:32:21,665 --> 00:32:25,165
Do what I want shit you know what I got. Might be the pinnacle of cynical but first keep the mic high.

381
00:32:26,165 --> 00:32:29,165
And may I just remind you act a fool this god'll find you.

382

They wanna get real close, can't learn to let go.

385
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,965
Flame and dance with the R.I.P. set a look up below.

386
00:32:41,165 --> 00:32:44,665
Slay to the beat in the street rather than roast and slam 'em back 'til the sunrise and have a low slow.

387
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:47,965
Sleepin' to the next night you know where we go. Only fast folks keep the pace- Shinigami flow alright?

388
00:32:48,165 --> 00:32:49,165
Shinigami flow alright?

ほらまだまだ足りない
See, it's still not enough.

00:33:06,165 --> 00:33:09,165
Spent all day beneath the sun sun sun sun sun

愛は痛い苦しい苦しい
Love is painful, it hurts, it hurts.

396
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:27,665
灼熱に飛び込んで Give it to ya, give it to ya
Dive into the scorching heat, give it to ya, give it to ya.

397
00:33:31,165 --> 00:33:33,665
みなさん！ You got the rest!
Everyone! You got the rest!

398
00:33:33,665 --> 00:33:37,165
Mori and Kobo's in the building, so you know you're already dead.

399
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:39,165
You're dead!

火炙りパラダイス Go up and down
Burning at the stake paradise, go up and down.

403
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:29,665
Boko-boko-boko-boko-boko-boko Kobo!

404
00:34:29,665 --> 00:34:30,665
Woohoo!

405
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:33,165
Kobo, thank you so much for singing with me!

406
00:34:33,165 --> 00:34:35,665
Yo! Whoa! Ah!

407
00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:38,165
Thank you as well!

408
00:34:38,165 --> 00:34:41,665
Kobo wish you a happy birthday, best birthday!

409
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:43,665
Yeah, you know, you spit some flames.

410
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,665
You're a great rapper actually, Kobo, you should do more rap I think!

411
00:34:46,665 --> 00:34:48,665
Hey! It was so difficult, but...

412
00:34:48,665 --> 00:34:52,165
Kobo is a pro rapper and, yeah, you know...

413
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:54,665
We are a one blood right? Yeah, daddy?

414
00:34:55,165 --> 00:34:58,665
Yeah! Singing together with you was awesome!

415
00:34:58,665 --> 00:35:00,165
High five!

416
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,390
Kana, you nailed it! That was great, wow.

417
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,190
わあ、すごい、素敵な後輩。
Wow, incredible, what a wonderful junior.

418
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,190
You're amazing, wow.

419
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:09,690
Maybe following in Mori's footsteps a little bit? I don't know.

420
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,190
Release the Kobo Mixtape!

421
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,690

You kids these days with your... your always taking photos...

...and your hashtags...

429
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,690
Speaking of hashtags, take a screenshot of us...

430
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,690
...and then make sure that you use the hashtag...

431
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:38,690
...it's the one time where I won't feel embarrassed...

432
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,190
...if you spam my hashtag on Twitter/X, so please do it!

433
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,690
Strike a pose! Cheese!

Yeah! Get fancy with it!

435
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:49,190
Blue and pink is the best combination!

436
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,690
What do you think? I think we look pretty good together.

437
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,190
Okay, looks good, right? Uh...

Thanks again, Daddy, for inviting me!

445
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:21,190
Kobo wants to go to the mall with Mommy, okay? Bye-bye!

446
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:24,190
やった! See you later, Kobo! Bye-bye! Thanks again!
Score! See you later, Kobo! Bye-bye! Thanks again!

447
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,690
Wait, no down... no downtime, no downtime, no downtime! Hold on...

448
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,190
Okay, no downtime!

449
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,690
We keep it moving! We keep it moving onto the next!

450
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,690
I'm gonna die...

451
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,190
努力 未来 A BEAUTIFUL STAR
Effort, future, A BEAUTIFUL STAR

452

努力 未来 A BEAUTIFUL STAR
Effort, future, A BEAUTIFUL STAR

455
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,690
ランドリー 今日はガラ空きでラッキーデイ
The laundry is empty today, a lucky day

456
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,690
かったりぃ 油汚れもこれでバイバイ
So boring, say bye-bye to oil stains with this

457
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,190
誰だ 誰だ 頭の中 呼びかける声は
Who is it? Who is it? The voice calling in my head

458
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:18,690
あれが欲しい これが欲しい と歌っている
Singing, "I want that, I want this"

459
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,690
幸せになりたい 楽して生きていたい
I want to be happy, I want to live an easy life

460
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,690
この手に掴みたい あなたのその胸の中
I want to grab hold of it inside your chest

461
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,690
胸の中
Inside your chest

462
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,690
ハッピーで埋め尽くして

465
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,190
愛をばら撒いて
Scattering love all around

00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:48,190
あなたのその胸の中
Inside that chest of yours

483
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:55,190
胸の中
Inside your chest

512
00:40:36,815 --> 00:40:39,715
欠点です 現状把握そこから中断中
It's a flaw; understanding the current situation, suspended from there

513
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:43,215
もう譲渡 見せびらかし合いましょ
Already a transfer; let's show off to each other

514
00:40:43,365 --> 00:40:45,565

実のところ恵まれても虚無感が友だち
To be honest, even if blessed, a sense of emptiness is my friend

531
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,465

誰にも迷惑かけたくはないと思うが
I don't want to trouble anyone, but...

548
00:42:50,565 --> 00:42:53,565
迷惑をかけたくなければ
If you don't want to cause trouble

549
00:42:54,365 --> 00:42:57,465

Sessions for wounds, peaks for a healthy body, it feels good

563
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:03,715
Yay! Thank you so much everybody! That was Zanki, Time Left.

564
00:44:04,015 --> 00:44:08,515
Speaking of time left, there is none. There's no time left!

565
00:44:08,715 --> 00:44:15,015
But, uh, this has been a really, really amazing "No Down Time" live show with you guys and all of the amazing guests that came here.

566
00:44:15,215 --> 00:44:19,515
So thank you so much for coming to support me and have a great live show. My fourth one. Wow, my fourth...

567
00:44:19,715 --> 00:44:26,515
...my fourth birthday here in Holo, and I'm so, so happy to have gotten this chance to celebrate it with you here in the Underworld.

568
00:44:26,715 --> 00:44:34,015
It was fantastic. But, you know, it is my birthday, and when it comes to birthdays, there's... there's something important to announce.

569
00:44:34,215 --> 00:44:39,015
What does everybody announce during their birthday? Uh... hold on, I'm thinking.

570
00:44:39,215 --> 00:44:42,515
I don't know. I forgot. I forgot.

571
00:44:42,715 --> 00:44:45,315
Wait, it's... I remember, I remember! I remember!

572
00:44:45,515 --> 00:44:49,515
Rebeats, I'm a little scatterbrained, I'm sorry. It's because I'm excited.

573
00:44:49,715 --> 00:44:51,715
Birthday goods! Ta-da!

This, this is definitely a set that I'm...

577
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:05,390
...super excited to introduce to you guys.

578
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,690
By the way, check it out, me playing the bass.

579
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:09,390
Hey, it's not a lie...

580
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:12,090
...because for my birthday, I bought myself a bass!

581
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:14,490
Yay! I'm going to start learning again.

582
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,440
I'm not a fake bass player.

583
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,490
Stop! Don't call me that. I'm not a fake bass player.

584
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:20,090
ボコボコにするぞ。
I'll beat you up.

585
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,290
...okay?

586
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:23,240
It's cool. The illustration's cool and...

587
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,790
...and it's on a couple of these goods.

588
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,390
紹介しますね。
I guess I'll introduce them to you.

589
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:28,090
Next.

590
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,940
So, um, first of all, first and foremost...

591
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,240
Eternal Rest Square Cushion!

592
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,790
Would you like to sleep forever, Dead Beats?

593
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:39,340
Well, good news for you. I have a cushion that is...

594
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,490
...extremely comfy and super special...

595
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,940
...and has a picture of me playing the bass on it.

596
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,540
You're going to fall asleep immediately...

597
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,290
...but I can't guarantee that because of legal stuff.

598
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,790
Um, check it out. The art is beautiful.

599
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,890
Um, it's high quality and amazing.

600
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:56,490
Um, I think it's high quality.

601
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,590
I hope that you enjoy it.

602
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,590
Um, and you can take lots of naps with it.

603
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,540
I wish I could take naps. I can't take naps.

604
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,290
Next!

605
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:06,340
Next slide is... Hey, Dead Beats!

606
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,890
Do you guys like fashion? I like fashion.

607
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:13,840
There are designer brands I can't name because legal.

608
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,640
However, in the underworld, we have our own brands.

609
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,290
I have collaborated with one of my favorites...

610
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:25,790
...to create this Underworldian Designer Muffler!

611
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:31,240
I consider this like the 'Rizz Pack' birthday goods.

612
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,240
Check it out. Calliope Mori symbol.

613
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,590
Um, you can find other Dead Beats out in the wild...

614
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:41,090
...without just having Mori on your shirt, you know?

615
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,440
It's very convenient. And the tag is also super cute.

616
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,540
So make sure you get snug for fall and winter.

617
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,390
I hope you guys enjoy wearing this...

618
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,890
...and adding it to your wardrobe.

619
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,190
Next slide, please!

620
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:57,340
Additionally, we have... Dead Beat Honorary Ring!

621
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:02,390
Do not get it twisted, this is not a marriage ring.

622
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:04,190
結婚してないよ！
I'm not marrying you!

623
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,890
Dead Beats, I'm not going to marry you.

624
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,390
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too busy. I'm too busy.

625
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:12,990
But if you'd like, you could go ahead...

626
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:16,340
...and purchase this Dead Beat Honorary Ring...

627
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:21,140
...so that you can find other Dead Beats in the wild.

628
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,740
It makes it a little bit easier, right?

629
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,640
And plus, if it doesn't fit on your finger...

630
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,690
...you can go ahead and put it on a necklace.

631
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:31,140
And it's still very, very fashionable.

632
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,190
I really love the design. It reminds me of you guys.

633
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:37,990
I hope you'll enjoy wearing this very special ring.

634
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:38,890
And next!

635
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,040
Last, we have the "Your Last Shot"...

636
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,440
...shot glass set. Go find a Dead Beat and cheers!

637
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,590
Drink some alcohol that reminds you of Mori.

638
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,340
But they're very cute. It's a cute set.

639
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,540
I want to see them at every birthday party.

640
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,590
Every Dead Beat party in general.

641
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:03,240
Use these a lot to go wild and party. No downtime!

642
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,390
Um, I guess that's about it.

643
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:06,990
Next slide, please!

644
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:10,790
Um, we also have a situation voice.

645
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:14,290
It's called "Backstage with Calliope".

646
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:18,240
I don't know what this sounds like yet.

647
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,290
But maybe if I see you after the show...

648
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:23,990
...I might remember it. I don't know.

649
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:27,690
Maybe because it's yet to happen.

650
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:32,690
Also, if you get the full set, you get a special...

651
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:35,540
...secret voice. Please look forward to that.

652
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,790
And next slide!

653
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:40,640
For the entire full set, if you buy the whole thing...

654
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,190
...you will get a signed card by me!

655
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:47,540
Mori Calliope. And I'm signing all of them.

656
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:51,590
I'm signing every single card because you're great.

657
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:55,940
I want everybody to get a chance to get my signature.

658
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:59,290
I've been making it really easy for you guys recently.

659
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:02,740
But this one I definitely will be signing just for you.

660
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:12,990
You will get a hand-signed postcard from me.

661
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,590
Um, so yeah, please look forward to it.

662
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:16,390
And next slide, please!

663
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,690
Here's the full set and everything you get with it.

664
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:23,190
The cart will open as soon as the stream is over.

665
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:26,090
So make sure that you check it out.

666
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:28,090
You don't need to be fast because I'm signing all.

667
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,590
But make sure that you grab yours today! Woo!

668
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:32,890
So that is the... that's the merch situation.

669
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:35,140
Those are my birthday goods. I'm very happy with them.

670
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:41,290
I can't wait to receive mine, I hope you're excited.

671
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:44,440

713
00:51:54,265 --> 00:51:57,765
So, I have been chosen to sing the ending theme

714
00:51:58,065 --> 00:52:00,765
for the TV anime, Suicide Squad Isekai,

715
00:52:00,865 --> 00:52:03,765
to air from July.

716
00:52:04,765 --> 00:52:08,765
I'm so excited about this. I waited so long to tell you guys about it.

717
00:52:09,265 --> 00:52:11,765
And I know I already did tell you about it,

718
00:52:11,865 --> 00:52:14,265
but even saying it now, it feels like a dream.

719
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:19,765
I mean, even when I joined Holo, I said in my debut

720
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:24,265
one of my goals was to make a song for anime.

721
00:52:24,765 --> 00:52:28,265
But really, it's been my lifelong goal to do something like that.

722
00:52:28,765 --> 00:52:32,265
And I've already cried a lot over this, so I'm not going to here,

723
00:52:32,465 --> 00:52:37,265
but I'm very emotional about it. So please look forward to it.

724
00:52:37,765 --> 00:52:42,265
The animation production is by the amazing WIT STUDIO,

725
00:52:42,765 --> 00:52:46,265
so you know it's gonna be a banger. It's incredible.

726
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:51,265
And I really want everybody to watch it when it comes out.

727
00:52:51,765 --> 00:52:56,265
So please make sure that you stay tuned when it does air.

728
00:52:56,765 --> 00:52:58,765
And there's still something else I'd like to show you.

729
00:53:01,065 --> 00:53:02,765
2024.04.25

730
00:53:03,265 --> 00:53:05,765

COMING SOON

733
00:53:19,265 --> 00:53:22,765
Whoa! What was that? What was that?

734
00:53:23,265 --> 00:53:26,265
New song? But what kind of new song? I don't know.

735
00:53:26,765 --> 00:53:29,765
Is there... are there any guesses in the chat? What could this be?

736
00:53:30,265 --> 00:53:33,265
Well, we don't really have a lot of details about it yet.

737
00:53:33,765 --> 00:53:37,265
But it's a secret for another time. So please

738
00:53:37,765 --> 00:53:41,265
keep your eyes peeled for the big reveal coming sometime soon, I'm sure.

739
00:53:41,765 --> 00:53:43,765
Look forward to it.

740
00:53:44,265 --> 00:53:47,265
Now, that's it for the announcements.

741
00:53:47,765 --> 00:53:51,265
However, there is still one song left.

742
00:53:51,765 --> 00:53:55,765
That's right, because this train doesn't stop moving. No down time, baby.

743
00:53:56,265 --> 00:53:59,265
I'm starting to feel it, but perfect timing.

744
00:53:59,765 --> 00:54:02,265
I'm going to change clothes.

745
00:54:02,765 --> 00:54:04,765
So don't watch me, どダメ！ Look over there!
So don't watch me, absolutely no! Look over there!

746
00:54:05,265 --> 00:54:07,765
Please don't watch a lady change... Whoa! That was fast.

747
00:54:08,265 --> 00:54:11,265
Callie's very fast. Check it.

748
00:54:11,765 --> 00:54:15,265
It's my Wrapper Reaper T-shirts. I have a bunch of different designs.

749
00:54:15,765 --> 00:54:19,265
You can choose your color and stuff like that. They're on the Mori store.

750
00:54:19,765 --> 00:54:22,265
Make sure that you grab yours if you haven't already. It's very neat.

751
00:54:22,765 --> 00:54:26,265
Check it out. I'm very, very proud of this one.

752
00:54:26,765 --> 00:54:30,265
This one in particular I drew myself, so it's very special to me.

753
00:54:31,265 --> 00:54:34,265
Now let's do this last song, you guys.

754
00:54:34,765 --> 00:54:38,265
A song that I've wanted to perform since my early days in HoloEN.

755
00:54:38,765 --> 00:54:42,265
I think you guys will understand why it's so special when you see it.

756
00:54:43,265 --> 00:54:45,265
Everybody, thank you for coming. Let's rock!

757
00:54:45,765 --> 00:54:47,265

Listen well guys and gals, my important talent,

771
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:25,290
You can't dance around it,
they'll just tie you down.

772
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:26,790
Boys mayhem!

773
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:27,790
That's right!

774
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:28,790
Like a soulman.

775
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:32,290
Hey you with the bangs and the attitude,
who's the one that's about to go whack-a-bow

776
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,290
Down to!

777
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,790
Down to!

778
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:39,290
Down to!

779
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:41,290
Down to!

780
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:44,490
Don't you get it twisted,
you're the one taking control!

781
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:46,290
Rocking, rocking out, rapping, rocking roll,

782
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:48,790
Strumming that guitar to the rhythm
that just won't stop,

783
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:51,290
Don't stop, let me see you let it out,
rest in peace to any doubt,

784
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:57,290
You keep rocking, rocking out,
rapping, rocking roll!

785
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:59,290
Alright so hold up, what's the plan?

786
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,890
Ready first string, banger like "no I can't"!

787
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,790
In the worst case hang around,
sing shit underground, gotta rep not a crown, so what?

788
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:06,790
Got something to say, you better say it loud,
you got a whack ass sound a little more profound,

789
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,790
As it on and on it goes, on and on and on,
off with the opinions, not by a long shot,

790
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:12,590
When you're hot gotta take the heat, till then it burn
you both because the street's command,

791
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:16,790
To stay tough with the make-up, glamour style,
you can fake it for a gangster a little while.

792
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,790
Boys mayhem, like a soul man!

793
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:22,790
You can't be stopped, seeing break-all-real-fast,
make it last!

794
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:24,290
Better take a selfie!

795
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:26,090
Selfie!

796
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,290
Selfie!

797
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:33,290
Selfie!

798
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,290
You ain't gonna die on me,
we gotta stay alive!

799
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:38,790
Rocking, rocking out, rapping, rocking roll,

800
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:40,790
Even songs of love bring emotion
that just won't stop,

801
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:42,790
Don't stop, she's the flow and my beloved,
she's her world and light it up,

802
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:48,790
By rocking, rocking out, rapping, rocking roll!

803
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:49,890
Down!

804
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:52,790
Give it up for Hololive English Myth Band!

805
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:55,790
Takanashi Kiara on keyboard!

806
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,490
Ninomae Ina'nis on drums!

807
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:00,290
Ukulele-go Gura!

808
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:02,090
Amelia Watson, guitar!

809
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,290
Mori, bass!

810
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:05,790
So we don't half-ass this, playing to the masses,
marking your ahead is in, now we've passed this,

811
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:08,790
A-yo, where the pros met us in,
gimme-gimme that compression and apprehension,

812
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:11,790
Keep stressing the present, leaving 'em guessing,
under the weather, disbelief suspension,

813
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:14,790
Big sorry guys, if I apologize,
take us to hell, can you tell that my voice is just about to die?

814
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:17,790
Huh?

815
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:19,290
Huh?

816
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:21,290
Huh?

817
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:22,790
Huh?

818
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:27,790
I didn't think you could still perform,
but if you guys want to, I don't know...

819
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:30,290
Better know, get a grip, cut that shit baby!

820
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:31,790
Baby!

821
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:33,490
Baby!

822
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,090
Baby!

823
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:36,790
Baby!

824
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,290
Baby!

825
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:42,790
You ain't gonna die on me,
we gotta stay alive!

826
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:46,290
Rocking, rocking out, rapping, rocking roll,
strumming that guitar to the rhythm that just won't stop,

827
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:49,290
Don't stop, let me see you let it out,
rest in peace to any doubt,

828
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:55,490
You keep rocking, rocking out,
rapping, rocking roll!

829
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:58,490
Rocking, rocking out!

830
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:01,090
Rapping, rocking roll!

831
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:05,790
La la la-la-la-la-la...

832
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:07,790
Proving I won't die!

833
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:09,090
You ain't dying either!

834
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,790
Music, rap and fire!

835
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:14,290
It's how we stay alive!

836
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:18,790
Hell yeah!

837
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:19,790
Alright!

838
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:21,290
Thank you everyone!

839
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:22,790
Myth fucking rocks!

840
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,790
Rap and rap and rock and roll!
