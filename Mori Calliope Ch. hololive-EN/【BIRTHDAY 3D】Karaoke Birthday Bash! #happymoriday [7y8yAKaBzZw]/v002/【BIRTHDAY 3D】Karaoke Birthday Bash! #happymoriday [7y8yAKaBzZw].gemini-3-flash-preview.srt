I'm a reaper, soul-taker, hell-raiser

I'm a non-believer, non-achiever, soul-bleeder

愛されたい　ただそれだけなのに
I just want to be loved, and yet...

不器用な自分に　苛立つよ
I get frustrated with my own clumsiness

49
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,150
夢を追いかける　背中を追いかけて

あ、すごい。
Ah, amazing.

104
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,196
でも何か元気すぎるからちょっと...
But I'm a bit too energetic, so...

105
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:18,196
すぐにヘトヘトになっちゃうから...
I'll get exhausted right away...

106
00:10:18,796 --> 00:10:20,296
ちょっと落ち着きます。
I'll calm down a bit.

107

誰もが皆知ってる
Everyone knows it

110
00:15:15,677 --> 00:15:20,777
消せやしない傷を
The scars that won't fade

111
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:24,377
どれくらい続くの?
How long will it last?

112
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:31,477

I don't need it anymore

113
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:35,577

Everyone is waiting

114
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:40,477

戦場の兵士たち
Soldiers on the battlefield

116
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:47,677
思い出してよ
Remember

117
00:15:47,677 --> 00:15:55,977
今母の温もりを
A mother's warmth now

118
00:15:57,077 --> 00:16:02,677
この果てしなく広い世界に
In this endlessly wide world

119
00:16:02,677 --> 00:16:06,477
自分だけの地図描いて
Drawing a map of your own

120
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:11,677
涙こらえて僕らは
Holding back tears, we

121
00:16:11,677 --> 00:16:16,877
歩いてゆこう
Will walk on

122
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:22,377
立ち上がれ今ほら何度でも
Rise up now, as many times as it takes

123
00:16:22,377 --> 00:16:27,877
眠れる獅子呼び起こして
Wake the sleeping lion

124
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:34,577
生きてゆくんだ
We'll live on

125
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:38,777

誰もが皆待ってる
Everyone is waiting

127
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:58,477
ひと欠片の愛を
For a tiny piece of love

128
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:01,977
憎んでも
Even if you hate

129
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:07,677
何ひとつ生まれないんだよ
Nothing will ever be born

130
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:12,577
そんなのも思い出してよ
Remember that too

131
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:22,477
この限りある時間の中で
In this limited time

132
00:17:22,477 --> 00:17:32,177
まだ見ぬ楽園目指して
Aiming for a paradise yet unseen

133
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:42,077
どこまでだって僕らは歩いてゆこう
We'll walk as far as it takes

134
00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:52,677
振り向かないで前だけを見て
Don't look back, just look forward

135
00:17:52,677 --> 00:18:01,177
その身体朽ち果てるまで
Until that body decays

136
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:07,377
生きてゆくんだ
We'll live on

137
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,877
未来へ
Toward the future

138
00:18:11,677 --> 00:18:14,177
Dako-chan, dance!

139
00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:20,177

So cute! Nice!

141
00:18:33,777 --> 00:18:37,877
思い出してよ
Remember

142
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:42,877
今母の温もりを
A mother's warmth now

143
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:49,677
この果てしなく広い世界の
In this endlessly wide world

144
00:18:49,677 --> 00:18:53,877
まだ見ぬ楽園目指して
Aiming for a paradise yet unseen

145
00:18:53,877 --> 00:19:03,877
どこまでだって僕らは歩いてゆこう
We'll walk as far as it takes

146
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:14,077
振り向かないで前だけを見て
Don't look back, just look forward

147
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:19,877
生きてゆくんだ
We'll live on

148
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:23,877
未来へ
Toward the future

149
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:34,177
Thank you.

150
00:19:34,777 --> 00:19:35,877
Kawaii!

151
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:37,877
All right, let's do...

152

Well, today, I wanted to sing a very low song,

289
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:44,060

And I wondered who in Hololive could sing with a low voice,

290
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:49,060
あのルイちゃん、確かにルイちゃん。
And Lui-chan, definitely Lui-chan.

Among the JP members, her voice is the lowest.

293

That's right. Yeah, yeah...

294
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,060
I decided to ask Lui to come sing with me...

295
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,060
...because I wanted to sing a really low song.

296
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,060
And she has the lowest voice I know in Hololive...

297
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,060
...aside from Towa-senpai who I'll have to do next time.

298
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
But I love Lui's voice.

299

467
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:33,929
If you get the whole set, a limited number

468
00:37:33,929 --> 00:37:36,429
of Deadbeats will get a hand-signed postcard!

469
00:37:36,429 --> 00:37:39,929
They're gonna sell out fast because I really like

470
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:42,929
my hand! But never fear, if you buy the full set,

471
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:45,929
you get a duplicated autograph postcard!

472
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:48,929
Remember Deadbeats, shop until you're dead...

473
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:52,429
beats! Get it? Deadbeats? Like the name

474
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:55,929
of the fans! Ha ha ha!

475
00:37:56,429 --> 00:37:58,929
Yo, shut the fuck up, no one's laughing at that shit.

476
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:00,429
Wait Mori, no, I'm sorry!

477
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:01,929
Mori, I'm sorry, no! Mori, no!

478
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:03,929
Please, stop that shit, stop that shit out! No!

479
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:07,429
Mori, please, take it down! Oh god!

480
00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:10,929
Oh! It hurts! I feel faint...

481
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:18,929
Don't worry about the ending part, that was just a little bit.

482
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:21,929
It wasn't real, it wasn't real.

483
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:25,429
Anyway, anyway! What about it, you guys?

484
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:27,929
What do you think of the merch?

485
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:31,429
Pretty cool, right? Pretty cool. Love some good violence...

486
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:34,429
no, no violence here. No, no, no, no.

487
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:37,429
Well, I hope you guys will be excited about this

488
00:38:37,429 --> 00:38:40,429
and enjoy the many wonderful... bath bombs! Woah!

489
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:44,429
Crazy! Plush of my own... I hope you guys will get it.

490
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:47,929
Yeah, it'll be really cool. I swear you'll use

491
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:50,429
the things every day, you'll use the things every single day.

492
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:53,929
And... it's not that bad of a price? I don't know

493
00:38:53,929 --> 00:38:56,929
your financial situation, so be careful.

494
00:38:57,429 --> 00:38:59,929
Additionally, additionally, additionally...

495
00:39:00,429 --> 00:39:03,429
um, there's something else I wanted to talk about.

496
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:06,929
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I've already talked about this before

497
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:09,429
but I'm going to talk about it again because

498
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:11,929
I need more time to rest and also just because

499
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:14,929
it's really important to me that you get it.

500
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:17,929
Because if you buy this, my dreams will come true.

501
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:20,929
So, what else do we have here? I'm going to show it

502
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:23,429
to you again, it's the Blu-ray! P-chow! P-chow!

503
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:27,929
みなさん！
Everyone!

504
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:31,429
WHAT'S UP!!!!

505
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:35,929

00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:46,429
LIVE Blu-ray Release!!!

508
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:52,429
NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER - JULY 21, 2022 - TOYOSU PIT

509
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:55,429
Yeah! Blu-ray, Blu-ray!

510
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:58,429
And if you get it, you get lots of nice things too.

511
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,262
Or I mean that... look, it's behind me.

512
00:40:00,104 --> 00:40:01,504
Right here, look.

513
00:40:01,504 --> 00:40:03,804
Look at all the nice things you get depending on the store you buy it from.

514
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:06,604
There are like all kinds of different little things that you can get.

515
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:10,604
In addition, the only way to get them all is to buy the Blu-ray many many times, I don't know.

516
00:40:10,604 --> 00:40:12,804
If you'd like to, you certainly can.

517
00:40:12,804 --> 00:40:16,904
Because like I said, if you buy this Blu-ray, all my dreams come true.

518
00:40:16,904 --> 00:40:19,904
Yay Mori store, yay Mori store, yay!

519
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:22,504
Um, yeah, it would make me really, really happy...

520
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:26,604
...because I'm super proud of this, of this release.

521
00:40:26,604 --> 00:40:28,504
So yeah, check out the Blu-ray.

522
00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:31,604
And don't go anywhere, because I still have one big announcement...

523
00:40:31,604 --> 00:40:35,104
...or a couple of announcements, but one really big announcement at the end of the stream.

524
00:40:35,104 --> 00:40:37,404
So don't go anywhere, okay?

525
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:39,104
We still got more to do.

526
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,604
But yeah, buy the Blu-ray, it would make me really happy.

527
00:40:41,604 --> 00:40:43,104
Yeah, that'd be really great.

528
00:40:43,104 --> 00:40:45,104
Another really big show might happen someday.

529
00:40:45,104 --> 00:40:48,104
Well, I guess the surprise is kind of ruined, but just kidding, here it is.

530
00:40:48,104 --> 00:40:51,104
Yatta—!
We did it—!

531
00:40:51,104 --> 00:40:54,104
大丈夫、you didn't see anything. You didn't see anything.
It's okay, you didn't see anything. You didn't see anything.

532
00:40:54,104 --> 00:40:55,804
You didn't see anything. You saw nothing.

533
00:40:55,804 --> 00:40:58,604
Oh god, da... No, don't look there. Don't look there.

534
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:03,904
No, no, no, no, it's fine. You pretend like you didn't, pretend like you didn't see anything.

535
00:41:03,904 --> 00:41:06,604
There's still another, there's still another announcement, okay?

536
00:41:07,604 --> 00:41:09,604
Just pretend like you didn't see.

537
00:41:09,604 --> 00:41:11,104
I don't know what you're talking about.

538
00:41:11,104 --> 00:41:13,304
Hey, I think someone's here. Oh my gosh.

539
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,904
What is this? Perhaps the sound of a phone that's about to ring?

540
00:41:15,904 --> 00:41:20,104
あ、電話、電話かな。電話ありますね。
Oh, a phone, I wonder if it's a phone? We have a phone here.

541
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:21,904
ほら見て、we have a phone over here.
Look, we have a phone over here.

542
00:41:21,904 --> 00:41:24,104
Isn't that great?

543
00:41:24,104 --> 00:41:26,604
It would be awesome if it were to ring at some point.

544
00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:32,604
Oh! It's ringing!

545
00:41:34,104 --> 00:41:35,104
Oh my gosh, no way!

546
00:41:35,104 --> 00:41:37,104
All right, let me see if I can grab it. Watch this.

547
00:41:40,104 --> 00:41:42,104
もしもし？
Hello?

548
00:41:42,104 --> 00:41:44,904
Hi, it's Calli. I heard you're lonely...

549
00:41:44,904 --> 00:41:48,404
...at a karaoke booth by yourself on your birthday. Is the phone okay?

550
00:41:48,404 --> 00:41:51,604
Yeah, no, I can hear you perfectly well. I... don't worry about it, it's fine, it's fine.

551
00:41:51,604 --> 00:41:54,604
Hold on, let me hold on, let me just T-pose real quick.

552
00:42:08,604 --> 00:42:10,104
大丈夫かな？
I wonder if it's okay?

553
00:42:10,104 --> 00:42:13,504
Okay, let's see. Oh hello, okay, sorry, I can hear you perfectly now, IRyS. Hey, what's going on?

554
00:42:13,504 --> 00:42:15,604
Hi, Calli! Hey!

555
00:42:15,604 --> 00:42:19,504
I heard you were lonely and I was wondering if you wanted a visit from a certain Nephilim or so.

556
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:21,104
I'm not lonely, I...

557
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:23,604
But wait, no, no, no, you don't want me to come?

558
00:42:23,604 --> 00:42:26,104
No, please, come! I don't have to come, you know.

559
00:42:26,104 --> 00:42:28,304
No, no, no, I want to sing with you. IRyS, please, come here.

560
00:42:28,304 --> 00:42:30,904
Yeah, let's karaoke party! I'll run there right now. I'll teleport there, yeah.

561
00:42:30,904 --> 00:42:32,504
Are you sure you can run?

562
00:42:32,504 --> 00:42:34,104
You have legs to run with?

563
00:42:34,104 --> 00:42:38,304
Uh... it'll be something. I'm sure I might go too fast, I might... I might lose some dimension on my body.

564
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:44,904
Okay, well, good luck. I'm just going to go ahead and put the phone away then.

565
00:42:44,904 --> 00:42:47,404
All right! I'm hanging up now. Bye!

566
00:42:50,104 --> 00:42:52,604
There it goes, I put the phone away. Hi!

567
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:55,604
Okay, looks like IRyS is going to come and join us. We're going to maybe sing together.

568
00:42:55,604 --> 00:42:57,504
Does that sound cool?

569
00:42:57,504 --> 00:43:00,104
All right, well let's wait and see when she's going to be here. Me and Gaikotsu-kun are waiting.

570
00:43:02,604 --> 00:43:04,104
Calli—!

571
00:43:04,604 --> 00:43:07,104
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh my god, what happened to you?

572
00:43:07,104 --> 00:43:08,604
Why are you flat?

573
00:43:08,604 --> 00:43:13,104
Oh, no, I just... I came too fast, I couldn't process my whole body into... into the room.

574
00:43:14,104 --> 00:43:16,604
Stop... Oh my god.

575
00:43:17,104 --> 00:43:20,104
Wait, what's wrong? Do I look different? Do I look different from usual?

576
00:43:20,104 --> 00:43:21,104
As beautiful as usual, right?

577
00:43:21,104 --> 00:43:24,104
Well, yeah, of course, naturally. I mean, you're always very pretty.

578
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:27,604
But you are, you are definitely flat.

579
00:43:27,604 --> 00:43:32,104
I think that's okay, because it just means more people can get excited for your official 3D debut, right?

580
00:43:32,104 --> 00:43:35,104
Yes! It's Flat-RyS! It's Flat-RyS!

581
00:43:37,104 --> 00:43:41,604
Wow, I mean, hey, you know what? As long as you can still sing, I'm happy to have you here.

582
00:43:41,604 --> 00:43:43,104
I am happy too!

583
00:43:43,104 --> 00:43:47,104
And you know one thing that's good about being flat? What?

584
00:43:47,104 --> 00:43:52,104
Is that, you know, since I'm basically just a piece of cardboard, I can touch Calli, I can do no matter what I'm doing to her right now...

585
00:43:52,104 --> 00:43:54,104
Hold on... Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

586
00:43:54,104 --> 00:43:58,604
But you can't tell because it's not full body tracking!

587
00:43:58,604 --> 00:44:02,104
No, no, no, stop that. Stop, stop, stop! Why are you being weird?

588
00:44:02,104 --> 00:44:05,604
Stop, you're like a... you're like a fly.

589
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:08,604
I'm going to swat you... Stop doing that!

590
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,604
No, no, no. 意地悪！
No, no, no. How mean!

591
00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:12,604
こいつ！
This girl!

592
00:44:13,604 --> 00:44:17,104
All right, well, it's fine, it's fine. You know what? I'll allow, I'll allow your little...

593
00:44:17,104 --> 00:44:20,104
...your little shenanigans as long as we can sing together.

594
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:21,104
Yay! Are we going to sing?

595
00:44:21,604 --> 00:44:22,604
Of course!

596
00:44:23,104 --> 00:44:26,604
I was thinking maybe we should sing a song from an anime that we both have seen...

597
00:44:26,604 --> 00:44:29,104
...and we both have talked about on the chat before.

598
00:44:29,104 --> 00:44:31,104
Yes! That anime.

599
00:44:31,104 --> 00:44:33,604
That anime with the... with the bad ending.

600
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:38,604
Oh, that anime itself was... was a good anime, but man, the ship...

601
00:44:41,604 --> 00:44:44,104
Best girl lost, and so I'll never forgive that anime. But that's okay.

602
00:44:44,104 --> 00:44:46,604
She was robbed. She was robbed.

603
00:44:46,604 --> 00:44:50,104
We're going to sing, we're going to sing the opening of True Tears.

604
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,604
True Tears, yeah! It is the opening.

605
00:44:51,604 --> 00:44:54,104
It's the opening. Okay, it's the opening. We're going to sing...

606
00:44:54,104 --> 00:44:56,604
リフレクティア！
Reflectia!

607
00:44:56,604 --> 00:44:58,604
Reflectia!

608
00:45:00,104 --> 00:45:01,104
Let's do it. Yay!

609
00:45:13,937 --> 00:45:17,612
虹色の回路に
To the rainbow-colored circuit,

610
00:45:17,612 --> 00:45:23,412

countless words,

611
00:45:23,412 --> 00:45:27,612
半分だけでも ここならば
even if it's only half, if I'm here,

612
00:45:27,612 --> 00:45:31,512
進んで行ける
I can move forward.

613
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:35,612

A sudden melody

614
00:45:35,612 --> 00:45:39,412
また加速して行く

615
00:45:39,412 --> 00:45:43,612
心を掴んだ 一片の
Capturing my heart, a single fragment

616
00:45:43,612 --> 00:45:47,512

00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:51,412
まなざしキラキラ
A sparkling gaze,

618
00:45:51,412 --> 00:45:55,412
あまり大きくない
even a road that isn't

619
00:45:55,412 --> 00:46:02,312
道でもいいね
very big is fine.

620
00:46:02,312 --> 00:46:06,212
そして駆け出す 飛び込む 奇跡へ
Then I start running, jumping into a miracle,

621
00:46:06,212 --> 00:46:10,312
見上げる 手を振る 光へ
looking up, waving my hand toward the light.

622
00:46:10,312 --> 00:46:15,912
止まらない気持ちを つないで行く
I'll connect these unstoppable feelings.

奏でる 夢見る 未来へ

Happy Birthday!

791
00:56:44,981 --> 00:56:45,981
Thank you, Bae!

792
00:56:45,981 --> 00:56:46,981
Thank you, Bae!

793
00:56:46,981 --> 00:56:48,981
Thank you, Bae! I appreciate you.

794
00:56:48,981 --> 00:56:49,981
Hi!

795
00:56:49,981 --> 00:56:51,481
Oh my god, IRyS.

796
00:56:51,481 --> 00:56:52,481
Bae-bae!

797
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:53,981
Bae!

798
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:56,981
Bae-bae, how do you like me in this form, Bae?

799
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:59,981
Oh no! Oh no, I disappeared into the ground again!

800
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:01,481
It's okay, I'm uncovering you.

801
00:57:01,481 --> 00:57:02,981
Oh wait, I don't know...

802
00:57:02,981 --> 00:57:04,981
Look at her swim! She's swimming now.

803
00:57:04,981 --> 00:57:08,981
It's okay, no, I'm making the same pose that Kaworu-kun
made when he was floating with Shinji-kun.

804
00:57:08,981 --> 00:57:11,981
You can't be doing that! You can't say something
like that!

805
00:57:12,981 --> 00:57:14,981
Oh! Wait, I'm sorry.

806
00:57:14,981 --> 00:57:15,981
Bruh.

807
00:57:15,981 --> 00:57:16,981
Bruh.

808
00:57:16,981 --> 00:57:19,481
Anyway, Happy Birthday Calli!

809
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:21,481
Oh, thank you, Bae!

810
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:24,481
Hey, you know, when you do a ChadCast, it might be
something like this.

811
00:57:24,481 --> 00:57:25,481
Oh, there we go.

812
00:57:25,481 --> 00:57:26,981
I'm doing great.

813
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:29,481
Thank you for making some time to call.

814
00:57:29,481 --> 00:57:31,481
Of course! Anytime for you!

815
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:33,481
I was so excited! Yay!

816
00:57:33,481 --> 00:57:34,481
Yay! Bruh.

817
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:36,981
Bae, I have a question for you, Bae.

818
00:57:36,981 --> 00:57:37,981
A little birthday question.

819
00:57:37,981 --> 00:57:39,481
Yes!

820
00:57:39,481 --> 00:57:41,981
What do you want to see me do this year?

821
00:57:41,981 --> 00:57:43,981
It could be anything.

822
00:57:43,981 --> 00:57:46,481
What do I want to see you do this year?

823
00:57:46,481 --> 00:57:47,981
Oh, that's a good question.

824
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:48,981
Yeah.

825
00:57:48,981 --> 00:57:52,481
I want to see you... wait, is this like a promise
that you'll do it?

826
00:57:52,481 --> 00:57:54,481
Kind of.

827
00:57:54,481 --> 00:57:56,981
We'll see, that depends. Depends on some factors.

828
00:57:56,981 --> 00:57:58,481
I see. Um...

829
00:57:58,481 --> 00:58:01,481
As your sister, I actually would want to see you
take an actual break.

830
00:58:02,481 --> 00:58:04,481
Oh.

831
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,981
I was waiting for...

832
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:07,481
I was...

833
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:09,981
I would like to see you...

834
00:58:09,981 --> 00:58:11,981
that's what I would like to see, period.

835
00:58:12,481 --> 00:58:13,981
I appreciate that.

836
00:58:13,981 --> 00:58:15,981
Thank you. Hold on, I'm T-posing.

837
00:58:15,981 --> 00:58:17,981
Thank you.

838
00:58:17,981 --> 00:58:21,481
I thought it was going to be something cool like, oh
we should like maybe learn to breakdance or something.

839
00:58:21,481 --> 00:58:23,481
No, okay, look, you said...

840
00:58:23,481 --> 00:58:26,981
okay, that was my sisterly answer.

841
00:58:26,981 --> 00:58:28,981
Thank you.

842
00:58:28,981 --> 00:58:30,981
If... okay, something that I would want to
see you do this year...

843
00:58:30,981 --> 00:58:32,981
something cool.

844
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:35,481
Let's see. Um...

845
00:58:35,481 --> 00:58:39,481
If... okay, something that I would want to see you
do this year, something cool. Let's see.

846
00:58:39,481 --> 00:58:42,981
You know what I would actually want to see you
try and do a...

847
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:45,981
Oh! We should learn how to do a freeze together!

848
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,981
A freeze? What's that?

849
00:58:48,981 --> 00:58:50,481
It's a breakdancing move.

850
00:58:50,481 --> 00:58:53,981
It's when like you do like a breakdancing move
and then you freeze...

851
00:58:53,981 --> 00:58:57,481
...in like a position. Yeah!

852
00:58:57,481 --> 00:58:59,981
Oh, okay! Yeah, definitely! I mean, that sounds cool.

853
00:58:59,981 --> 00:59:03,981
Wait, so like, you mean like, super cool like Matrix
kind of thing?

854
00:59:03,981 --> 00:59:07,981
Like maybe like we swivel on our heads and then like
stop?

855
00:59:09,481 --> 00:59:11,481
Um...

856
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:12,981
Maybe?

857
00:59:12,981 --> 00:59:15,481
Yatta! Okay, the phone is fixed.
Hurray! Okay, the phone is fixed.

858
00:59:15,481 --> 00:59:16,981
Oh, okay.

859
00:59:16,981 --> 00:59:19,981
Okay, yeah. You said you wanted to freeze together?

860
00:59:19,981 --> 00:59:20,981
Yeah.

861
00:59:20,981 --> 00:59:22,981
What's a freeze?

862
00:59:22,981 --> 00:59:25,481
A freeze... a freeze is like when you like stop...

863
00:59:25,481 --> 00:59:29,481
it's like a pose but like you're suspending yourself
off the ground.

864
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:31,981
It's like a breakdancing pose. Yeah, something like that.

865
00:59:31,981 --> 00:59:34,981
That's kind of advanced, but there's things like a
baby freeze.

866
00:59:34,981 --> 00:59:36,981
I think that's the first thing beginner
breakdancers try and learn.

867
00:59:36,981 --> 00:59:37,981
Cool!

868
00:59:37,981 --> 00:59:38,981
Yeah, I'm down.

869
00:59:38,981 --> 00:59:41,981
Alright then, let's do it.

870
00:59:41,981 --> 00:59:45,981
I mean, if we ever do like a big ChadCast like live
performance or something, I want to try a
freeze with you.

871
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:46,981
Yeah.

872
00:59:46,981 --> 00:59:48,981
Oh... yeah, I don't know how to do...

873
00:59:48,981 --> 00:59:49,981
You don't know how to do it!?

874
00:59:49,981 --> 00:59:50,981
Wait, you don't know how to do it!?

875
00:59:51,481 --> 00:59:53,981
I don't... it's been a very long time...

876
00:59:53,981 --> 00:59:57,981
since my body's not like it used to be, okay!?

877
00:59:57,981 --> 00:59:58,981
Then how are we gonna learn!?

878
00:59:58,981 --> 00:59:59,981
Alright, alright.

879
00:59:59,981 --> 01:00:01,281
Well, I'll give you some time to learn and then...

880
01:00:00,156 --> 01:00:01,456
I'll learn as well, okay?

881
01:00:01,456 --> 01:00:01,956
Okay.

882
01:00:01,956 --> 01:00:06,956
Oh my god, that'd be so much fun. My heart stopped when I heard Rakuen earlier.

883
01:00:07,156 --> 01:00:10,656
Oh, see, I thought of you. I thought of you singing that song.

884
01:00:10,656 --> 01:00:13,656
Yeah, 'cause you know, we're all Inuyasha gang here, so...

885
01:00:13,656 --> 01:00:16,956
Yeah... Yeah, that... that makes me really happy.

886
01:00:16,956 --> 01:00:22,656
Well, speaking of songs that I'm doing, what would you...

887
01:00:22,656 --> 01:00:28,156
All right, I'm gonna give you the ability to ask me for like a dance move or pose request

888
01:00:28,156 --> 01:00:30,956
for the next songs that I'm gonna sing. You don't know which songs they are, but...

889
01:00:30,956 --> 01:00:33,556
but I'll insert it. Even if I'm singing a sad slow one, if you want me to do the worm, I'll do it.

890
01:00:33,556 --> 01:00:34,656
Don't choose that, by the way.

891
01:00:34,656 --> 01:00:38,356
All right. Um, do you perhaps know... Okay, there's a...

892
01:00:38,356 --> 01:00:41,356
Okay, I would like to see a pepper grinder move in there.

893
01:00:41,356 --> 01:00:42,656
What is that? What's that one?

894
01:00:42,656 --> 01:00:45,956
Okay, so put your two hands in front of you. Okay.

895
01:00:45,956 --> 01:00:49,156
One... and then pretend you're grinding pepper.

896
01:00:50,156 --> 01:00:53,156
Yeah! Pepper grinder!

897
01:00:53,156 --> 01:00:55,656
That's actually... That's pretty cool. Okay, I'll do that.

898
01:00:55,656 --> 01:00:57,656
All right, I'll do... I'll do your pepper grinder.

899
01:00:57,656 --> 01:01:01,156
Yeah! Do the pepper grinder! And I'd like to see a Holo squat for a song.

900
01:01:01,156 --> 01:01:06,156
Squat? Okay, yeah! Whatever you want, Bae! All right, sure, squat! I'll do it for you.

901
01:01:07,656 --> 01:01:10,656
All right, well I gotta... I gotta get going. You see these eyebags I've got under my eye?

902
01:01:10,656 --> 01:01:13,156
They're from you. But I love you very much.

903
01:01:14,156 --> 01:01:17,156
I love you too! Happy Birthday, Calli!

904
01:01:17,156 --> 01:01:21,156
Thank you for the birthday wishes! You're the best, Bae!

905
01:01:21,156 --> 01:01:23,156
You're the best! I'll talk to you later!

906
01:01:23,156 --> 01:01:25,656
Love you! Bye-bye! Bye, Bae!

907
01:01:25,656 --> 01:01:27,656
Bye, Bae! Bye, Bae! Why are you still there?

908
01:01:27,656 --> 01:01:31,156
Bye! I'm still here! Bye, Bae!

909
01:01:34,656 --> 01:01:39,656
There we go, that was... that was Bae. Bae gave me a call on my birthday. Wasn't that sweet? Wasn't it sweet, IRyS?

910
01:01:40,156 --> 01:01:45,156
Yeah! It was very sweet. Sorry, I'm... I'm probably either in the ground or invisible right now.

911
01:01:45,156 --> 01:01:50,156
It's okay. She's become a ghost, but she's still among us.

912
01:01:50,156 --> 01:01:52,656
Don't... Chat, never mind. All right, well I wonder if somebody else will call.

913
01:01:53,156 --> 01:01:55,656
ほ、他の誰か電話するかな？
I wonder if someone else will call?

914
01:01:56,156 --> 01:01:58,656
誰が電話するのかなー？
I wonder who's calling?

915
01:01:58,656 --> 01:02:04,656
Oh my gosh, someone's calling! Someone's calling! Someone's calling! All right, let's go pick up the phone again! Let's see what happens!

916
01:02:05,656 --> 01:02:07,156
I got it! Oh, it worked!

917
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:10,656
もしもし！ Kitty, Kitty, もしもし！
Hello! Kitty, Kitty, hello!

918
01:02:10,656 --> 01:02:13,156
It's Wawa! Kiara! Wawa's here!

919
01:02:14,656 --> 01:02:19,656
Hello! What's up? You've got like a super special themed karaoke room!

920
01:02:20,156 --> 01:02:23,156
I do! I wanted to do something special this year, you know?

921
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:27,656
Oh my god, what... eh? But it's like... normally you get these super boring karaoke rooms if you go to karaoke.

922
01:02:27,656 --> 01:02:32,156
You gotta pay extra for the special ones. So how much did you pay for this special one?

923
01:02:32,656 --> 01:02:37,156
You don't want to know, Kiara. You don't want to know how much I paid. But you know what? I'm happy.

924
01:02:37,156 --> 01:02:41,156
Twelve bits! Sometimes you gotta treat yourself to something nice!

925
01:02:41,656 --> 01:02:45,656
That's true, that's true. You know what, that's... that's the spice of life, honestly, that I get to do this kind of stuff.

926
01:02:45,656 --> 01:02:49,156
I'm really happy, I'm lucky, you know?

927
01:02:49,156 --> 01:02:51,656
Yay! Happy Birthday, Kewie!

928
01:02:51,656 --> 01:02:55,656
Thanks so much, Kiwawa! I appreciate you calling in to wish me a happy birthday.

929
01:02:55,656 --> 01:02:59,156
I gotta wish you a happy birthday too! I have it in my calendar.

930
01:02:59,656 --> 01:03:04,156
Oh, yeah, thank you! Well, it's still a long time to go... but I was so surprised when I realized...

931
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:08,156
wait, what? Calli's birthday already? Now? What? It felt like just yesterday when you had your last one.

932
01:03:09,156 --> 01:03:14,156
I know! Time really flies. Well, I'm gonna eat lots and lots of KFP on your birthday.

933
01:03:14,156 --> 01:03:16,156
Nom nom nom nom...

934
01:03:16,656 --> 01:03:22,156
I have a question! But I would prefer... like a... a cake that looks like fried chicken, but it's actually a cake.

935
01:03:22,156 --> 01:03:26,656
You know those fake cakes? That is a real thing. People do know how to do that. Yeah, that's crazy.

936
01:03:27,156 --> 01:03:31,156
Well, I have a question for you, Wawa. What do you want to see me do this year?

937
01:03:31,656 --> 01:03:35,656
This year in general? Yeah, don't say 'take a break' because Bae said 'take a break'.

938
01:03:36,156 --> 01:03:41,156
I want you to realize some plans that you have on the... you know, what do you call it? Backburner?

939
01:03:41,156 --> 01:03:45,156
Or like, not backburner, I don't know, but... Oh yeah!

940
01:03:45,156 --> 01:03:49,156
Plans that you have had since like maybe a year or so.

941
01:03:49,156 --> 01:03:52,156
And just make them a reality this year. You know what I mean?

942
01:03:54,156 --> 01:03:59,156
I know what you... I think I know what you mean. Definitely. Wink wink, wonk wonk.

943
01:03:59,156 --> 01:04:06,156
Wink wink, wonk wonk! I like that idea. Okay, well you've inspired me now, Kiara. Okay, I'll do it! I'll do it!

944
01:04:06,656 --> 01:04:12,656
Okay! Just do it! Just do it! Can you give me like, with the hand poses, like, you know,

945
01:04:12,656 --> 01:04:16,156
walking around and then with the finger onto the hand?

946
01:04:17,156 --> 01:04:22,156
Just... Oh, yeah, wait, hold on. The finger onto the hand? Yeah, maybe you can't take the props off, that's okay.

947
01:04:24,156 --> 01:04:28,156
Just do it! Don't let your dreams be dreams! Do it!

948
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:33,656
Do it! Something like that. Yeah! I'll do it too! I'll do whatever!

949
01:04:33,656 --> 01:04:37,656
You should do it too! Hey, also, you get a request for the next song that I'm singing.

950
01:04:37,656 --> 01:04:41,156
What kind of like dance move or pose do you want to see me do?

951
01:04:41,656 --> 01:04:44,156
What kind of like dance move or pose do you want to see me do?

952
01:04:45,156 --> 01:04:48,156
Do you know like roughly what the vogue dance style is?

953
01:04:48,156 --> 01:04:50,156
Um, can you give me an example? Vogue?

954
01:04:50,156 --> 01:04:54,156
I think... Oh, hi IRyS! That's the first word I hear!

955
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:58,656
I said hi, Kiara! I was like, 'Hi Kiara!'. I'm here, I'm invisible!

956
01:04:58,656 --> 01:05:01,156
IRyS, you can vogue too! Do you know how to vogue?

957
01:05:01,156 --> 01:05:03,484
What is that? What is that? You don't know? Well, it's like...

958
01:05:04,164 --> 01:05:05,464
...I mean, there's like several

959
01:05:05,464 --> 01:05:06,464
parts to voguing,

960
01:05:06,464 --> 01:05:09,264
but I think like what I want to see you do

961
01:05:09,264 --> 01:05:11,364
is like over your head, like frantically

962
01:05:11,364 --> 01:05:13,764
move your arms over your head like,

963
01:05:13,764 --> 01:05:15,964
you know, like swirl and twirl

964
01:05:15,964 --> 01:05:17,464
and then one hand to the left, one to the right and so...

965
01:05:21,464 --> 01:05:23,564
舞踏（ダンス）の方、
Dancers,

966
01:05:23,564 --> 01:05:25,464
ヴォーグ（Vogue）してますか？
are you voguing?

967
01:05:25,464 --> 01:05:26,664
Oh!

968
01:05:26,664 --> 01:05:27,764
Oh, she's doing it!

969
01:05:27,764 --> 01:05:28,864
Yeah!

970
01:05:28,864 --> 01:05:30,764
Kind of copy... kind of copy what she's doing.

971
01:05:30,764 --> 01:05:31,864
Oh yeah!

972
01:05:31,864 --> 01:05:33,464
Oh yeah, she's showing you!

973
01:05:33,464 --> 01:05:34,464
Yeah!

974
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:36,564
She is a pro dancer after all.

975
01:05:36,564 --> 01:05:37,564
Yeah, yeah.

976
01:05:37,564 --> 01:05:39,464
Okay, if you could vogue together with your dancer

977
01:05:39,464 --> 01:05:41,564
doing the- maybe during every chorus, vogue.

978
01:05:41,564 --> 01:05:42,964
Okay.

979
01:05:42,964 --> 01:05:44,064
Every chorus.

980
01:05:44,064 --> 01:05:45,264
Every chorus.

981
01:05:45,264 --> 01:05:46,264
All right, I'll try.

982
01:05:46,264 --> 01:05:48,364
浴びるほどに、ヴォーグ（Vogue）お願いします。
Please vogue as much as you can soak in.

983
01:05:48,364 --> 01:05:50,164
As much as I can, I will.

984
01:05:50,164 --> 01:05:51,464
よろしく！
Best of luck!

985
01:05:51,464 --> 01:05:52,464
よろしくね。
Best of luck to you too.

986
01:05:52,464 --> 01:05:53,964
Oh gosh, she's giving me a hard one.

987
01:05:53,964 --> 01:05:55,664
All right, I'll do my best.

988
01:05:55,664 --> 01:05:56,564
Thanks, Kiuawa.

989
01:05:56,564 --> 01:05:57,764
Have fun!

990
01:05:57,764 --> 01:05:59,464
Talk to you later, Kiara. Bye!

991
01:05:59,464 --> 01:06:00,364
Bye!

992
01:06:00,364 --> 01:06:01,164
Yeah.

993
01:06:01,164 --> 01:06:02,964
Oh, hold on one second, everybody.

994
01:06:02,964 --> 01:06:04,764
We're gonna fix IRyS for a second

995
01:06:04,764 --> 01:06:06,664
and I'm gonna put away the phone really quick.

996
01:06:06,664 --> 01:06:07,664
Can you fix me?

997
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:08,764
I love you, Kiuawa! Bye!

998
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:10,164
I love you too, bye bye!

999
01:06:10,164 --> 01:06:11,564
Bye, Kiara!

1000
01:06:11,564 --> 01:06:12,564
Bye!

1001
01:06:12,564 --> 01:06:13,664
There we go.

1002
01:06:13,664 --> 01:06:14,964
We're fixing IRyS.

1003
01:06:14,964 --> 01:06:17,164
She doesn't need to be fixed in my opinion, but that's okay.

1004
01:06:17,164 --> 01:06:18,464
I'm perfect the way I am!

1005
01:06:18,464 --> 01:06:19,964
Exactly.

1006
01:06:19,964 --> 01:06:22,564
Hold on, let me try the vogue thing.

1007
01:06:22,564 --> 01:06:23,664
Yeah, you're doing it!

1008
01:06:23,664 --> 01:06:25,164
You're doing it!

1009
01:06:25,164 --> 01:06:26,564
You're doing it!

1010
01:06:26,564 --> 01:06:27,864
I see it!

1011
01:06:27,864 --> 01:06:29,964
I'm trying.

1012
01:06:29,964 --> 01:06:31,664
It's beautiful!

1013
01:06:31,664 --> 01:06:32,564
Thank you.

1014
01:06:32,564 --> 01:06:33,564
ありがとう。
Thank you.

1015
01:06:33,564 --> 01:06:34,564
Thank you.

1016
01:06:34,564 --> 01:06:36,464
Thank you very much, Gaikotsu-chan.

1017
01:06:36,464 --> 01:06:37,564
Thank you.

1018
01:06:37,564 --> 01:06:39,464
Gaikotsu-chan is very cute.

1019
01:06:39,464 --> 01:06:41,564
She's scared of me though, I think.

1020
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:42,764
Oh no, I don't think so.

1021
01:06:42,764 --> 01:06:44,164
I don't think so.

1022
01:06:44,164 --> 01:06:46,664
She's just a little shy, but she's very outgoing around me.

1023
01:06:46,664 --> 01:06:47,864
Yeah.

1024
01:06:47,864 --> 01:06:49,464
Okay.

1025
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:50,664
Cool, cool, cool.

1026
01:06:50,664 --> 01:06:53,164
Well, I wonder what we should do after this.

1027
01:06:53,164 --> 01:06:54,664
Here, let me sit down for a second.

1028
01:06:54,664 --> 01:06:57,464
I still have a couple songs I want to sing you guys.

1029
01:06:57,464 --> 01:06:59,464
I want to sing some more songs.

1030
01:06:59,464 --> 01:07:01,164
Um...

1031
01:07:01,164 --> 01:07:02,864
I'll do my best.

1032
01:07:02,864 --> 01:07:05,164
We got some emotional ones in there too.

1033
01:07:05,164 --> 01:07:06,664
Oh boy, oh man.

1034
01:07:06,664 --> 01:07:10,164
And also we have some announcements, so don't go anywhere.

1035
01:07:10,164 --> 01:07:14,164
But I really hope you guys have enjoyed the show so far.

1036
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:18,464
I know that this is a lot more like casual and like cozy and whatnot.

1037
01:07:18,464 --> 01:07:22,664
It's not like a really big grand showcase or anything like that.

1038
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:24,364
But I think that's okay.

1039
01:07:24,364 --> 01:07:26,664
You know, you guys always tell me that I should have more fun

1040
01:07:26,664 --> 01:07:28,864
um, you know, just having a good time singing

1041
01:07:28,864 --> 01:07:31,664
and worry less about like how high quality everything is all the time

1042
01:07:31,664 --> 01:07:34,164
and stress myself out over it, you know?

1043
01:07:34,164 --> 01:07:35,164
I'm fixed!

1044
01:07:35,164 --> 01:07:36,564
She's fixed.

1045
01:07:36,564 --> 01:07:39,564
Speaking of which, looking very high quality.

1046
01:07:39,564 --> 01:07:40,664
Thank you!

1047
01:07:40,664 --> 01:07:43,664
I'm a high-quality PNG floating around.

1048
01:07:43,664 --> 01:07:45,664
Oh, well I can't wait for your 3D!

1049
01:07:45,664 --> 01:07:46,664
Thank you, Calli.

1050
01:07:46,664 --> 01:07:48,164
It's gonna be fun.

1051
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:49,464
Very fun, too.

1052
01:07:49,464 --> 01:07:51,464
I want to sing with you in 3D again.

1053
01:07:51,464 --> 01:07:52,464
We'll do it!

1054
01:07:52,464 --> 01:07:54,164
Just like we did at the Fest, yeah?

1055
01:07:54,164 --> 01:07:55,464
Yay!

1056
01:07:55,464 --> 01:07:56,564
Definitely.

1057
01:07:56,564 --> 01:07:57,764
Alrighty then,

1058
01:07:57,764 --> 01:07:59,464
well since my body is fixed now,

1059
01:07:59,464 --> 01:08:02,564
I think I should be heading off to do my Nephilim duties,

1060
01:08:02,564 --> 01:08:04,464
maybe perhaps an idol meeting.

1061
01:08:04,464 --> 01:08:05,464
An idol meeting?

1062
01:08:05,464 --> 01:08:07,564
Maybe perhaps an idol meeting

1063
01:08:07,564 --> 01:08:09,864
that I've been- that I've been getting an emergency alert for, for a bit.

1064
01:08:09,864 --> 01:08:11,564
Stop!

1065
01:08:11,564 --> 01:08:12,664
Get out, IRyS!

1066
01:08:12,664 --> 01:08:14,164
Not in my karaoke room!

1067
01:08:14,164 --> 01:08:15,164
Oy!

1068
01:08:15,164 --> 01:08:16,464
I need to go!

1069
01:08:16,464 --> 01:08:17,464
I'm a fly!

1070
01:08:17,464 --> 01:08:18,464
Get out!

1071
01:08:18,464 --> 01:08:19,464
Get out!

1072
01:08:19,464 --> 01:08:20,764
Bye, IRyS!

1073
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:21,764
Get out, IRyS!

1074
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,564
Bye-RyS!

1075
01:08:23,564 --> 01:08:24,564
Get out!

1076
01:08:24,564 --> 01:08:26,164
She's leaving now.

1077
01:08:26,164 --> 01:08:27,164
Yay.

1078
01:08:27,164 --> 01:08:29,164
I was- I was really quite-

1079
01:08:29,164 --> 01:08:30,464
I was lonely.

1080
01:08:30,464 --> 01:08:32,564
I mean, I know that I have my Dead Beats here

1081
01:08:32,564 --> 01:08:34,964
...but it's even better with friends, right?

1082
01:08:34,964 --> 01:08:35,964
Yeah.

1083
01:08:35,964 --> 01:08:37,564
Huh.

1084
01:08:37,564 --> 01:08:39,464
Anyway, I guess we should sing some more songs.

1085
01:08:39,464 --> 01:08:40,664
Is that okay?

1086
01:08:40,664 --> 01:08:42,964
I think I've sufficiently rested enough.

1087
01:08:42,964 --> 01:08:44,164
Okay.

1088
01:08:44,164 --> 01:08:45,464
Well let's sing.

1089
01:08:45,464 --> 01:08:48,164
Let's continue singing, that's what we're here for, right?

1090
01:08:48,164 --> 01:08:50,664
I've got a couple more songs in me.

1091
01:08:50,664 --> 01:08:51,664
So let's go!

1092
01:08:51,664 --> 01:08:53,164
歌いましょう！
Let's sing!

01:10:57,537 --> 01:10:59,403
笑う やがて
...laugh. Soon...

1123
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:02,937
感情を消し去った
...they erased my emotions.

1124
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:07,403
それでも存在理由など あとで決めるもの 笑う独り
Even so, things like a reason for existence
are determined later, laughing alone.

1125
01:11:07,537 --> 01:11:11,370
祈りの導きのままに
Following the guidance of prayer.

1126
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:19,736
気づいた代償 答えに隠れた
The realized compensation, hidden in the answer.

1127
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:30,337
さよなら愛しき日々 戻れないのは
Goodbye, beloved days.
The reason I can't return is...

1128
01:11:30,437 --> 01:11:37,102
僕だけでいいから
...because I'm the only one who needs to.

1129
01:11:55,403 --> 01:12:00,270
イカサマライフゲイム 雁首そろえたジョーカーは 笑う
Cheating Life Game, the Jokers lined up
side-by-side laugh.

1130
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:03,937
やがて惨状は訪れる
Soon, the disastrous scene will arrive.

1131
01:12:04,337 --> 01:12:08,970
最後の通達 嫌に明快に
The final notice is disgustingly clear:

1132
01:12:09,503 --> 01:12:14,170
「明日君はどう頑張ったって死にますよ」
"Tomorrow, no matter how hard you try,
you're going to die."

1133
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:18,970
イカサマライフゲイム 雁首そろえたジョーカーは 笑う
Cheating Life Game, the Jokers lined up
side-by-side laugh.

1134
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:21,003
笑え
Laugh!

1135
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,903
ババ抜きじゃ仕方ない おかえり感情
In this game of Old Maid, it's no use.
Welcome back, emotions.

1136
01:12:25,003 --> 01:12:29,370
死ぬほどの不安が愛しくて 笑う独り
The deathly anxiety is so precious, laughing alone.

1137
01:12:29,503 --> 01:12:33,303
祈りの導きのままに
Following the guidance of prayer.

1138
01:12:33,503 --> 01:12:36,270
明日雨は降るかな
I wonder if it will rain tomorrow.

1139
01:13:07,137 --> 01:13:09,970
一番の宝物
My Most Precious Treasure

1140
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:26,370
裾が濡れたなら
If the hem of my clothes gets wet,

1141
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:30,337
乾くの待てばいい
I'll just wait for it to dry.

1142
01:13:31,037 --> 01:13:34,637
水音をたてて
Making the sound of water,

1143
01:13:34,937 --> 01:13:37,337
跳ねた
it splashed.

1144
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:42,970
きみが教えてくれたんだ もう怖くない
You were the one who taught me.
I'm not afraid anymore.

1145
01:13:45,403 --> 01:13:48,170
生きていてくれた
You stayed alive for me.

1146
01:13:48,436 --> 01:13:54,436
この手を離さなきゃだめだ
I have to let go of this hand.

1147
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:05,970
ひとりでもゆくよ
Even alone, I will go on.

1148
01:14:06,437 --> 01:14:11,003
たとえ辛くても
Even if it's painful.

1149
01:14:11,503 --> 01:14:16,370
みんなで見た夢は
The dream we all saw together,

1150
01:14:16,437 --> 01:14:18,970
必ず持ってくよ
I'll definitely take it with me.

1151
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:23,003
みんなとがいいな
Being with everyone would be nice.

1152
01:14:23,503 --> 01:14:26,970
みんなとがよかった
Being with everyone was good.

1153
01:14:27,237 --> 01:14:30,970
でも目覚めた朝
But on the morning I woke up,

1154
01:14:31,437 --> 01:14:34,370
誰もいないんだね
there was no one there.

1155
01:14:51,603 --> 01:14:55,403
もう振り返っても
Even if I look back now,

1156
01:14:55,470 --> 01:14:58,870
だれの影もない
there's no one's shadow.

1157
01:14:59,403 --> 01:15:01,377
水たまり
A puddle...

1158
01:15:02,183 --> 01:15:05,683
...だけが 気があった
...Only that, I noticed

1159
01:15:06,183 --> 01:15:09,883
生きていくこと それは立ち向かっていくこと
Living is about facing forward

1160
01:15:15,283 --> 01:15:18,983
それがわかったなら
Once you understand that,

1161
01:15:18,983 --> 01:15:23,283
あとは踏み出す勇気だけ
all that's left is the courage to take a step

1162
01:15:30,883 --> 01:15:34,683
どこまでもゆくよ ここで知ったこと
I'll go anywhere, with what I've learned here

1163
01:15:37,983 --> 01:15:45,783
幸せという夢をかなえてみせるよ
I'll show you that I can make the dream of happiness come true

1164
01:15:46,983 --> 01:15:54,083
みんなと離れても どんなに遠くなっても
Even if I'm separated from everyone, no matter how far away I get

1165
01:15:55,483 --> 01:16:01,383
新しい明日に この僕は生きるよ
In the new tomorrow, I will live

1166
01:16:33,983 --> 01:16:38,483
一人でもゆくよ 死にたくなっても
I'll go even alone, even if I feel like dying

1167
01:16:42,383 --> 01:16:47,983
声が聞こえるよ 死んではいけないと
I can hear a voice saying I must not die

1168
01:16:51,683 --> 01:16:57,983
たとえ辛くても 闇に閉ざされても
Even if it's painful, even if I'm shut in the darkness

1169
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:06,083
心の奥には 灯りがともってるよ
In the depths of my heart, a light is burning

1170
01:17:07,683 --> 01:17:12,683
巡って流れて 時は移ろい
Circling and flowing, time changes

1171
01:17:12,683 --> 01:17:19,483
もう何があったか 思い出せないけど
I can't remember what happened anymore, but...

1172
01:17:20,683 --> 01:17:29,083
目を閉じてみれば みんなの笑い声
If I close my eyes, I hear everyone's laughter

1173
01:17:30,183 --> 01:17:36,683
なぜかそれが今 一番の宝物
For some reason, that is my greatest treasure now

1174
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:11,083
Now, I'll sing one more song.

1175
01:18:19,183 --> 01:18:23,483
離れる頃 桜散る 全てが愛おしい
When we part, cherry blossoms fall, everything is precious

1176
01:18:23,983 --> 01:18:32,983
セピアの心情を 開いては また想い耽る
Opening up my sepia emotions, I lose myself in thought again

1177
01:18:34,883 --> 01:18:39,183
SAKURA Days

1178
01:18:39,783 --> 01:18:43,983
賑わいと 温もりを
They brought bustle and warmth

1179
01:18:43,983 --> 01:18:48,983
運んでくれた
they carried me through

1180
01:18:49,883 --> 01:18:58,083
おかげで 色づいた花
Thanks to that, the flowers bloomed with color

1181
01:18:59,383 --> 01:19:03,983
ある者は焦がれて
Some long for it,

1182
01:19:03,983 --> 01:19:08,983
ある者は皆で分かち合い
some share it with everyone

1183
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:18,383
羨望の眼差しを 向ける者も
Some even cast looks of envy

1184
01:19:19,383 --> 01:19:24,383
舞い散る夜風に 秘めた切な愛おしい
In the dancing night breeze, a hidden painful endearment

1185
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:32,583
サヨナラとありがとう 共に贈るよ
I send both my goodbyes and my thanks

1186
01:19:33,383 --> 01:19:38,083
おかげで また好きになった
Thanks to you, I've come to like it again

1187
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:42,683
去る者を追えるはずなく
No way to chase those who leave,

1188
01:19:42,683 --> 01:19:47,583
来る者は拒めるわけない
no way to refuse those who come

1189
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:57,583
故に尊い 桜色の 日々よ
Thus, the precious cherry-blossom-colored days

1190
01:19:58,983 --> 01:20:01,383
離れる頃 桜...
When we part, cherry...

1191
01:20:00,808 --> 01:20:03,208
葬らされる全てが愛おしい
Everything that's buried is so dear

1192
01:20:03,208 --> 01:20:07,708
セピアの心情を
These sepia-toned feelings

1193
01:20:07,708 --> 01:20:13,708
開いてはまた思い耽る
Opening them up, I'm lost in thought again

1194
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:18,708
SAKURA Days

1195
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:23,708
遥か彼方響く君の声に耳を澄ませば
If I listen closely to your voice echoing from afar

1196
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:29,208
少なからずその温もり思い出せるように
So that I can remember at least a little of that warmth

1197
01:20:29,208 --> 01:20:36,208
凛とした寂しさも風情と成る
Even this dignified loneliness becomes part of the scenery

1198
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:43,208
SAKURA Days

1199
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:46,208
SAKURA Days

1200
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:49,208
SAKURA Days

1201
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:54,208
少なからずその温もり思い出せるように
So that I can remember at least a little of that warmth

1202
01:20:54,208 --> 01:21:03,708
麗しき SAKURA Days
Beautiful SAKURA Days

1203
01:21:03,708 --> 01:21:10,708
La la la la SAKURA Days

1204
01:21:10,708 --> 01:21:14,208
Woah SAKURA Days

1205
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:18,208
SAKURA Days

1206
01:21:26,008 --> 01:21:27,308
Thank you.

1207
01:21:27,308 --> 01:21:31,708
Everyone, thank you so much for coming to my karaoke party.

1208
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:34,708
I have one more announcement, two more announcements, but one really big one.

1209
01:21:34,708 --> 01:21:37,208
One really big announcement, okay?

1210
01:21:38,208 --> 01:21:39,208

1238
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:17,708
It's very limited, um, 'cause we can't make a million of these.

1239
01:23:17,708 --> 01:23:20,208
You guys know that there's, you know, kind of...

1240

I hope that you remember me. This was a really fun stream.

1255
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:19,708
Thank you so much you guys. Thanks for spending time with me, thanks for singing with me.
