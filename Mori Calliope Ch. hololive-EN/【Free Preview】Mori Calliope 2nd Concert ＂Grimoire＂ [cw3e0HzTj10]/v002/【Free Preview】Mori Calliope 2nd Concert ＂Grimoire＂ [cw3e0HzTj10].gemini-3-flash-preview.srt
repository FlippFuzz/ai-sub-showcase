311
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:43,401
Now first, I want the whole venue to turn red,

312
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:47,301
like the voltage of Hell is going up. Come on, give me red, give me red!

313
00:51:47,401 --> 00:51:49,401
And when this red runs black...

314
00:51:49,501 --> 00:51:52,601
Yeah, yeah. Alright.

315
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:56,701
Now listen to me, this is important. You turn the penlight into red

316
00:51:56,801 --> 00:51:59,201
when you feel super hyped, which is going to be all the time,

317
00:51:59,301 --> 00:52:02,001
but you know, if you overdo it, it's not as special.

318
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:05,201
Kind of like, you know, solo lives are rare, we don't get to do them all the time.

319
00:52:05,301 --> 00:52:08,601
But they become more special, so use it only when you're super hyped, okay?

320
00:52:08,701 --> 00:52:09,701
Now then.

321
00:52:14,701 --> 00:52:17,501
Yeah, you guys are excited, I can tell.

322
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,801
Now let me hear something though. I want to know,

323
00:52:19,901 --> 00:52:22,501
where are you from?

324
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:35,201
USA! USA! USA! USA! Stop, man! You boneheads!

325
00:52:39,001 --> 00:52:42,601
Crazily enough, the only state that I heard was Oregon. Why?

326
00:52:46,001 --> 00:52:48,201
No, but then I got a little bit of everybody in there.

327
00:52:48,301 --> 00:52:50,801
So wherever you're from, thank you so much for coming out to see me.

328
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,601
It's very important to me. Thank you.

329
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:56,701
You Dead Beats rock! You know that though.

330
00:52:59,701 --> 00:53:02,401
Now, alrighty, also here's the thing though,

331
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:05,401
we don't just have people here in the venue,

332
00:53:05,501 --> 00:53:08,301
we also have people watching on the internet, on stream!

333
00:53:09,301 --> 00:53:12,701
What's up guys? Hello! I see you, I see you. Hi, hi, hi!

334
00:53:13,701 --> 00:53:16,401
I'm looking at you, Dead Beat at home, Dead Beat at home.

335
00:53:16,501 --> 00:53:18,701
We love you, we miss you. Hi!

336
00:53:19,701 --> 00:53:22,401
"That's us," they say. "That's me, that's me."

337
00:53:22,501 --> 00:53:23,701
Let's go!

338
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:27,201
Now, you guys... they have so many different chants.

339
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:29,601
Chat! Chat! Chat! Chat!

340
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:36,201
Chat! Chat! Chat! Chat! That's you guys. Chat! Chat! Chat! Chat!

341
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:38,601
Thank you so much! Chat! Chat!

342
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:40,001
ありがとうございます！
Thank you very much!

343
00:53:40,101 --> 00:53:41,401
Nice beat! いいね！
Nice beat! Nice!

344
00:53:41,501 --> 00:53:43,401
Yeah, chat, chat... alright, time to stop that, time to...

345
00:53:47,001 --> 00:53:49,401
Okay. Now that we've gotten that out of our system,

346
00:53:49,501 --> 00:53:52,501
you guys who are watching this stream,

347
00:53:52,601 --> 00:53:55,301
have the opportunity to do the coolest thing right now.

348
00:53:55,401 --> 00:54:00,001
Post your impressions on Twitter, okay? #CalliGrimoire

349
00:54:00,501 --> 00:54:03,501
No recording videos, but feel free to take lots of screenshots of me

350
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:06,201
doing silly stuff and singing and performing, okay?

351
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:09,401
But sadly, those of you watching on YouTube, I have some bad news for you.

352
00:54:15,201 --> 00:54:18,401
It's all over, the free preview is over! And you know what?

353
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:23,701
We haven't even gotten to like the sixth or seventh most hype moment

354
00:54:23,801 --> 00:54:26,201
that's going to happen tonight.

355
00:54:29,501 --> 00:54:32,701
Broke-gang, listen. I feel you. But, but,

356
00:54:32,801 --> 00:54:36,201
make sure that you check out the link in the description below

357
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:40,201
and see if you can, if you can, you know...

358
00:54:40,301 --> 00:54:43,201
Cop yourself... BUY IT! Yeah!

359
00:54:43,301 --> 00:54:46,701
I like that Dead Beat who's like "BUY IT!" Yeah!

360
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:49,401
You have the assertiveness I need.

361
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:53,401
Awesome, my freaking boneheads. Now then,

362
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:56,501
listen up Dead Beats, we got to continue as much as I want to keep talking

363
00:54:56,601 --> 00:54:59,201
so I can like chill for a minute. Listen,

364
00:54:59,701 --> 00:55:03,201
today I brought a bunch of songs here to harvest your souls.

365
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:05,201
It's my job, don't hate me.

366
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,720
Don't hate me. Heh heh.

367
00:55:10,353 --> 00:55:13,320
Are you ready to be soaked in Mori's music? That's terrible.

368
00:55:13,387 --> 00:55:14,620
That's terrible.

369
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,720
I hate that. I hate that that was in the script.

370
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,987
Forget the script. Let's just go crazy, right?

371
00:55:22,087 --> 00:55:23,587
Right!

372
00:55:25,253 --> 00:55:27,753
No script, no script, we're just running it.

373
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:29,320
Next song!

374
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,853
Next song!

375
00:55:31,153 --> 00:55:33,353
Let's go!

376
00:55:40,187 --> 01:00:04,187
