I'm a ruthless dame.

19
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,900
No way, no way out, way out, way out.

20
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,400
Good versus evil, so who've I become?

21
00:03:02,503 --> 00:03:05,500
Just sit back and party, just leave it to one.

22
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:09,300

皆さん!
Everyone!

105
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:55,333
Welcome, welcome to a very special showing

106
00:07:55,433 --> 00:08:00,133
of several songs from my brand new album, PHANTOMIME.

107
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:05,133
As you can see, the stage that I'm performing on today

108
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:09,633
is a bit different than the usual that you might be used to.

109
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:13,233
But we wanted to make this kind of like...

110
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:17,133
...I don't know, a more intimate feeling setting, I guess.

111
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:20,633
And I know that you guys at home are watching,

112
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:25,233
so I'm just kind of imagining the audience all around me.

113
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,733
But yeah, it kind of feels like a TV live to be honest.

114
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,333
It's really cool. I love all of the different settings

115
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,633
that they have come up with here.

116
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:37,333
Just now I performed two songs

117
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,933
that I've already done before off of the album.

118
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:44,833
Two songs that you guys are very familiar with, of course.

119
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:50,033
GOGETTERS from Suicide Squad Isekai ending,

120
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:55,933
and then also Overkill, which is one of my craziest songs yet,

121
00:08:56,033 --> 00:09:00,133
that I have released the music video for on my channel.

122
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:04,233
Probably one of my favorite songs that I've ever made,

123
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:08,833
and definitely a good follow-up to JIGOKU 6.

124
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:12,633
But from here on out, I think that I'd like to do

125
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:15,933
some songs that you guys haven't heard yet.

126
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:19,433
In fact, I think I'd like to perform two of them,

127
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:23,033
and maybe, maybe another one after that

128
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:26,933
if you guys are really feeling it, I don't know.

129
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,633
But the next song that I would like to introduce

130
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:33,833
is a song called "Cult Following".

131
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:37,433
It's my collaboration song with Worgasm.

132
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:41,133
And then after that, after that song,

133
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:45,633
I will perform a song that you guys have been waiting for

134
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:49,033
for a long time, and I know you guys are really excited.

135
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,345
I'm super excited about,

136
00:10:01,345 --> 00:10:02,345
but I won't spoil the surprise.

137
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:03,345
So with that being said,

138
00:10:03,345 --> 00:10:05,145
let's go. Check it out.

139
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:07,345
Cult Following.

140
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:38,245
Cult Following

141
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:38,845
Could you rub the eyes?

142
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:41,245
This ain't the only battlefield

143
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:43,745
I can tell of vibes

144
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:45,645
Ego was a non, so I put

145
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,845
the camera down and faced it

146
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:50,045
They went and got complacent

147
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:52,445
Come and run with me

148
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:54,445
You say you stand for nothing,

149
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,745
no one else can relate

150
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:58,245
Just know the company you keep

151
00:10:58,245 --> 00:10:59,245
is in the business of hate

152
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:00,045
Are you afraid?

153
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:01,245
Don't run away

154
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:02,545
I'm close to getting paid

155
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:05,045
Dancing on my own

156
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:06,445
in a bulletproof vest

157
00:11:06,445 --> 00:11:08,545
Going shoot-shoot-shoot,

158
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:10,045
oh baby did you miss?

159
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,445
Ricochet, Ricochet

160
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:13,545
You can think about me

161
00:11:13,545 --> 00:11:14,345
anytime of any day

162
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:15,545
Forget your street fights,

163
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:16,845
this a trench war

164
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:19,445
I'll make you march-march-march

165
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,545
'til you hit the floor

166
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:22,045
Getting thirsty for collision

167
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:24,445
let them wonder what they're missing

168
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:25,545
in the front row

169
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:26,545
Now here we go

170
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:27,845
This ain't a lifeline,

171
00:11:27,845 --> 00:11:29,045
it's a call to arms

172
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:30,345
Become the wizard,

173
00:11:30,345 --> 00:11:31,545
the unforgiven

174
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:32,745
Make a decision,

175
00:11:32,745 --> 00:11:34,845
if you're looking for permission

176
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:35,845
to riot you got it wrong

177
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:37,445
Say goodbye to your identity,

178
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:38,245
click flash,

179
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:40,045
now you belong

180
00:11:40,045 --> 00:11:42,345
The situation isn't fluid at all

181
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:44,245
Took out my reddest paint markers

182
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,045
and I ruined the wall

183
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:47,845
It's not that complicated

184
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:49,245
I could choose to run but I crawl

185
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:51,145
Just let the anchors of the skeptics sink

186
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,545
or watch as we fall

187
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,645
I'll be dancing on my own

188
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:56,245
in a bulletproof vest

189
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:58,245
Going shoot-shoot-shoot,

190
00:11:58,245 --> 00:11:59,545
oh baby did you miss?

191
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:01,045
Ricochet, Ricochet

192
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:03,045
You can think about me

193
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:04,245
anytime of any day

194
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:05,645
Forget your street fights,

195
00:12:05,645 --> 00:12:06,845
this a trench war

196
00:12:06,845 --> 00:12:09,645
I'll make you march-march-march

197
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,045
'til you hit the floor

198
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:12,445
Getting thirsty for collision

199
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:14,645
let them wonder what they're missing

200
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:16,245
in the front row

201
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:17,345
Now here we go

202
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:18,545
This ain't a lifeline,

203
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:19,845
it's a call to arms

204
00:12:19,845 --> 00:12:21,045
Become the wizard,

205
00:12:21,045 --> 00:12:22,245
the unforgiven

206
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:23,445
Make a decision,

207
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:25,445
if you're looking for permission

208
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,545

209
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,145

now you belong

212
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:35,045
Dancing on my own

213
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,045
in a bulletproof vest

214
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:40,445
Going shoot-shoot-shoot,

215
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:42,545
I'm gonna see who shoots best

216
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:45,845
Fighting all your battles

217
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:47,345
now they're kind to fail

218
00:12:47,345 --> 00:12:49,245
They go ready-set-rage,

219
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:50,545
and then they follow us to hell

220
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:51,645
Finger on the trigger,

221
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,045
bout to cock it and run

222
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:54,445
Got a lyric in the chamber,

223
00:12:54,445 --> 00:12:56,245
but I'm holding my own gun

224
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,245
Forget your street fights,

225
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,345
this a trench war

226
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:03,045

locking

244
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:28,845
Locking

245
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:30,845
Stand for nothing

246
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:32,445
play the coward

247
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,445
Step by someone you've devoured

248
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:36,445
It's a sick and twisted mess,

249
00:13:36,445 --> 00:13:38,045
create and exist

250
00:13:38,045 --> 00:13:40,245
Let them, write you onward,

00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:41,545

Step by someone you've devoured

256
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:50,845
It's a sick and twisted mess,

create and exist

258
00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:18,245
DONMAI

259
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:29,045
Hello, again

260
00:14:29,045 --> 00:14:31,045
My head's just full

261
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:33,745
The tide is high,

262
00:14:33,745 --> 00:14:36,245
but I'm still low

263
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,045
Raise that gun like you're aiming for me, babe

264
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:44,245
Cut and run, we could never be free, yeah

265
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:46,045
There

266
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:48,545
is never any gold

267
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:50,545
Hide and seek, take a peek

268
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:52,545
at the skill that one can teach

269
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:54,645
A dance with the ideals

270
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,345
that you know you'll never reach

271
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:58,245
Picking a random one to be somebody

272
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,045
Telephone facts and poison wells...

273
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:01,407
Real tight up on your throat

274
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:02,557
Ride it steady through the gloat

275
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:03,807
Perfect sinners made of gold

276
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:04,957
Woah oh

277
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:06,457
People come and go

278
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:07,807
Only way that you can grow

279
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,157
Is not to give a damn at all

280
00:15:09,157 --> 00:15:10,557
Woah oh oh oh

281
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:12,457
Feel the drive

282
00:15:12,457 --> 00:15:15,957
One hell's breaking loose come dance with me

283
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:18,057
Fever dies

284
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:21,457
I am what I am in the rot and the meat

285
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:23,257
Kick it to the curb we're still in the fight

286
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:26,557
Never take the leap but I tell myself don't mind

287
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:29,857
Cause I'm betting all on me

288
00:15:31,857 --> 00:15:33,457
Still here burning with desire

289
00:15:33,457 --> 00:15:34,957
Don't you tell me that you're tired

290
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:37,357
Are you choking, maybe joking while they're stoking up the fire

291
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:39,957
People say you lost your vision but you see it crystal clear

292
00:15:39,957 --> 00:15:42,557
I'm making my own decisions before they let me disappear

293
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:44,257
What do you want from me?

294
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:45,657
Guess we'll never agree

295
00:15:45,657 --> 00:15:48,357
Believe in everybody ends up drowning in their own damn entropy

296
00:15:48,357 --> 00:15:49,857
Internet's the mojo

297
00:15:49,857 --> 00:15:50,857
You're addicted like I told ya

298
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:53,457
絡み合った神になって進めばいいんじゃねえの
You should just become intertwined gods and move forward, shouldn't you?

299
00:15:53,657 --> 00:15:54,857
People come and go

300
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:56,257
Only way that you can grow

301
00:15:56,257 --> 00:15:57,657
Is not to give a damn at all

302
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,057
Woah oh oh oh

303
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:01,357
Feel the drive

304
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:04,457
One hell's breaking loose come dance with me

305
00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:06,357
Fever dies

306
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:09,757
I am what I am in the rot and the meat

307
00:16:09,757 --> 00:16:11,457
Kick it to the curb we're still in the fight

308
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:14,757
Never take the leap but I tell myself don't mind

309
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,057
Cause I'm betting all on me

310
00:16:23,057 --> 00:16:24,057
Gimme the good moss, so

311
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:25,557
後に引けないshow, so
A show with no turning back, so

312
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:28,057
撒き散らして 喚き出して 当たり散らしbo, so
Scattering around, screaming out, throwing things around, boo, so

313
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:30,857
何番煎じ 何なのか分かんない自論 護生大事に
Cherishing discussions of repeated origins

314
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,257
ドヤ顔でかましてる愚鈍
Pulling a smug face while being foolish

315
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:36,057
笑わせんた 聞きませんな 君のそのアジェンダ
Don't make me laugh, I'm not listening to your agenda

316
00:16:36,057 --> 00:16:38,857
Let it be known 蹴ろよ I will never surrender
Let it be known, I will never surrender

317
00:16:38,857 --> 00:16:41,257
People come and go, there are highs and then there's lows

318
00:16:41,257 --> 00:16:44,257
Only way that you can grow is not to give a damn at all

319
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:57,257
Hello again

320
00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:59,857
My hair adjusts for show

321
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:02,557
But tide is high

322
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:07,557
But I'm not alone

323
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,657
Feel the drive

324
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:13,057
One hell's breaking loose come dance with me

325
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:14,857
Fever dies

326
00:17:14,857 --> 00:17:18,157
I am what I am in the rot and the meat

327
00:17:18,257 --> 00:17:19,957
Kick it to the curb we're still in the fight

328
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:23,157
Never take the leap but I tell myself don't mind

329
00:17:23,457 --> 00:17:26,557
Cause I'm betting all on me

330
00:17:26,657 --> 00:17:29,857
Don't mind because I'm betting on me, yeah

331
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:31,557
Feel the drive

332
00:17:31,557 --> 00:17:34,957
One hell's breaking loose come dance with me

333
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:36,857
Fever dies

334
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:40,157
I am what I am in the rot and the meat

335
00:17:40,257 --> 00:17:41,857
Kick it to the curb we're still in the fight

336
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:45,057
Never take the leap but I tell myself don't mind

337
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:51,557
Cause I'm betting all on me

338
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:58,857
Ah, thank you very much everybody!

339
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:03,457
That was "Don't Mind", my collaboration song with Jean-Ken Johnny of MAN WITH A MISSION.

340
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:07,357
Probably one of my favorite songs that I've ever made.

341
00:18:07,357 --> 00:18:11,857
I seriously, I can't stop kind of listening to it on my own because I'm really, really proud of how it turned out.

342
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:15,557
And I feel like I got to use, um, I guess,

343
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:20,157
a certain sort of like tone and and sound of my vocals that I don't use very often

344
00:18:20,157 --> 00:18:24,057
but I actually am like really happy with how it sounds.

345
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:26,557
And I hope that you guys also enjoyed it lots.

346
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:30,857
And, um, I feel like it's a song that I can show to my family.

347
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:33,857
I might even show it to my sister, which is crazy cause she's like hyper-normal person.

348
00:18:33,857 --> 00:18:34,857
I don't know.

349
00:18:34,857 --> 00:18:37,357
I think also my dad might really like this song, maybe.

350
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:41,157
But most of all, I hope you guys enjoyed it as I'm really quite proud of it.

351
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:45,857
And so yeah, those were two songs that I haven't performed before, you guys.

352
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:47,057
Oh my gosh.

353
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:48,357
初披露です。
This is the first performance.

354
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:49,257
でした。
It was.

355
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:52,557
It's like the first time, the first time that it was shown anywhere is Hatsuhiro.
It's like the first time, the first time that it was shown anywhere is the first public performance.

356
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:57,657
Um, so I hope that you guys enjoyed those two songs.

357
00:18:57,657 --> 00:19:02,057
But, since the vibes are really good right now and I think you guys are enjoying the show...

358
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:08,557
Um, let's go ahead and do one more song that you guys haven't heard me perform before.

359
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:12,457
The next song is called "Skeletons", produced by Yafumi-san.

360
00:19:12,457 --> 00:19:16,857
It's, uh, it's another one of those songs that I feel like you guys were kind of asking for

361
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:20,557
a little bit more of like a softer, more emotional piece.

362
00:19:20,557 --> 00:19:25,857
And so I put my heart into it. And I hope that you guys will enjoy it.

363
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:29,557
Please enjoy my performance of "Skeletons".

364
00:19:41,857 --> 00:19:44,257
Hold on, just let it go

365
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:45,057
skeltons
Skeletons

366
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:46,457
I shatter it all, time to decide

367
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:50,057
Veiled, scattered thought

368
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:52,557
Sever it loud, time to decide

369
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:54,857
Ahem... running low on time

370
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:59,857
It's all too broken inside to decide

371
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:03,069
Haaaah...

372
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:05,469
Just let it go

373
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:06,469
Shatter it all

374
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:08,169
Time to decide

375
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:10,169
Tides, get it done

376
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,169
Savor it loud

377
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,769
Time to decide

378
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:14,369
Ahem...

379
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:16,469
Running low on time

380
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:20,669
It's all too broken inside to decide

381
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:23,069
It's out of my control

382
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:25,869
We'll just stay on the downlow

383
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:27,969
With no direction to grow

384
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:32,469
For the seed of a dream that expanded and landed me high

385
00:20:32,469 --> 00:20:37,469
High... to high

386
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:41,369
There's got to be something I missed while on the ride

387
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:44,869
Haaaah...

388
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:48,369
The past escapes me

389
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:53,669
We're all just drifting

390
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:59,169
Let me go, let me go

391
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:02,169
Yeah

392
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:04,769
I'm in the in-between, both sides to swallow

393
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:07,469
Wit' use, costly, and lined inside the road

394
00:21:07,469 --> 00:21:10,669
My bad, under the この狂った状況なら
My bad, in this crazy situation

395
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,669
ポジションばかり気にしちゃってんね
I keep worrying about my position

396
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:13,569
I'm not great

397
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:16,869
And people ask why your as still a hot mess

398
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:19,469
Like they don't figure that improvement's a process

399
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,969
You lose some, you talk less, you work on your aim

400
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:24,469
And spare the others that are followin' meaningless shame

401
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:27,269
At times I cannot see the point of me bein' here

402
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:29,969
Well, I'll reminisce about it all in a couple of years

403
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:32,769
The age of misfit, optimist that I missed it

404
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:35,369
Until I flashback to every wall that my fist hit

405
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:37,769
At my limit when I'm quick to give up the fight

406
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:40,469
Miracles gather in the mundane and they catch the light

407
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:41,469
I notice

408
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:42,569
Alright, jump

409
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:43,769
だって火花散り舞って
Because the sparks are scattering

410
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,069
捨てたような日がある後も、Out of control
Even after the days I feel like I've thrown away, out of control

411
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:48,069
It's out of my control

412
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:50,869
We'll just stay on the downlow

413
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:53,169
With no direction to grow

414
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:57,669
For the seed of a dream that expanded and landed me high

415
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:02,669
High... to high

416
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:06,069
There's got to be something we missed while on the ride

417
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:09,569
If this is only the beginning of the fiction we've read

418
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:13,269
Over and over like a fairy tale that doesn't leave your head

419
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:17,369
I'll make believe that happily ever after waits at the end

420
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:23,069
While just imagining the stories I would rather live instead

421
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:26,569
Can't fix all the cracks

422
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:29,869
Like washing skeletons

423
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:33,369
Can't fix all the cracks

424
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:36,569
Like washing skeletons

425
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:40,069
Can't fix all the cracks

426
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:42,069
手を伸ばさ
Reaching out

427
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,269
この目で
With these eyes

428
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:47,469
見届ける
I'll see it through

429
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:53,169
未だどこかに在る誰もいない
Still somewhere where no one else is

430
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:57,569
私のことは何も気にしないで
Don't worry about me at all

431
00:22:57,569 --> 00:23:03,069
この痛みの姿かたちでさえも
Even the shape and form of this pain

432
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:06,869
直に正しい方へ進んでいった
Soon began to move in the right direction

433
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:12,069
それが光のように見えたはずだ
It should have looked like light

434
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:15,569
Haaaah...

435
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:20,069
The past escapes me

436
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:25,569
We're all just drifting

437
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:30,869
Let me go, let me go

438
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:34,069
Yeah

439
00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:47,069
Thank you.

440
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:51,569
That was Skeletons, my collaboration song with Yafure-san.

441
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:54,669
I hope that you guys enjoyed the show today...

442
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:58,269
...but as all wonderful plays must come to an end,

443
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:00,669
so must this live.

444
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:04,669
But wherever you are in your life, as an actor or player

445
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:07,469
in the grand play that is existence,

446
00:24:07,469 --> 00:24:11,069
I hope you're doing well and I hope that these songs

447
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:15,369
provide some kind of happiness for you in your time of need.

448
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:17,569
Whatever that time might be, I guess.

449
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:20,069
I hope that you'll listen to PHANTOMIME.

450
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:23,069
本当に、えっと、聴いてください。本当に聴いてほしい。
Really, um, please listen to it. I really want you to listen.

451
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:26,569
PHANTOMIME、新アルバムです。
PHANTOMIME is my new album.

452
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:32,469
マジで、今まで一番最高の作品になりました。
Seriously, it has become my best work to date.

453

チェックしてください。
Please check it out.

454
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:37,869
I'd really love it if you could listen to it lots

455
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:41,269
and share it, help me share it with the world.

456
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:44,669
Help me share with the world my best piece until now.

457
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:46,569
Thank you so much everyone.

458
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,569
