2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,800
Seems time's a-wastin'
Show me what you really wanna do

3
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,500
Tonight's my turn to show ya
how obvious I can be

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,000
Sometimes it feels like you're playing
a game of me and only me

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,800
Looks so, so predictable,
they can see what I can see, go, go, go!

6
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,000
Get back! Just crash!
吐き溜めた希望を...
Get back! Just crash!
The hope I've vomited out...

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,800
Let's just crash!
飛び火していくんだ...
Let's just crash!
It's spreading like wildfire...

8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:59,300
不鮮明な情けない世界で
空白重ねた光
In a blurred and pathetic world,
light layered upon emptiness

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:05,300
脈打つ鼓動 誰にもなれない
言葉を紡いでる
A pulsing heartbeat, spinning words
that no one else can become

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:17,300
Under the black / We fall, we break
We drown in fire / Lost inside this dark desire

11
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,400
去ろう、焦がす、未来の Mercy / Mercy
Let's leave, scorching the future's Mercy / Mercy

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,500
見ろ 何もしない 最高潮の愛に
Look, at a love that does nothing
and reaches its peak

13
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,400
雲立って / Tell me what I'm not to say
What's your problem?
Clouds rise / Tell me what I'm not to say
What's your problem?

14
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,400
夜をひとり あたしが迷う
Alone in the night, I wander

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:47,300
When the thunder crashes down / When the world
caves under my pressure, there'll be no one to save

16
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:55,300
巡る巡る 運命に逆らって
出会い 思いを通わせた
Going 'round and 'round, defying fate,
we met and shared our feelings

17
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,500
These strangers I followed
with stars in their eyes

18
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Don't keep on waiting, wanting, faking
You're someone you're not reaching, longing, changing

19
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:22,000
I can't be someone else / Despite it all
my mind has become my hell / With no escape or hope

20
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,300
くらくらしちゃうでしょ
くらくらしちゃうでしょ
It'll make you dizzy, right?
It'll make you dizzy, right?

21
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,300
ほらほら遠くそう
そうでしょ Flash bang!
Look, look, it's far away
That's right, Flash bang!

22
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:43,000
In this moment / Maybe I jumped the map
Not knowing if I never try

23
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,000
昨日の夢を見るたびに
生まれた意味を考えてしまうの
Every time I dream of yesterday,
I end up thinking about the meaning of my birth

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,800
ああ 美しい 青い...
Ah, beautiful, blue...

25
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:06,000
We fall, we break / We drown in fire
Lost inside this dark desire / No love, no fate

26
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,800
What's up all you deadbeats!

27
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,300
Welcome to Disasterpiece Release...!

28
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
ようこそ！
Welcome!

29
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
たくさん楽しもうね！
Let's have a lot of fun!

30
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Let's go! Come on!

31
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,000
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

32
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Ha! You got eyes but you don't look or listen.

33
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,500
In other words, you're useless every last one of you.

34
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,200
And that's why I'm gonna send you all to Hell!

35
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,500
All of humanity!

36
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,400
全容 察した 閉じ全容 善兵 投げて
I sensed the whole picture, closed it,
threw all my pieces in

37
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,300
I'm just the type you forget,
so don't waste your time, yeah

38
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,000
契り 崩れ 賭けのチェイン 狂いそう
Somebody's gotta pay
Bonds crumble, a chain of bets,
I'm going crazy, somebody's gotta pay

39
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:01,058
Everybody's got 'em and they can't be satisfied

40
00:05:01,058 --> 00:05:02,158
Until somebody's at the bottom

41
00:05:02,158 --> 00:05:03,358
So what you think you're special

42
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:04,308
Cause you got some greed and hunger?

43
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:05,458
We ain't getting any younger

44
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,408
Let's just crash!

45
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:10,858
お前が募る場所に花は咲く
Flowers bloom where you gather

46
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:15,558
かな...
I wonder...

47
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:17,308
Let's try it!

48
00:05:17,308 --> 00:05:19,458
吐き溜めた希望
Hopes spat out

49
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,558
積み上げた苦悩
Piled up suffering

50
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:27,108
いただきケガラレたキャラコンボイ
A defiled character convoy from the top

51
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:29,258
美しき理想
Beautiful ideal

52
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:31,458
汚してく野郎
A bastard who defiles it

53
00:05:31,658 --> 00:05:37,458
誰が言いたい？ 誰が言いたい？ 誰が熱唱しても
Who wants to say it? Who wants to say it? No matter who sings passionately

54
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:40,458
この理想は無理だろうぜ
This ideal is impossible

55
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,908
誰が言いたいとしても 限界だってことさ
No matter who wants to say it, it's at its limit

56
00:05:44,258 --> 00:05:53,158
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

57
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:54,258
Come on!

58
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:59,858
世界は世界を背負ったって
Even if the world carries the world

59
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:04,258
そんなところまで出して見せろよだって
Because show me to that point

60
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:06,158
Yo, everyone's got problems

61
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,558
Everybody's got 'em and they can't be satisfied

62
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:09,958
Until somebody's at the bottom

63
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,258
So what you think you're special

64
00:06:11,258 --> 00:06:12,658
Cause you got some greed and hunger?

65
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:13,808
We ain't getting any younger

66
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:14,708
Let's just crash!

67
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:20,158
心が通う時たましいが
When hearts connect, the soul...

68
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:24,458
叫ぶ
...shouts

69
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:30,158
どぶねずみのように
Like a sewer rat

70
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:33,258
気高く生きるんだ
Living with pride

71
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:38,258
俺が通る今すぐに どけ
I'm passing through, get out of my way right now

72
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:40,558
Let's try it!

73
00:06:40,558 --> 00:06:42,558
吐き溜めた希望
Hopes spat out

74
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:44,658
積み上げた苦悩
Piled up suffering

75
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:50,158
いただきケガラレたキャラコンボイ
A defiled character convoy from the top

76
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:52,358
美しき理想
Beautiful ideal

77
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,558
汚してく野郎
A bastard who defiles it

78
00:06:54,658 --> 00:07:00,458
誰が言いたい？ 誰が言いたい？ 誰が熱唱しても
Who wants to say it? Who wants to say it? No matter who sings passionately

79
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,558
この理想は無理だろうぜ
This ideal is impossible

80
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:08,058
誰が言いたいとしても 限界だってことさ
No matter who wants to say it, it's at its limit

81
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:26,558
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

82
00:07:27,758 --> 00:07:29,858
限界だってことさ
It's at its limit

83
00:07:30,258 --> 00:07:32,108
皆さん！
Everyone!

84
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:33,658
We're just getting started!

85
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:35,458
始まったね！
It's started!

86
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:02,816
When thunder crashes down

87
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:05,816
When the world gives under pressure

88
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:08,516
there'll be no one left to save

89
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:13,516
Where is your pride, you human will to survive?

90
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:18,516
Was it just empty words for your grave?

91
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:21,816
I'll reach inside this sound

92
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:27,516
now all that remains is illusion, now decay

93
00:10:29,516 --> 00:10:32,516
Because of you, I lived this way

94
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:36,216
We're not rivals

95
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:38,216
We're not equals

96
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:40,816
We're not rivals

97
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,816
You're just confused

98
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:45,016
Lightning never strikes twice in the same spot

99
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:47,016
so go ahead and run up on me 'til you get shot

100
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:48,816
I see the weapon that you're hiding

101
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,016
come on, ready or not

102
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,016
Another life and you would never get a second thought

103
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,016
DISASTER SHOW Mori Calliope

104
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:58,016
Thinking your pride's different than mine

105
00:10:58,216 --> 00:11:02,016
Thinking I've had a sudden change of heart

106
00:11:03,516 --> 00:11:07,516
But we still gotta pretend to our friends from our enemies

107
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:10,016
Wouldn't you agree?

108
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:15,516
Forged in fires of hell, I can't betray you

109
00:11:15,816 --> 00:11:19,516
If I'm a fallen angel, what does that make you?

110
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:24,016
I'm not debasing myself to see the same view

111
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:27,016
When it's your pride on the line

112
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:30,016
no one can save you from mine

113
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:32,016
We're not rivals

114
00:11:32,216 --> 00:11:34,216
We're not equals

115
00:11:34,516 --> 00:11:36,516
We're not rivals

116
00:11:36,716 --> 00:11:38,516
We're not equals

117
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:29,516
Thank you for coming today everyone, it's over!

118
00:13:29,616 --> 00:13:31,516
It's okay, no, no, no, we're back, we're back.

119
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:34,016
Just some technical difficulties.

120
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:35,516
Staff-san, the beats!

121
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:39,016
Everyone calm down, it's fine, it's fine, we're okay.

122
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:41,516
Welcome, welcome!

123
00:13:41,716 --> 00:13:44,216
Hey, you know what? It fits in the theme of the show

124
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:46,816
that there'd be some technical issues.

125
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:49,016
So it can't be perfect, right?

126
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:51,016
But I'm looking at your comments right now

127
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:54,016
and thank you by the way to Shiori for the raid as well.

128
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:56,516
Hope the outfit reveal went super good.

129
00:13:56,616 --> 00:14:00,016
Hi Dead Beats! Hello!

130
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:02,516
We're here, we're here!

131
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,516
We're finally at the Disasterpiece venue.

132
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:09,516
And I'm reading your comments, but there might be a little bit of lag,

133
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,216
so sorry about that.

134
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:14,216
Anyway, check it out. I've got a special,

135
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:16,216
I've got my own special mic

136
00:14:16,316 --> 00:14:19,516
that is definitely what I'm using to talk and not the headset.

137
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:21,016
But check it out!

138
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:23,016
Oh, I'll show it to you closer later.

139
00:14:23,216 --> 00:14:25,516
I've got... oh, hello! Liz is here too!

140
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:28,516
Amazing Senpai, woo! Thank you.

141
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:31,516
Welcome to Disaster Show everyone.

142
00:14:31,616 --> 00:14:34,016
Disasterpiece is out at long last!

143
00:14:34,116 --> 00:14:37,016
Hooray! We did it! We finally got here.

144
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:40,516
And now, I'm gonna do some songs for you guys.

145
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:43,016
Whoa, Akaspa... I can't read it right now,

146
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:46,016
but I'll have to read them later. Thank you so much.

147
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:48,016
The new art style is so nice?

148
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:51,516
This is some unreal power, Dead Beats, unreal power.

149
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:53,016
It's stunning, isn't it?

150
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:54,816
I bet you want to get a closer look

151
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:57,816
and maybe get some screenshots of Mori Calliope's face.

152
00:14:58,016 --> 00:15:01,016
So let me show you, Staff-san is holding a special camera.

153
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,324
よろしくお願いします！ うおっ！
Please look after me! Woah!

154
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:07,424
Hey hey! Hold on, I think this is my normal hand. Oh!

155
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:11,424
Alright, I'm gonna get some good reactions for you guys.

156
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:13,024
Hold on a sec.

157
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:17,324
Here I go. Check this shit out.

158
00:15:18,024 --> 00:15:21,024
Hah!

159
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:23,724
I'm being silly.

160
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:26,524
I'm being silly 'cause I need time to chill right now.

161
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:30,224
You sound amazing, Calli! I'm doing my best, whew!

162
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:32,424
And the outfit, too!

163
00:15:32,624 --> 00:15:35,324
Look how shiny! Shiny!

164
00:15:35,724 --> 00:15:37,424
It just... it looks so good.

165
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:40,424
And my face... my face looks good too.

166
00:15:40,824 --> 00:15:44,224
Oh gosh, I'm still not used to holding the camera though,

167
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:47,324
so I'm trying to make it perfect,

168
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:50,024
but you might have to edit it later.

169
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:51,624
Hold on, no, I got this. Okay.

170
00:15:52,324 --> 00:15:54,424
RTX on.

171
00:15:54,824 --> 00:15:56,524
Very realistic.

172
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,524
I can wink. Hold on, here I go.

173
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,024
Here... wait, hold on, I got...

174
00:16:02,124 --> 00:16:03,924
I suck at this.

175
00:16:04,024 --> 00:16:07,124
That's okay, though. It's fine if it's not perfect.

176
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:10,524
I think I can wink. Check this out.

177
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:11,724
頑張れ！
Do your best!

178
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,424
Close enough!

179
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:20,524
It looks good. And look, behind us, we've got the track

180
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:22,624
from the "Let's Get It Crashed" MV.

181
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:25,824
And we've got Challenger's car behind me.

182
00:16:26,124 --> 00:16:29,424
And we've also got King's car as well.

183
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,424
Um, and then, well, you Deadbeats,

184
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:35,524
you're all on your way to the next stage, so you're not there yet.

185
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:37,424
Um, but let me show you my mic...

186
00:16:37,524 --> 00:16:40,424
マイク見せたいから。ありがとうございます。
Because I want to show the mic. Thank you very much.

187
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,124
Okay. Check it... check out the mic.

188
00:16:42,224 --> 00:16:45,324
This is the special Mori Calliope mic

189
00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:47,324
that was made special for me. Isn't it cool?

190
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:48,824
Look how sick!

191
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,424
The red and the roses... I'm obsessed.

192
00:16:52,524 --> 00:16:54,224
I'm obsessed with it.

193
00:16:54,324 --> 00:16:57,224
So, anyway, that's what's going on, Deadbeats.

194
00:16:57,324 --> 00:17:00,124
I wanted to show you the actual future of Hololive.

195
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:03,124
Well, I mean, the technology will only get better and better.

196
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,124
So, um, anyway, this is exciting.

197
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,124
You guys want to see some more songs?

198
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:08,524
Oh, also, buy the album!

199
00:17:08,624 --> 00:17:11,224
I'm all bent out of shape. I feel like MCs...

200
00:17:11,324 --> 00:17:14,524
I'm like good when it's an actual live, like in a venue,

201
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:18,424
but then if it's like this, I screw up a lot, so... oh well.

202
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:22,424
New merch? Um, not... well, I mean, this!

203
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:24,424
Oh, you're talking about the mic?

204
00:17:24,524 --> 00:17:26,524
You want the mic as merchandise?

205
00:17:26,624 --> 00:17:28,424
I'll think about it.

206
00:17:28,524 --> 00:17:30,424
Not a bad idea. I think P-san's listening to that,

207
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:33,424
so I'll have to talk to her about it later. Welcome to the future!

208
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:37,424
Anyway, Deadbeats... I gotta do a quick costume change and scene change.

209
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,424
So, let's get out of here and I'll sing some more songs

210
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:44,424
and... be up with you hither and thither...

211
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:46,424
that's probably the wrong word to use in that situation.

212
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,424
But thank you, Saps-san!

213
00:17:48,524 --> 00:17:49,424
Alright, I'll catch you guys there.

踊れ
Dance

274
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:25,584
So just how far can I go?

275
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:30,322
I think I already know

276
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:34,860
That view that I want to see

277
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,464
A place in history that's mine, I

278
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:44,403
I don't know why we're always side-by-side worlds apart

279
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:49,141
It's trial by fire, I'm fighting for a place where we can breathe

280
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:53,945
When spite takes over, I might just take it out on you

281
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:58,884
Cause you're too good to be true

282
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,722
Struggling but carrying on, I'll go where nobody has gone

283
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:08,860
I'm searching again and again and again for something only I can do

284
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:13,598
Asking why I can't be someone else

285
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:20,405
Despite it all my mind has become my hell

286
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:25,544
With no escape or hope in the dark

287
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:30,315
But still in my heart your words echo over and over

288
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:35,053
I'm finally letting go but I can't erase you

289
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:40,125
I'm following behind but I won't chase you

290
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:45,230
I'm swallowing my pride until the time that I can face you

291
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:50,135
I thought that it was love in the perfect lighting

292
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:54,539
It's never been enough but I'll keep on writing a story

293
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:59,678
That's evolving from the day that I decided I'm alone

294
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:04,616
I don't belong anywhere anymore, it was my decision

295
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:09,488
I'm gonna break down the door to your heart without your permission

296
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:14,326
There was nothing that could make me stay

297
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:19,464
Remember it like it was yesterday, hanging on every word you'd say

298
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,966
What if I'd walked away?

299
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:25,470
How can I still carry on, someday when you're finally gone

300
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:30,509
I'm searching again and again and again for something only I can do

301
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:35,013
The truth is I can't be someone else

302
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:41,353
Despite it all my mind has become my hell

303
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:46,458
With no escape or hope in the dark

304
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:51,329
But still in my heart my words echo over and over

305
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:55,767
I'm finally letting go and you can't erase me

306
00:23:55,767 --> 00:24:00,338
Cause I'm the only one that could ever replace me

307
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:05,510
Igniting every line until the time that I can face you

308
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:10,181
I thought that it was love in the perfect lighting

309
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:14,986
It's never been enough but I'll keep on writing a story

310
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:20,492
That evolved me, it's the day that I'm deciding I'm alright

311
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:25,597
So just how far can I go?

312
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:30,502
I think I already know

313
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:35,240
That view that I want to see

314
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:40,945
I still could make it in time

315
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,783
みなさん、welcome to the next stage!

Clap clap, thank you for the claps.

317
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,121
Thank you so much! What did you guys think?

318
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:53,725
And check it out, we got this... and now I'm being goofy, I'm sorry.

319
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,628
ぱちぱちぱち... thank you so much! Oh, is Oda-san here?
Clap clap clap... thank you so much! Oh, is Oda-san here?

320
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,864
Sorry if there's like, again, just lag.

321
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,740
...is very high quality machine we're using
...is a very high quality machine we're using

322
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,340
to broadcast to all of you, so

323
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,740
there might be a bit of lag.

324
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,540
But I'm happy that I can read some of your

325
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,540
comments in real time.

326
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,040
Thank you so much, you guys.

327
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,740
Makes me very happy. パチパチパチ！
Makes me very happy. *Clap clap clap!*

328
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,340
Thank you! Oh, but we might...

329
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,540
we might need to refresh the chat,

330
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,040
because now it has stopped moving.

331
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,440
Anyway, in the mean— Oh!

332
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,240
There it goes, there it goes. Oh wow,

333
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,840
I think it just exploded when Raora

334
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,240
entered the chat. Anyway.

335
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,640
Thank you so much, you guys.

336
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,440
I hope you guys have been liking the new songs.

337
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,040
Memento was one of the new songs

338
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,540
that I wrote. I wish I could go

339
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,540
into it in a longer MC

340
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,240
or talk more about it,

341
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,440
'cause there's so much I want to say about that song.

342
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,340
But it's... it's... Oh!

343
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,140
Oh! Oh! Hold on, hold on!

344
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,140
I'm frozen in... I'm frozen in place!

345
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,040
Okay... alright. We're good, we're good.

346
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,240
大丈夫。Sorry.
Everything's okay. Sorry.

347
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,340
ザ・ワールド。No problem, no problem.
The World. No problem, no problem.

348
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,340
Here, for now though, instead of going

349
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,040
into talking about the lyrics,

350
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,340
which I'll probably do during the next...

351
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,940
during the next stream,

352
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,040
we'll find some time before or after

353
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,240
I play a game, and then I'll talk about the songs.

354
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,640
Until then... Hang on, hold on a second.

355
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,040
ケンティーさんは Gold Ambivalence には
Kenty-san couldn't be here

356
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,640
来られなかったけど、
for Gold Ambivalence...

357
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,640
でもケンティーさんから学んだのは、
but you know what I've learned from Kenty-san

358
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,540
ファンサービスがすごく大事だってこと。
is that fan service is very important.

359
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,540
昔はファンサとかするの、
I used to be really like nervous

360
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,540
すごく緊張してたんだよね、
about doing some fan sa and stuff like that...

361
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,340
だって恥ずかしがり屋だからさ。
...'cause like I'm... I'm an embarrassed person.

362
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,440
でもケンティーさんはあんなに軽々と、
But, but Kenty so easily is just like...

363
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,440
「チュッチュ」ってファンにしたり、
Oh, like... "Chu chu" to like the fans...

364
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,040
ウィンクしたり、ファンサがすごく上手で、
...like wink, and like, I don't know, he's so good at the fan sa...

365
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,040
しかも全然恥ずかしがらずに。
...and like, with no shame whatsoever.

366
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,240
私もあんな風にやってみなきゃって思ったんだ。
I thought to myself, I need to try and do some of that too.

367
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,640
だから... やってみるよ。
So... I'm gonna do that.

368
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,440
チュ！
*Kiss!*

369
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,440
あまり上手くないかもだけど。チュ！
Probably not very good at it, but anyway. *Kiss!*

370
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,840
待って、始め— ああ、完璧じゃん！
Hold on, I'll start— Oh no, it's perfect!

371
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,240
ザ・ワールドが君たちのために止めてくれたから、
Because The World... The World! It stopped it for you

372
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,840
写真が撮れるよ。
so that you could get a little picture.

373
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,340
そのカメラどこ向けてんの！
Watch where you're pointing that camera!

374
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,040
ちょっと待って、怪しいとこなんか
Hold on a second, I'm not pointing it

375
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,440
向けてないよ。何言ってんの。
anywhere suspicious. What are you talking about?

376
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,640
変顔していい？
Can I do... Can I do a funny face?

377
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,340
ワアアアア！
Bwaaaah!

378
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,340
ハアアアア！
Hwaaaah!

379
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,440
あちゃー。
Oh no...

380
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,040
とにかく... この衣装、見て。
Anyway... so here's this outfit.

381
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,540
これもまたすごくクオリティ高いよね。
And it looks so high quality again.

382
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,740
ねえ、ステージに何か気づいた？
Hey, you notice something about the stage?

383
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,340
これ、Gold Ambivalence の冒頭のコインなんだ。
This is the coin from the beginning of Gold Ambivalence.

384
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,040
デッドビーツ、見て！
Dead Beats, look!

385
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,540
意味なんてないような世界で...
Imi nante nai yo na sekai de...

386
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,540
It's the... 不確かな物語に...
It's the... futashika na monogatari ni...

387
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,040
とにかく... 見てみて。ちょっと待って。
Anyway... so check it out. Hang on.

388
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,440
ところで、このステージめちゃくちゃかっこよくない？
Look at how cool the stage is, by the way.

389
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,440
ステージチェックしてる？
Are you checking out the stage?

390
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,540
あのバラ... それから月！
Look at those... the roses... the moon!

391
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,540
ユニバーサルミュージックジャパンから
It reminds me of when I debuted

392
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,840
デビューした時を思い出すなあ。
from Universal Music Japan...

393
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,240
背景に月があったんだ。あれは何だったっけ？
and I had the moon in the background of what was it?

394
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,440
デビューアルバムのどれかだったと思う。
I think it was one of my debut albums.

395
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,040
超クール。すごく立派に見えるね。ああ、わかってる。
So cool. Looking very respectable. Oh, I know.

396
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,540
言われなくても、もうわかってるよ。
You don't need to tell me. I already know.

397
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,240
もちろん。いつものようにね。できるだけ高くしてみる？
Of course. As always. Should I put it as high as possible?

398
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,640
わあ！暗闇の中で目が光ってる。
Whoa! My eyes are glowing in the darkness.

399
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,040
エフェクトはどう？
What about the effects?

400
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,240
このショーのエフェクトもすごくクールだよね。
The effects are also so cool for this show.

401
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,640
信じられない。もっとすごいステージが控えてるよ。
I can't believe it. We have some even more amazing stages coming up.

402
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,840
まだアルバムをチェックしてない人は、新曲がいっぱいだよ！
But if you guys haven't checked out the album yet, it's full of brand new songs!

403
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,440
そのうちの一曲は自分で作曲したんだ。それから全曲...
One of them I composed myself. And then all the songs...

404
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,340
私の曲の英語の歌詞は全部私が書いてる。
all the English in my songs is written by me.

405
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,540
「Cult Following」以外は、それだけかな。
Except for maybe "Cult Following", and that's it.

406
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,340
でもあれは別のアルバムだから。だから間違いなく、
But that's in a different album. So it's safe to say...

407
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,040
英語の歌詞は全部私自身のものだよ。
all the English lyrics are my own.

408
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,540
日本語の歌詞については、作詞家の方に
And then for Japanese lyrics, I basically tell

409
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,540
どんな内容にしたいか伝えて、
the lyricists what I want it to be about...

410
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,840
自分の歌詞を渡して何を書いてほしいか伝えてるんだ。
and give them like my lyrics so they know what to write about.

411
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,540
そう、だから私の考えと気持ちが詰まってる。
But yeah, so it's full of my thoughts and my feelings.

412
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,540
これ置いとこう。ずっと持ってる必要ないもんね。
I'm gonna put this away. I really don't need to keep holding this.

413
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,240
ありがとうございます。
Thank you very much.

414
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,240
そう、世界や自分の周りの世界に対する
But yeah, it's full of my thoughts and my feelings

415
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,540
考えや気持ちが詰まってる。
about the world and the world around me.

416
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,540
今回は少しダークで、少しエモーショナルかな。
And this time it's just a bit darker, a bit more emotional.

417
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,340
でも皆、私の中にたくさんの感情があるのは知ってるよね。
But you guys know that I have a lot of emotions inside of me...

418
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,540
それらに対処する最善の方法は、
and I feel like the best way to deal with those

419
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,040
世界に向けて生産的な形で出すことだと思うんだ。
is to put them out in the world in like a productive way.

420
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,540
「終電」が大好き。「終電」は、
I love "Shuuden". "Shuuden"...

421
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,540
英語で「Last Train」って意味なんだ。
"Last Train", that's what it means in Japanese.

422
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,040
あの曲についてももっと話すのが待ちきれないよ。
I can't wait to talk more about that song too.

423
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,340
あの曲もすごく思い入れがあるんだ。
That's also very close to my heart, that song.

424
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,540
もっとたくさん話したいけど、もうまとめなきゃね。
I want to say so much more but I probably need to wrap it up.

425
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,540
相変わらず最高。ありがとう、気に入ったよ。
Amazing as usual. Thank you, I dig it.

426
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,340
本当にありがとう。
Thank you so much.

427
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,040
歌詞が全部素晴らしいね。ありがとう、デッドビーツ。
The lyrics are all amazing. Thank you, Dead Beats.

428
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
みんなに... みんなに感謝してるよ。ありがとう。
I appreciate... I appreciate all of you. Thank you.

429
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,440
さて、ここでもっとやることがあるから、
Well we have... we have some more to do here,

430
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,040
いつまでも続けてられないね。
so I can't go on forever.

431
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,540
すごく長い MC になっちゃった。だから...
This is a very long MC. So...

432
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,540
また別の変身をしよう。
let's do another Henshin.

433
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
それから... 行くぞ！
And... Let's go!

434
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,040
そば立った僕は零した 消して不確かな...
Sobatta boku wa koboshita / keshite futashika na...

435
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,348
...something you can move to,

436
00:30:01,348 --> 00:30:02,448
don't look back,

437
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:03,548
look forward,

438
00:30:03,548 --> 00:30:04,448
don't look back,

439
00:30:04,448 --> 00:30:05,548
look forward,

440
00:30:05,548 --> 00:30:06,148
don't look back.

441
00:30:06,148 --> 00:30:08,748
I slipped in the foam and kept on looking
for something to bring me up,

442
00:30:08,748 --> 00:30:11,448
asking myself, no such thing as hope,
holding down a what?

443
00:30:11,448 --> 00:30:13,948
What the thing I seen in shattered pieces
more than a reach,

444
00:30:13,948 --> 00:30:16,648
it seems so much chances decreases.

445
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,448
It's the winter of cynical as I just might be,

446
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:22,048
a random still and unwritten,
I think I'm about to break free.

447
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:24,748
My limits closing around me
they're sounding less and less real,

448
00:30:24,748 --> 00:30:27,448
because my heart is beating louder
than the fear that I feel.

449
00:30:27,448 --> 00:30:30,148
My mind's already made,
not afraid of unrealistic dream,

450
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:32,748
looking for most pristine so I can walk on water.

451
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,348
Used to look for perfection, now it's progress,

452
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:37,348
every tooth paid part of progress.

453
00:30:37,348 --> 00:30:39,948
And this moment,

454
00:30:39,948 --> 00:30:42,548
maybe it's all glass,

455
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:47,848
now knowing if I never try.

456
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:50,448
Changing faces,

457
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:53,048
enveloped in moonlight,

458
00:30:53,048 --> 00:30:55,748
I can see stars now,

459
00:30:55,748 --> 00:31:00,048
running through an endless sky.

460
00:31:12,648 --> 00:31:13,748
Don't look back,

461
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:14,848
look forward,

462
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:17,448
find something you can move to,

463
00:31:17,448 --> 00:31:18,548
don't look back,

464
00:31:18,548 --> 00:31:19,648
look forward,

465
00:31:19,648 --> 00:31:22,248
don't look back.

466
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:24,948
I fight another day, these battles inside and outside,

467
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:27,548
have all that I wanted, why am I still not satisfied?

468
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:30,248
Lost taxis and street signs,
the city mirroring my mind,

469
00:31:30,248 --> 00:31:32,848
countless ways to level took forever to find.

470
00:31:32,848 --> 00:31:35,548
Yeah, the world declined me,
I was always dope but they were like "nah",

471
00:31:35,548 --> 00:31:38,148
now it's up to me to rise, take them by surprise.

472
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:40,848
My mind never slides, always riding high, thrive,

473
00:31:40,848 --> 00:31:43,448
on this lovely hate, my future's in sky.

474
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:46,148
Running all my shadows, still in worn out shoes,

475
00:31:46,148 --> 00:31:48,748
with everything to gain,
even more to give up and lose.

476
00:31:48,748 --> 00:31:51,448
This time you gotta choose,
no excuse tired of sleeping,

477
00:31:51,448 --> 00:31:54,048
gotta move and envision tomorrows
that are too good to refuse.

478
00:31:54,048 --> 00:31:56,748
Red skies waiting,

479
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,348
but I'd lost my aim,

480
00:31:59,348 --> 00:32:02,048
more things change,

481
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,648
the more they stay the same.

482
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:07,248
Burning strife and shame,

483
00:32:07,248 --> 00:32:14,048
this pain will be my strength.

484
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:18,148
And this moment,

485
00:32:18,148 --> 00:32:20,748
maybe it's all glass,

486
00:32:20,748 --> 00:32:26,148
not knowing if I never try.

487
00:32:26,148 --> 00:32:28,748
Changing faces,

488
00:32:28,748 --> 00:32:31,348
enveloped in moonlight,

489
00:32:31,348 --> 00:32:34,048
I can see stars now,

490
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,648
guiding me to find for this moment,

491
00:32:36,648 --> 00:32:39,248
we're no longer broken,

492
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:44,548
never leaving us behind.

493
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:47,248
This morning,

494
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:49,848
I wake up to soundness,

495
00:32:49,848 --> 00:32:52,548
living with resolve now,

496
00:32:52,548 --> 00:33:00,048
running with a fearless stride.

497
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:02,748
Don't look back,

498
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:03,848
look forward,

499
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,148
don't look back,

500
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:06,448
look forward,

501
00:33:06,448 --> 00:33:09,148
find something you can move to,

502
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:11,748
don't look back.

503
00:33:33,248 --> 00:33:35,848
Hello、謳った。君がダメ。
Hello, I sang. You are no good.

504
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:38,548
花咲いた、明日は雨。
Flowers bloomed, tomorrow it'll rain.

505
00:33:38,548 --> 00:33:41,248
為せば成るんだわ、惜しみない pain
Where there's a will there's a way,
unsparing pain

506
00:33:41,248 --> 00:33:44,048
Falling on and on、惜しまれど sell.
Falling on and on, though regretted, sell.

507
00:33:44,048 --> 00:33:46,548
メッセンジャーと grab hand、よもや千年前よ惚れ。
Grab hand with the messenger,
falling in love as if a thousand years ago.

508
00:33:46,548 --> 00:33:49,248
今世中、脱する砂時計 travel、trouble、capsize.
Escaping the hourglass in this life,
travel, trouble, capsize.

509
00:33:49,248 --> 00:33:51,848
喜怒哀楽、経た達成感、不変 infinity、
気にしてんだ、本当に本当に。
Emotions, the sense of achievement gained,
unchanging infinity, I'm thinking about it, truly, truly.

510
00:33:51,848 --> 00:33:54,548
上昇し、雲の上、昇天し。
Rising above the clouds, ascending.

511
00:33:54,548 --> 00:33:57,048
Underneath the blue sky,
still choosing to sing 'cause I refuse to die.

512
00:33:57,048 --> 00:33:59,848
Breathe deep and try to look past the pain,
but these flowers are watered with acid rain.

513
00:33:59,848 --> 00:34:02,548
I can't change belief that I tried and tried,
and I grieve for the scene that I left behind.

514
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:05,148
If I could find a place to rest as of mine,
that I could live with a lifetime.

515
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:16,548
Someday I'll have sung all I'm meant to say.

516
00:34:16,548 --> 00:34:18,848
Got a feeling that I'll still sing anyway.

517
00:34:22,748 --> 00:34:25,448
Sorrow、焦がする未来の mercy
Sorrow, the mercy of the burning future

518
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:28,148
Fade out、仇に死んで、再の愛に。
Fade out, dying in vain, to a second love.

519
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:33,448
焦げ付くほどの hold you are God.
To the point of scorching, hold you are God.

520
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:38,748
Hello、Hello、今宵の daydream
Hello, Hello, tonight's daydream

521
00:34:38,748 --> 00:34:41,548
Let's maintain.

522
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,556
Messenger to grab hell, you’re both so Nen you’re yo-play

523
00:35:02,556 --> 00:35:04,356
Konsechu-dasei suru na togo to travel, trouble cap the life

524
00:35:04,356 --> 00:35:06,256
Sacrifice the false cards, bloodying the cat’s out the claws

525
00:35:06,256 --> 00:35:08,856
Nobody’s ever truly what they seem

526
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,556
With the limelight gleaming to conceal the flaws

527
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:13,856
Can’t escape the scrolling, it takes a toll of me

528
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:15,556
Dead and lost still looping, holding me

529
00:35:15,556 --> 00:35:18,256
Didn’t even matter in the end that I held out

530
00:35:18,256 --> 00:35:20,256
Sorry I could never be the god I was sought to be

531
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:22,556
So to speak, annihilate fools gold

532
00:35:22,556 --> 00:35:24,056
Living out the role I was told to be

533
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:25,556
I’ll be old and free in a matter of centuries

534
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:26,556
Wondered if there was a point to me

535
00:35:26,556 --> 00:35:31,056
Was thinking for sure I’d belong on my own

536
00:35:31,056 --> 00:35:34,556
But I found a place to belong

537
00:35:34,556 --> 00:35:37,056
People I can't live without

538
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:40,056
FOLLOW ME PLEASE! DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO OKAY!

539
00:35:43,156 --> 00:35:46,556
暗闇　奏でるMy Soul nowhere
Playing in the darkness, my soul's nowhere

540
00:35:49,256 --> 00:35:53,056
溶け連ね　駆けてただ　惹き合う
Melting together, just running and attracting each other

541
00:35:55,556 --> 00:35:59,256
Hello, Hello, 今宵のEnsomnia
Hello, Hello, tonight's Ensomnia

542
00:36:00,556 --> 00:36:01,856
Let's maintain

543
00:36:02,256 --> 00:36:04,556
In a world where nothing is certain

544
00:36:04,556 --> 00:36:08,856
Except that someday we will say goodbye

545
00:36:10,056 --> 00:36:14,256
I want to keep my eyes on the sky

546
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:17,556
砂漠みたいな街 Disaster!
This desert-like city is a Disaster!

547
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:24,056
双六　加速する未来のMercy
Sugoroku, the mercy of the accelerating future

548
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:31,056
否ならぬ　信じたい再会に
Not a no, to the reunion I want to believe in

549
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:36,556
焦げ付くほどの　Hold you all day long
Burning so hot, I'll hold you all day long

550
00:36:38,856 --> 00:36:42,556
Hello, Hello, 今宵のDaydreamer
Hello, Hello, tonight's Daydreamer

551
00:36:44,256 --> 00:36:45,856
Let's maintain!

552
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:53,556
SHOUT! We're changing the game

553
00:36:53,556 --> 00:36:55,856
Masquerading the chains, what gives you the say?

554
00:36:55,856 --> 00:36:56,556
S-O-S THE FIRE!

555
00:36:56,556 --> 00:36:58,556
SHOUT! We're changing the game

556
00:36:58,556 --> 00:37:00,856
Masquerading the chains, what gives you the say?

557
00:37:00,856 --> 00:37:02,056
S-O-S THE FIRE!

558
00:37:16,556 --> 00:37:19,556
Hey, yeah, hey, hey, everyone! Whoo!

559
00:37:21,056 --> 00:37:24,556
How was that? Tenshu and Mercy.

560
00:37:24,556 --> 00:37:29,056
You know, writing that song reminded me, yes, I still can write songs...

561
00:37:29,056 --> 00:37:33,556
...that are extremely difficult to perform live. Let's go!

562
00:37:34,256 --> 00:37:36,556
Some things never change, it feels.

563
00:37:37,056 --> 00:37:40,056
But hey, how about the tech for this concert?

564
00:37:40,056 --> 00:37:44,556
Hold on, are you guys seeing this Sakura behind me? Like, the detail?

565
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:46,556
Oh, hold on. Sorry.

566
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,056
Again, the Sakura tree is very powerful.

567
00:37:49,056 --> 00:37:51,556
It's such a big item and so detailed.

568
00:37:51,556 --> 00:37:53,256
Sometimes I stop moving.

569
00:37:53,256 --> 00:37:54,856
That's okay, doesn't matter. Whoo!

570
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,056
パチパチパチ！
Batchi batchi batchi!

571
00:37:56,056 --> 00:38:00,056
That was a thousand out of ten. Nailed it. Let's go!

572
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:01,856
ありがとうございます！
Thank you very much!

573
00:38:01,856 --> 00:38:03,556
It is clean. Drink water.

574
00:38:03,556 --> 00:38:05,256
That's a really good idea.

575
00:38:05,256 --> 00:38:07,556
水、水、水。
Water, water, water.

576
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:10,556
水、水、水。
Water, water, water.

577
00:38:10,556 --> 00:38:12,556
The invisible water.

578
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:16,056
But I mean, if you guys think back to Phantomime...

579
00:38:16,056 --> 00:38:20,056
I see a lot of you guys talking about, like, "Oh, the production, the quality is so crazy!"

580
00:38:20,056 --> 00:38:23,556
It's very powerful stuff going on around here...

581
00:38:23,556 --> 00:38:26,556
...and they really knocked it out of the park with this.

582
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:28,556
I just have so much thanks to give to my staff.

583
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:32,556
Um, be sure, we have a little credit roll at the end that will play...

584
00:38:32,556 --> 00:38:35,556
...and, you know, that's my staff and big ups to them.

585
00:38:35,556 --> 00:38:37,556
But remember the Phantomime concert, you guys...

586
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:41,556
...that we did, the little mini live for the release of Phantomime, which was really cool?

587
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:46,556
That already had like the echoes of the beginning of even better quality for these shows, right?

588
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:50,056
Well, can you imagine what the next is gonna look like?

589
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:54,556
I mean, if this, if this looks like this right now...

590
00:38:54,556 --> 00:38:57,556
I mean, can you imagine where we go from here?

591
00:38:57,556 --> 00:39:00,056
I mean, it's just really exciting to think about.

592
00:39:00,056 --> 00:39:04,056
20 years from now, Dead Beats, 20 years from now, who knows?

593
00:39:04,056 --> 00:39:08,056
I probably will be as detailed as that Sakura tree...

594
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:10,556
...but don't worry, it won't be too much, it'll still feel like me.

595
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,256
I'll make sure about that.

596
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:15,556
This is already kind of toeing the line, I think...

597
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:19,556
...but I'd love to, like, move my face a little bit more and stuff like that.

598
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:22,256
It would be more dramatic if leaves were scattering around?

599
00:39:22,256 --> 00:39:23,256
That's a good point.

600
00:39:23,256 --> 00:39:25,556
However, Dead Beat, you say that, if Sakura was falling right now...

601
00:39:25,556 --> 00:39:30,556
...I think that every PC in this studio would catch on fire.

602
00:39:30,556 --> 00:39:31,556
Great idea though.

603
00:39:25,056 --> 00:39:26,556
自撮りタイム！
Selfie time!

604
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:34,556
Okay, here we go.

605
00:39:34,556 --> 00:39:36,556
Now I'm using this camera again.

606
00:39:36,556 --> 00:39:38,256
Whoa, okay.

607
00:39:38,256 --> 00:39:41,056
You guys can get... I'm backing up, I'm backing up.

608
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,556
A bit of a closer look...

609
00:39:43,556 --> 00:39:46,056
...that Sakura tree behind, that is 3D.

610
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:48,556
They're laughing, they're laughing.

611
00:39:48,556 --> 00:39:50,556
You're laughing at me! Stop it!

612
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:51,556
Stop!

613
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:56,556
Someday I'll be able to make an angry face at you, so get ready for that.

614
00:39:56,556 --> 00:39:59,556
That's another thing to look forward to, Dead Beats. Bye!

615
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,864
W-wait... making an angry face?

616
00:40:02,164 --> 00:40:03,464
Fuck you!

617
00:40:03,564 --> 00:40:04,564
Ooh! Check out my nails!

618
00:40:06,564 --> 00:40:09,164
Even cats hide their claws.

619
00:40:11,064 --> 00:40:13,564
Hey! This is a cute little screenshot too.

620
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:17,364
I heard from my P-san, my P-san showed a little piece of paper to me...

621
00:40:17,464 --> 00:40:23,064
...that said that #disastershow entered the trends in USA.

622
00:40:23,164 --> 00:40:24,464
Thank you so much for that!

623
00:40:24,564 --> 00:40:27,564
Dead Beats, keep it coming, and some folks are like...

624
00:40:27,664 --> 00:40:30,464
"Mori, I can't believe this is free!"

625
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:34,064
Of course it's free, 'cause I know that the majority of you guys bought the album...

626
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:36,564
...so it might as well be free.

627
00:40:36,664 --> 00:40:39,564
Um, and if you didn't buy it, you at least have been streaming it.

628
00:40:39,664 --> 00:40:43,064
So it just, it just feels right, I guess...

629
00:40:43,164 --> 00:40:48,064
...to do what I can to make it worth it to you guys, even more so.

630
00:40:48,164 --> 00:40:50,064
Hi! You guys remember this outfit?

631
00:40:50,864 --> 00:40:54,464
It's a little on the older side, but check it out, you guys remember, right?

632
00:40:54,564 --> 00:40:58,564
From my very first solo show, "New Underworld Order".

633
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,064
It's looking good, right? I'm looking good.

634
00:41:02,064 --> 00:41:04,564
Hi! Hi!

635
00:41:05,064 --> 00:41:07,564
Trying to get as much camera screen time as I can.

636
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:10,064
Buy the album! Buy the album! Say the Dead Beats.

637
00:41:10,164 --> 00:41:12,464
お願いします！ If you could, I'd be very happy.
Please! If you could, I'd be very happy.

638
00:41:13,264 --> 00:41:16,064
Whoa, this is kind of a cool shot with the Sakura.

639
00:41:16,164 --> 00:41:19,464
My eyes are glowing in the darkness. Hey there. Hi.

640
00:41:24,164 --> 00:41:26,564
I'll keep trying to make silly faces though.

641
00:41:26,664 --> 00:41:28,464
That's something that'll never change about me.

642
00:41:28,564 --> 00:41:30,064
This is a screenshot moment.

643
00:41:30,164 --> 00:41:33,064
Whenever it stops, it means it's a screenshot moment. Maybe.

644
00:41:34,064 --> 00:41:38,264
Anyway, it's time to move on because I still have a couple songs to sing for you guys.

645
00:41:38,364 --> 00:41:42,064
I think this one will end up being longer than "Dance Past Midnight", which is a good thing.

646
00:41:42,164 --> 00:41:44,264
I get to sing even more for you!

647
00:41:44,364 --> 00:41:46,564
What songs will they be? I wonder.

648
00:41:47,064 --> 00:41:49,064
ありがとう、スタッフさん！
Thank you, staff!

649
00:41:49,164 --> 00:41:54,064
And, uh, yeah. So, I guess it's about time that we move on to the next spot.

650
00:41:54,164 --> 00:41:56,264
Looking good.

651
00:41:56,364 --> 00:41:58,264
Thanks Dead Beats. You want to see my high kicks I've been working on?

652
00:41:58,364 --> 00:42:01,064
おいしょ！ And...
Hup! And...

653
00:42:02,464 --> 00:42:04,564
おいしょ！ My high kicks.
Hup! My high kicks.

654
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:08,064
おいしょ！ Next year I'm going to kick even higher, you'll see.
Hup! Next year I'm going to kick even higher, you'll see.

655
00:42:08,164 --> 00:42:11,264
Anyway, that's some randomness right there.

656
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:14,364
Let's go. Next... 変身！
Let's go. Next... Transformation!

657
00:42:15,564 --> 00:42:17,364
行くぞ！
Here we go!

658
00:42:30,564 --> 00:42:35,064
I put my last illusions behind...

659
00:42:35,564 --> 00:42:40,064
Still you're creeping through my thoughts tonight.

660
00:42:41,564 --> 00:42:45,064
Now I know it's so mis-skin deep...

661
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:50,064
Drawn like moths to flames inside your heat.

662
00:42:50,164 --> 00:42:54,064
Heat, heat.

663
00:42:55,264 --> 00:42:58,264
Consider myself fine, but I'm christening every line...

664
00:42:58,364 --> 00:43:00,564
...drunk on love that's not mine.

665
00:43:01,064 --> 00:43:04,264
Heaven sent you way too late, kiss of death and take the fate...

666
00:43:04,364 --> 00:43:08,064
...past lives and loaded dice, white lies and alibis.

667
00:43:08,164 --> 00:43:11,264
Fingers tracing edges of the medicine I never swallow...

668
00:43:11,364 --> 00:43:14,064
...rights don't know the enemy to fight, not in this life.

669
00:43:14,164 --> 00:43:17,064
Stolen whispers, don't ask and don't tell...

670
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:20,364
...step into my world, welcome to hell.

671
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:24,064
Sinking down in your deep black...

672
00:43:24,164 --> 00:43:26,564
We fall, we break...

673
00:43:26,664 --> 00:43:29,064
...we drown in fire.

674
00:43:29,164 --> 00:43:33,464
Lost inside this dark desire.

675
00:43:35,264 --> 00:43:38,264
No love, no faith...

676
00:43:38,364 --> 00:43:41,364
...just you and I...

677
00:43:41,464 --> 00:43:45,064
...dancing to the end of time.

678
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:48,364
Ba la la la la la la la...

679
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:55,064
Ba la la la la la la la...

680
00:43:57,264 --> 00:44:00,264
Ba la la la la la la la...

681
00:44:00,364 --> 00:44:13,264
...end of time, end of time, end of time. Ba la la la la la la la...

682
00:44:13,364 --> 00:44:17,264
I still blame myself for this haze...

683
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:22,264
...shame that overflows, it never dissipates.

684
00:44:24,364 --> 00:44:30,064
I let words unsaid rot slowly, tainted and unholy...

685
00:44:30,164 --> 00:44:33,264
...no don't say...

686
00:44:33,364 --> 00:44:38,564
Watch, wait, cold steel pressed against your neck.

687
00:44:39,164 --> 00:44:45,064
Ba la la la la la la la...

688
00:44:45,164 --> 00:44:51,264
...end of time, end of time, end of time.

689
00:44:51,364 --> 00:44:54,264
One last breath before we die...

690
00:44:54,364 --> 00:44:57,264
...the sight of you intoxicates...

691
00:44:57,364 --> 00:45:00,064
Say a prayer, pass the time to confess...

692
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,422
...us, it's a game we never plan to win

693
00:45:01,422 --> 00:45:06,072
and take us to rest, six feet under side by side

694
00:45:06,922 --> 00:45:09,222
We fall,

695
00:45:09,222 --> 00:45:10,622
we break,

696
00:45:10,622 --> 00:45:12,422
we drown in fire

697
00:45:12,722 --> 00:45:18,622
lost inside this dark desire

698
00:45:19,522 --> 00:45:22,072
No love,

699
00:45:22,072 --> 00:45:24,572
no fear,

700
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:26,622
just you and I

701
00:45:26,622 --> 00:45:29,922
dancing till the end of time

702
00:45:30,072 --> 00:45:37,122
La la la la la la...

703
00:45:37,922 --> 00:45:43,122
Ashes fall from blackened skies

704
00:45:43,322 --> 00:45:49,122
all that's left is you and I

705
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:55,622
drunk inside this love tonight

706
00:45:55,822 --> 00:45:57,122
La la la la la la...

707
00:45:57,122 --> 00:46:01,122
End of time, end of time

708
00:46:01,122 --> 00:46:07,622
End of time, end of time...

709
00:46:17,422 --> 00:46:21,122
I ain't tryna stress you, I must confess though
my heart's beating to your song

710
00:46:21,122 --> 00:46:23,622
(Oh yeah!) Thinking hurry up
Orpheus, time's a-wastin'

711
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,622
Tell me what you really wanna do!

712
00:46:25,822 --> 00:46:29,122
Another late night aimless dreaming
The bitter taste starts to call

713
00:46:29,322 --> 00:46:33,622
Still got like a million deadlines, beating red wine
my back up against the wall

714
00:46:33,822 --> 00:46:37,322
I got my headphones on, walk home alone
dragging feet like I'm born to lose

715
00:46:37,522 --> 00:46:41,622
Till somehow they're tapping along
to you-know-whose song, a melody I can't refuse

716
00:46:42,122 --> 00:46:45,922
Cause when my heart beats fast
when you look this way

717
00:46:46,122 --> 00:46:49,622
Can you see us on the stage
when you feel the same, okay?

718
00:46:49,822 --> 00:46:53,722
I know I get a little carried away, but we got
music when there aren't any words to say

719
00:46:53,922 --> 00:46:57,922
Cause when my heart beats fast when you look this way
can you see us on the stage when you feel the same?

720
00:46:58,122 --> 00:47:04,622
Now I'm in distress, you got me possessed, I might be
obsessed, so let me get a little something off my chest, look

721
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,622
I ain't tryna stress you, I must confess though
my heart's beating to your song

722
00:47:08,822 --> 00:47:11,122
(Oh yeah!) Thinking hurry up
Orpheus, time's a-wastin'

723
00:47:11,322 --> 00:47:13,322
Tell me what you really wanna do!

724
00:47:13,522 --> 00:47:17,122
Tonight it's my turn to show you how obvious I can be

725
00:47:17,322 --> 00:47:21,122
Sometimes it feels like you're playing guitar
for me and only me

726
00:47:21,322 --> 00:47:24,622
Critics so loud, so predictable
they can't see what I can see

727
00:47:24,822 --> 00:47:30,922
Gonna wind up a star, got me dancing in the dark!

728
00:47:31,122 --> 00:47:35,122
This-this-this got me feeling fond
and I wonder if it's enough

729
00:47:35,322 --> 00:47:38,922
Cause I'm not lying when I'm implying
you're all that I've been thinking of

730
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:42,622
Maybe they'll call me delusional
maybe this could be real love

731
00:47:42,822 --> 00:47:47,422
Give me one chance and I'll take, dance the night away!

732
00:47:47,622 --> 00:47:51,122
Now it's a game that I played before

733
00:47:51,322 --> 00:47:55,122
But with the way the scene changed
there is nothing you can blame me for

734
00:47:55,322 --> 00:47:59,122
I'm talking TV screens, magazines, seen you in a
couple dreams, pictures up on every patio wall in floor

735
00:47:59,322 --> 00:48:02,922
Always talking bout no time to desire a love
so why'd you paint your nails up in my favorite color?

736
00:48:03,122 --> 00:48:06,922
I got an attitude just when it comes to you
see reality is kind of slipping out of view

737
00:48:07,122 --> 00:48:10,622
Never lost in the groove of somebody new
if it's devotion you're after I'm staying true

738
00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:14,422
So are you noticing me noticing you noticing me?
No disillusion but there's not a lot of guarantee

739
00:48:14,622 --> 00:48:18,322
Cause when my heart beats fast when you look this way
can you see us on the stage when you feel the same?

740
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:22,122
You're strumming next to me and I'm in ecstasy
and for the rest of the week I'm depression free

741
00:48:22,322 --> 00:48:25,922
I ain't tryna stress you, I must confess though
my heart's beating to your song

742
00:48:26,122 --> 00:48:28,322
(Oh yeah!) Thinking hurry up
Orpheus, time's a-wastin'

743
00:48:28,522 --> 00:48:30,622
Tell me what you really wanna do!

744
00:48:30,822 --> 00:48:34,322
Tonight it's my turn to show you how obvious I can be

745
00:48:34,522 --> 00:48:38,322
So just as long as you keep playing that guitar!

746
00:48:38,522 --> 00:48:41,922
Critics so loud, so predictable
they can't see what I can see

747
00:48:42,122 --> 00:48:48,122
Gonna wind up a star, got me dancing in the dark!

748
00:48:48,322 --> 00:48:52,322
This-this-this got me feeling fond
and I wonder if it's enough

749
00:48:52,522 --> 00:48:56,122
Cause I'm not lying when I'm implying
you're all that I've been thinking of

750
00:48:56,322 --> 00:48:59,922
Maybe they'll call me delusional
maybe this could be real love

751
00:49:00,122 --> 00:49:04,622
Give me one chance and I'll take, dance the night away!

752
00:49:04,822 --> 00:49:06,622
Hey, hey, come on!

753
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:10,322
So let's blow this joint and if the feeling's right
then we can make a little music of our own tonight!

754
00:49:10,522 --> 00:49:14,622
Come on! Hey, hey! Why you walking away? I got a lot
to say, guess I'll save it for the next one!

755
00:49:14,822 --> 00:49:18,622
I ain't tryna stress you, I must confess though
my heart's beating to our song

756
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:21,622
So hear me out Orpheus, thinking next time
I'll show you what I really wanna do!

757
00:49:35,122 --> 00:49:39,622
I'm back Dead Beats! Where'd the cats go? (laugh)

758
00:49:39,922 --> 00:49:43,122
Hey wait a minute, where'd the weird cats at?

759
00:49:44,122 --> 00:49:46,622
They were just here a second ago.

760
00:49:46,822 --> 00:49:50,622
Dead Beats, check out what I can do. Hold on.
Get ready. Are you ready? Check it out.

761
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:58,622
I'm obsessed with how this dress moves. Dead Beats!
I mean, look at this. Let me... let me... let me just...

762
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,280
Maybe I should back up a little bit.

763
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,080
Look at how it moves.

764
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,580
Ooo, so scandalous. Ah, don't look!

765
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,880
The physics are crazy.

766
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,580
How about those weird cats though? Doing the dance.

767
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,580
It was so cute. The creature, nice moves, thank you.

768
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,580
Thank you, Dead Beats.

769
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,880
Oh, that was fun. That was fun, Dead Beats.

770
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,580
I had such a good time with you guys today.

771
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,580
Actually, I mentioned to you guys my family?

772
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,080
My family came to glorious Nippon and actually...
My family came to glorious Japan and actually...

773
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,480
...we kind of celebrated the release together.

774
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,380
I was like, you know, sneaking around some places
that were selling the album...

775
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,580
...and then hearing my own music
blasting on the speakers.

776
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,580
They were playing Orpheus,
they were playing Golden Balance,

777
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,580
they were playing Let's Just Crash.

778
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,580
And for the first time ever, Dead Beats,

779
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:54,080
walking around the store, I didn't feel like...
embarrassed.

780
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,580
Which is a step in the right direction.

781
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,580
I feel like I've been getting better, Dead Beats.

782
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,880
I hope it was fun. It was so fun.

783
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,580
Dead Beats, I can't even explain...

784
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,580
...being able to be so proud and say,

785
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,580
"Look, that's my thing.
They're playing my song on the speaker."

786
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,880
It's so cool.
I mean, I went to karaoke with my little sister.

787
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,580
She told me that "Die for You"
was her favorite song of mine

788
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,880
and "MERA MERA", which made me very happy.

789
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,580
Those are little sister Reaper's favorites

790
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,580
and I sang it for her and her friends

791
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,580
because they really wanted to hear
and they're like, "Whoa, free concert!"

792
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,580
It was really cool.

793
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,580
Um, so yeah, there was that.
What else did I want to talk about?

794
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,580
I don't know, I feel like even today
with today's show,

795
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,580
I feel like I'm getting more confident
to do more things with my voice.

796
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,080
And I can do more things with my voice.

797
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,580
It's still a little rough and unpolished,
but like, that's the point of Disasterpiece in general, right?

798
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,580
I'm working towards my masterpiece and maybe...

799
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,080
...it will take some time to get things exactly
the way that I want, maybe I'll never get there, you know?

800
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,580
But I'm doing more with my voice

801
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,580
and even though it's new stuff and it needs polishing,
I'm really happy with it.

802
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,580
What's my favorite song, asks the Dead Beats?

803
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,580
Oh, I don't know, I like them for different reasons.

804
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,580
The one that maybe I'm proudest of
is maybe "Rivals and Equals"

805
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,580
because I still listen to that and I'm like,
"Yeah, that's really good."

806
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,580
But then I also really like "SHU-EN"
for the lyrics as well,

807
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,580
probably my favorite lyrics
I've written in a long time.

808
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,580
So, yeah. That's right,

809
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,580
that Dead Beat says it's about the journey. Exactly.

810
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,080
I'm running out of time here so let me get this
jidori camera real quick. Hold up.
I'm running out of time here so let me get this
selfie camera real quick. Hold up.

811
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,580
Ah, yes. My eyes are glowing in the dark right now

812
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,580
because we're in a dark area.

813
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,080
But now I'm going to show you the skirt move,
let's get on the red.

814
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,580
Gotta get on the red.
Okay, I'm moving my chest piece,

815
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,580
which is myself, to the red. Look at the skirt.

816
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,580
It's kind of hard to see. Sorry.

817
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,080
Sorry. Doing my best over here.

818
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,580
Uh, maybe it's better to view from the other side.

819
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,580
So look, there's the—this is the stage

820
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,580
from "Die for You" MV.

821
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,080
And then you can see if we look this way,
it's darkness,

822
00:52:55,180 --> 00:53:00,580
and then if we look this way, it's darkness.

823
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,580
But it's still really cool. Whoa, what's that?

824
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,080
It kind of looks like the wall
that maybe leads to the hospital?

825
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,580
I don't know.

826
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,580
Respectfully, of course. Peace.

827
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,580
Peace. Peace.

828
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,580
I'll make it work. Hi. Hello.

829
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:22,580
It is I, Mori Calliope, and I just released
a new album.

830
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,580
It's my best work so far. And in Japan,

831
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:31,580
we got number one album on iTunes ranking.
Yay! For alternative, for alternative music.

832
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,580
So let's see how much further we can push.

833
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,080
Last time I checked in US it was climbing,

834
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:41,580
it was getting high up, but you know
there's a lot of stiff competition there.

835
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,580
So it's all good, it's all good if we don't
reach number one that's fine.

836
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,580
But I'd love for you guys to keep pushing
for me if you would like to.

837
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:55,580
Spread the word and keep listening
in all your favorite places. Keep enjoying the album.

838
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,080
And I will keep making—I'll keep doing stuff
that only I can do.

839
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,580
Like writing Mori Calliope lyrics. So, yeah.

840
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,580
I guess that's about it. I want to give a
special thanks to Dead Beats

841
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,080
and to Staff-san.

842
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,580
いつもありがとうございます。
Always, thank you very much.

843
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,580
My staff is the best. Please look at the credits
so you know who to say thank you to.

844
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,080
Dead Beats, and yeah, post it everywhere.
Thank you, thank you Dead Beats.

845
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:26,580
I'm reading y'all's comments to eat the camera?
I think that's a bad idea.

846
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,580
I think they'll get mad at me if I do that.
I think it's going to break things.

847
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,080
Anyway, that's the end of the jidori camera.
Anyway, that's the end of the selfie camera.

848
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,080
Anyway, we are back here. So, I guess that's—

849
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,580
Oh, like I said, I'm using a headset.

850
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,580
No, no, no. Really, microphone. Trust, trust.

851
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,580
But you know, with the technical stuff,
there's always a little bit of magic involved, right?

852
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,580
In order to get the level of quality
that we've got. So...

853
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,580
...but thank you guys always for cheering
for me and being excited about my work.

854
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,580
Now there is no encore because life has
no encore. So sorry about that.

855
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,080
I think there are a lot of songs
you guys want to hear me sing.

856
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,388
...singing them soon for you, on my streams.

857
00:55:02,388 --> 00:55:04,600
So tune into my streams...

858
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,388
...and my- my karaoke streams...

859
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,613
...and streams where I'm singing my stuff...

860
00:55:09,613 --> 00:55:11,888
...and, uh, future shows.

861
00:55:11,888 --> 00:55:14,288
If there's a song that you really want to hear,

862
00:55:14,288 --> 00:55:18,499
like I know a lot of you probably want to hear
"SHŪTEN", for example.

863
00:55:18,499 --> 00:55:20,988
So if you want to hear it,

864
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:23,421
you've got to stay tuned and come to the next one.

865
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:26,243
Like I said, life has no encore.

866
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:29,028
So, what I want you to do now is...

867
00:55:29,028 --> 00:55:30,888
...just rewatch the live.

868
00:55:30,888 --> 00:55:32,788
And then go listen to the music.

869
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:34,788

870
00:55:34,788 --> 00:55:37,388

00:55:37,388 --> 00:55:39,888
Thank you for supporting what I do.

872
00:55:39,888 --> 00:55:41,588
I'm strange,

873
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,288
but you know, this is really fun.

874
00:55:44,288 --> 00:55:47,088
I'm glad I get to do this every day.

875
00:55:47,088 --> 00:55:50,088
And I put my whole heart into the new release.

876
00:55:50,088 --> 00:55:52,888
So... I'll see you guys tomorrow.

877
00:55:52,888 --> 00:55:54,888
We're playing a game.

878
00:55:54,888 --> 00:55:57,388
There's- there's a game stream tomorrow.

879
00:55:57,388 --> 00:55:59,388
See you guys around.

880
00:55:59,388 --> 00:56:01,388
Thanks again everyone!

881
00:56:01,388 --> 00:56:03,499
I'm your Mori, hope you'll remember me.

13. Sepia feat. TOOBOE

958
01:02:10,496 --> 01:02:13,596
夢を見るたび
Every time I dream

959
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:17,596
生まれた意味を考えてしまうの
I end up thinking about the reason I was born

960
01:02:17,596 --> 01:02:21,096
ああ美しき青い...
Ah, the beautiful blue...

14. Die For You feat. ARTMS

962
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,196
We fall.

963
01:02:23,196 --> 01:02:24,496
We break.

964
01:02:24,496 --> 01:02:27,096
We're drown in fire.

965
01:02:27,096 --> 01:02:30,596
Lost inside this dark desire.

966
01:02:30,596 --> 01:02:33,496
No love, no fate, just...
