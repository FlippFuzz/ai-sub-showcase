00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:48,300
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

5
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,300
Hey Dead Beats! What's up!

6
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,500
Wooooo!

7
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Happy birthday, happy birthday to me!

8
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,400
Hey guys, what's up? Thank you very much

9
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,700
for coming to my very first ever 3D live concert!

10
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,700
I see all you Dead Beats in chat going wild right now. What is up!

11
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,600
疲れてる... バイバイ！
I'm tired... bye bye!

12
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,900
I'm kidding, I'm kidding! It's a joke, it's a joke!

13
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,400
No, we're here to... we're here to celebrate!

14
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Why are we starting off in this room? I don't know,

15
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,000
maybe because I'm nervous as hell

16
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,700
and I want to talk to my friends.

17
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,900
I want to talk to my friends.

18
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,500
友達と一緒に話したいよ。
I want to talk with my friends.

19
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,800
緊張してるからね。
Because I'm nervous.

20
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,600
Because I'm nervous, I'm so... I'm so nervous.

21
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,700
So I thought, I thought... why not do a little

22
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,500
fun game with my friends who have been with me

23
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,800
since the beginning, and afterward,

24
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,400
new friends too that I've made along the way.

25
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,300
Why don't we play a game or something?

26
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,600
So I can calm down before this big concert.

27
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,600
What do you guys think? Is that okay?

28
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,800
Is that okay, Dead Beats?

29
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,400
“Happy birthday, Daddy, calm down now!”

30
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,400
Now? I refuse!

31
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,100
You watch yourself, mister. You watch your...

32
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,200
watch yourself, I'm looking at you.

33
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,200
Don't you tell me to calm down, I'm too excited!

34
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,400
“Dad needs a workout.” I do need to go back to the gym.

35
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,100
But you know what? After today, after today,

36
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,700
I'm gonna be extra strong,

37
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,700
ムキムキ！
and ripped!

38
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,900
Yeah, especially after today's game.

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,400
Today's game is gonna require some 3D movement.

40
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,900
I thought, hey, why not, we're 3D today.

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,400
So let's... let's do some things in 3D.

42
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,400
Let's do some actions. And maybe, I don't know,

43
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,700
have my friends try to guess what I'm doing.

44
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,300
Maybe that would be cool.

45
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,300
So anyway, that's what I thought. So...

46
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Let's enjoy a game of charades,

47
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,400
charades, with my friends in HoloEN.

48
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,300
And I have some friends from ID joining,

49
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,000
and also a friend from JP will be here as well.

50
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,400
So let's get the party started! Let's start!

51
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,000
始まります！
Let's begin!

52
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:01,353
Charades game.

53
00:05:01,353 --> 00:05:02,133
Let's do it.

54
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,233
We've got two different groups of people.

55
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,153
Just so you guys know, we had to split them up.

56
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:08,533
Too many cool friends. So...

57
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,533
Let's see if we can get them in here.

58
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:11,833
Yeah, yeah, yeah, here we go.

59
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,333
Here we go, here we go.

60
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:15,533
Oh, who's it gonna be? Who's it gonna be?

61
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,433
Who's gonna be joining us?

62
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:22,533
By the way, tweet at the hashtag if you want, it's right here.

63
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:24,433
I want to see your screenshots.

64
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:26,733
Please, show me your screenshots.

65
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,933
Okay, everyone, come in!

66
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:34,233
From the first group, please come here.

67
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:35,833
Wah! Hello!

68
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,333
I heard a wah.

69
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,433
Happy Birthday! / Congratulations!

70
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:41,833
I hear my friends.

71
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:46,333
So many friends!

72
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,233
You're so beautiful!

73
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:50,133
No, stop! I'm embarrassed.

74
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:53,333
I'm embarrassed! Hazukashii!
I'm embarrassed! I'm embarrassed!

75
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:58,333
You're so cute!

76
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,633
I'm embarrassed.

77
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:05,133
I have my friends here today. We've got Sana, IRyS, Bae, Ina and Lui-chan in group number one.

78
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:06,633
Hello guys!

79
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,533
Hello!

80
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:12,733
Can I get your jiko shoukai first so everyone knows who you are?
Can I get your self-introductions first so everyone knows who you are?

81
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:14,333
Congratulations! Thank you, I'm so happy.

82
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:17,733
Please, first jiko shoukai.
Please, first self-introduction.

No, stop! Stop!

85
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,533
Stop it! Stop!

86
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,433
やめて！
Stop it!

87
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:29,333
Man...

88
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,533
No, you don't get to look at them.

89
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,833
So cute! I'm gonna die!

90
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,033
She can't! She can't!

91
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:45,033
ボコボコにしてやるぞ！
I'm gonna beat you up!

92
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:46,333
Oh, thank you.

93
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,033
ボコボコに... Thank you, thank you.
Beat you up... Thank you, thank you.

94
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,533
ヤンキーだから...
Because she's a delinquent...

95
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:52,333
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's doing it.

96
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,033
Thank you, Pon-zombie, for the words.

97
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,733
Thank you, everyone!

98
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:59,233
Hey!

99
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:00,633
Oof.

100
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,533
That wasn't part of the game.

101
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:04,133
That wasn't part of the game.

102
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:08,133
Before we start the game, though, can you introduce yourselves, please? From Sana.

103
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:09,133
Sana.

104
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:11,833
Oh, yes! It's Sana Tsukumo...

105
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,633
...from Hololive EN Council!

106
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:17,033
I am a major Calliope Mori fan!

107
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:19,433
Not your space, dude? What are you talking about?

108
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:21,033
Oi, oi!

109
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,533
Thank you, Sana, you're so sweet. How about IRyS?

110
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:26,533
Hi-RyS! It's IRyS...

111
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:30,233
...Hololive EN Project HOPE, VSinger/VTuber...

112
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:34,033
...and I'm so excited for Calli's 3D debut!

113
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:40,033
And also, Calli's number one fan in Japan! Yeah!

114
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:42,333
Hey, hold on a minute! Thank you.

115
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,033
I see, I see.

116
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:46,833
That makes sense.

117
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:48,433
I love you.

118
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:51,433
If I could really properly make a heart, I would right now, but...

119
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:52,533
...it's a little difficult.

120
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:53,633
Anyway...

121
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:56,233
Close enough. You get the message.

122
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:58,833
Thank you, IRyS. How about... how about my little sister?

123
00:07:58,833 --> 00:07:59,833
Lil' sis?

124
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,333
What's up? It's me!

125
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,233
Hakos Baelz! I have infiltrated!

126
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,633
I am her big sister, guys!

127
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,733
It's her birthday, and I wanted to come say hi.

128
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:12,133
And, oh yeah, I'm from Holo Council. I'm not leaving without a signature...

129
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,533
...on the boob. Okay?

130
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:15,533
Okay. You'll get one.

131
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,633
You're still bringing up the boob? Okay.

132
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:20,133
Oh my gosh.

133
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,533
You'll get one, you silly freaking rat.

134
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:25,833
I'll take a signature on my leg, on my leg please.

135
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,733
Is that what you want? You want a signature?

136
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:28,533
Yes!

137
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:33,333
Oh! Thank you! Beautiful!

138
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,433
It's up to you where I sign, so...

139
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:38,233
Never washing that part of my body ever again. No, never.

140
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:41,233
How about... how about our favorite taco?

141
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:43,133
Ina, you want to introduce yourself?

142
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:45,033
WAH!

143
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:47,533
Good morning, afternoon, evening! It's Ninomae Ina'nis...

144
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:50,033
...from Hololive English -Myth-!

145
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:52,833
The proudest, proudest tentacultist of Calli!

146
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,533
I'm so proud of Calli! Happy Birthday!

147
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:58,433
WAH!

148
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:00,633
I love you, Ina! Thank you for coming today.

149
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:01,933
I'm so happy.

150
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:04,333
Man, you know I love you, dude.

151
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,433
Gosh dang it, when are we gonna be on the same stage, right?

152
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:08,533
Gah!

153
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,733
I want a boco-boco fight in the face. Boco-boco.
I want a beating-up fight in the face. Beat up.

154
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:16,833
And then, who do we have last? We have my favorite kohai.
And then, who do we have last? We have my favorite junior.

155
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:21,033
お、知ってるね？
Oh, she knows, right?

156
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,333
待ったかね？
Did you wait?

157
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,533
Hi, I am Takane Lui...

158
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,433
...from the secret society HoloX!

159
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:33,333
Yeah! You're so cute every day.

160
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:37,033
But, you are so cute more than usual!

161
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:41,033
ルイちゃん、大好き！大好き！
Lui-chan, I love you! I love you!

162
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:43,233
Happy Birthday!

00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,433
ルイちゃんも可愛い。来てくれてありがとう。
Lui-chan is cute too. Thank you for coming.

165
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:49,833
Thank you for coming.

166
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:56,633
じゃ、shall we start the game?
Well, shall we start the game?

167
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:58,533
Yay! Let's go!

168
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,033
頑張ります！
I'll do my best!

169
00:10:00,545 --> 00:10:01,345
Okay, let's go!

170
00:10:01,345 --> 00:10:02,545
First word!

171
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:08,245
Okay, the audience can see, and I can see, but the girls can't see the word.

172
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:10,045
Okay, so they're going to guess.

173
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:11,845
Guess me. Okay.

174
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,545
All right, here's number one.

175
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:16,145
忍者 (ninja)
Ninja

176
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:19,545
Oh no... how am I supposed to... okay, hold on.

177
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:23,145
Karate?

178
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:24,045
Is that karate?

179
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:25,445
Martial arts?

180
00:10:25,445 --> 00:10:26,945
Hiding?

181
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:28,045
Ninja!

182
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,245
Ninja! Ninja run!

183
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,545
Yes! You got it! I'm a ninja!

184
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:35,045
Once I pulled out the Naruto run, you guys knew.

185
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:37,345
You guys knew I'm a ninja.

186
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:47,345
And don't bring up Iroha-chan in my chat, any of you!

187
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:48,845
J-chat will ban you.

188
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:51,345
She will ban you. We don't do that here.

189
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:52,545
She's a samurai!

190
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:55,345
Yes, Iroha-chan is a samurai.

191
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:57,845
Not a ninja. Not ninja, okay?

192
00:10:58,545 --> 00:11:00,045
Please remember. Okay!

193
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:02,545
Now, next word! Let's go!

194
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:06,045
IRyS

195
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:08,545
Oh no... okay, this is going to be kind of hard.

196
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:15,545
Cartwheel?

197
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,045
Levitation?

198
00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:22,745
Singing?

199
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:24,045
Opera singer?

200
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:26,545
Hold on, I'm trying to find a way to...

201
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:29,545
Okay, I hope I don't get in trouble for this.

202
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:31,545
They're going to beat the shit out of me if I get in trouble for this.

203
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:34,045
Floating! Levitation!

204
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:42,345
Titanic?

205
00:11:44,145 --> 00:11:45,345
IRyS?

206
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:46,545
Descending?

207
00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:48,045
That's right, that's right! You got it!

208
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:50,045
It's IRyS!

209
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:52,545
It's supposed to be IRyS! I'm singing...

210
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:55,545
...and I'm descending.

211
00:11:56,545 --> 00:11:59,045
I tried to get on like a swivel chair...

212
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:02,545
...but then the chair started moving around, I was like "shit, I'm getting in trouble."

213
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:08,845
I didn't know descending was that much of a big image.

214
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:11,845
I mean, yeah, you did descend three times, IRyS.

215
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:13,345
That's true, three times.

216
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:16,845
Three times! I had to climb up on something to descend.

217
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:20,545
Well, that's what I figured out about midway through.

218
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:23,045
And I was like, "this isn't going to work."

219
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:25,045
But yeah, nice job!

220
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:28,045
All right, the last question mark, last question mark.

221
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:30,045
Question... maybe it's question.

222
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:32,345
It's supposed to be hard, so let's go!

223
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,545
大盛りラーメンを食べる人
(Someone Eating a Large Bowl of Ramen)
Someone Eating a Large Bowl of Ramen

224
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,545
Oh no... how... okay, hold on.

225
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:42,045
A circle?

226
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:43,045
Swimming?

227
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:44,245
Or eating?

228
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:46,045
Eating... eating a bowl?

229
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:48,345
Person at an eating contest?

230
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:55,445
Izakaya?

231
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:56,845
Nomikai?
Drinking party?

232
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:06,045
Slurping soup! Something soup!

233
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:07,545
Slurping! Ramen!

234
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:11,545
Person eating giant ramen!

235
00:13:11,545 --> 00:13:13,545
That's right! Yes!

236
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:17,345
Someone eating a large bowl of ramen! There you go!

237
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:22,545
Nice job! I was worried about that one.

238
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:25,545
I didn't know if you'd get the first part...

239
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:30,045
...but I think I illustrated the large bowl with my impeccable 3D tracking.

240
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:33,545
やった! (Yatta!) Nice job. Wow, you guys are smart!
Hooray! Nice job. Wow, you guys are smart!

241
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:38,245
We are smart!

242
00:13:38,245 --> 00:13:41,045
You guys blasted through those three so easy.

243
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:46,045
We should do this more often when everybody gets a chance to be in 3D someday.

244
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:48,045
Charades!

245
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:51,045
Charades party with everyone, yeah!

246
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:57,545
Please, someday... think about how crazy that would be.

247
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:02,045
If that was what we did just now and it was so hilarious...

248
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:04,545
...imagine all of us together!

249
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,545
約束です。(Yakusoku desu.)
It's a promise.

250
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:12,345
約束です！ (Yakusoku desu!) Promise me!
It's a promise! Promise me!

251
00:14:12,345 --> 00:14:14,345
Pinky promise!

252
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:18,545
I'll drink a thousand needles.

253
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:21,545
Oh wow, please don't hurt yourself!

254
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:27,545
Anyway, I'll see you guys later. Thank you so much for coming!

255
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:30,545
Thank you! Bye!

256
00:14:30,545 --> 00:14:35,045
またね！ (Mata ne!) Bye bye!
See you! Bye bye!

257
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:38,545
Oh man, it's so nice to have my friends.

258
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,545
But guess what? They're not the only guests that came today.

259
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:44,245
No no, we have several more guests...

260
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:47,045
...that will be joining us in the next group.

261
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:49,045
Why don't you ladies come on in?

262
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:51,045
Come here, come here!

263
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:02,057
Yay! Oh my god!

264
00:15:02,157 --> 00:15:03,457
Oh, jump more? Okay!

265
00:15:03,557 --> 00:15:07,457
Yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay!

266
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:09,557
Save your energy, Ollie! Ollie!

267
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:11,757
No, you just want to see them bounce!

268
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:14,357
Kiara's giving me the good idol advice.

269
00:15:14,457 --> 00:15:16,857
She knows what I need to be doing right now. Sorry, let me calm down.

270
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:20,657
Yeah, save your energy. You have a whole performance ahead of you, right?

271
00:15:20,757 --> 00:15:23,157
Yes, you are right. Thank you.

272
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:24,457
There you go.

273
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,557
Okay. Calm.

274
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,057
Discomposed. There we go.

275
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:30,357
Big breath, big breath. Breathe in...

276
00:15:30,457 --> 00:15:32,457
Oh, big breath. Breathe out.

277
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,057
もっと！もっと！
More! More!

278
00:15:34,157 --> 00:15:37,057
Breathe in... breathe out.

279
00:15:37,157 --> 00:15:41,257
Okay. Be zen. Okay. We're fine. We're fine now.

280
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:44,257
Okay, who do we have here today?

281
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:48,357
Oh my gosh, some of my favorite... some of my favorite ladies in the whole world.

282
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:50,457
Oh my goodness, thank you so much for coming today.

283
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:55,057
We have both ID and of course EN Myth being represented here.

284
00:15:55,157 --> 00:15:59,457
Please introduce yourselves, first starting from Reine, my fishing buddy.

285
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:04,557
Yay! Attention please, I'm Pavolia Reine from Hololive ID Generation 2,

286
00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:08,757
Calli's fishing buddy, also a big fan!

287
00:16:09,357 --> 00:16:10,557
Everybody's a fan.

288
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:16,857
Everybody's suddenly... well, I know you guys have always been supporting me, so thanks. I appreciate it.

289
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:20,557
Thank you my sweet fishing buddy. Love you so much, Reine.

290
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:29,557
Dang. And how about... how about... how about my Apex buddy for the two times I've ever played Apex?

291
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:34,657
We've got K-K-K-K-Kureiji Ollie! Did I do it correctly?

292
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:38,257
You did it so well! Yes! はい、こんばんは！
You did it so well! Yes! Hi, good evening!

294
00:16:42,657 --> 00:16:52,557
Calliou-senpai's wife/daughter/mother-in-law. Our relationship is a little bit foggy here, but good to be here!

295
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:58,557
Eh? Hold on, I didn't get the memo for the... wait, did you say wife? Wife? Hmm?

296
00:16:59,057 --> 00:17:00,357
You proposed to me!

297
00:17:00,457 --> 00:17:02,557
Yeah, but you tricked me!

298
00:17:03,057 --> 00:17:07,557
It doesn't count. Oh, you guys! I've been tricked by Ollie.

299
00:17:07,657 --> 00:17:09,857
Oi, oi, oi, Ollie, you watch yourself.

300
00:17:10,057 --> 00:17:16,557
Next up, we've got Holo EN's number one detective Amelia Watson. Introduce yourself!

301
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:20,057
Amelia Watson! Hi Calli! Hello everybody!

302
00:17:20,157 --> 00:17:25,057
I'm Hololive Detective Amelia Watson. こんにちワトソン！
I'm Hololive Detective Amelia Watson. Konnichi-Watson!

303
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:30,057
I'm so happy to be here, Calli. I'm so proud of you. You look so beautiful. Happy Birthday!

304
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:35,557
Watson, thank you so much. I appreciate that. Oh man, I'm so glad I get to do 3D stuff.

305
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:41,557
You're also doing really awesome 3D stuff too, so I hope we get to do some fun stuff in the future. やった！
You're also doing really awesome 3D stuff too, so I hope we get to do some fun stuff in the future. Yatta!

306
00:17:41,657 --> 00:17:43,057
I can't wait. I can't wait. Let's do it!

307
00:17:43,157 --> 00:17:51,057
Yeah! And we can't forget about my idol mentor, apparently. Takanashi Kiara! Tenchou!

308
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:57,857
Hey! Ki-ki-ri-ki! I'm Hololive English's Phoenix and KFP owner, Takanashi Kiara!

309
00:17:57,957 --> 00:18:07,557
And I am apparently a pro for charades because I got the testing prompt within one second.

310
00:18:07,657 --> 00:18:13,557
Oh my god, that is true. That is true. In the beginning there, you immediately knew.

311
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:18,557
But that was something... that was something that you like know well. You knew that I was pretending to be an idol.

312
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:24,057
Hold on, that was... that's not because of that. I'm just really good at charades. I'll prove that, Calli.

313
00:18:24,157 --> 00:18:32,057
But it's also... it's also because you are just really, really good at showing those moves, expressing yourself, right?

314
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:37,057
I have too much fun. I have too much fun in 3D. It's like all of a sudden I see myself like on the screen and I'm like,

315
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:41,557
Oh man, I want to jump... I won't jump. I won't jump. I'm gonna stay calm.

316
00:18:41,657 --> 00:18:44,257
Please jump! Please jump! Please jump!

317
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:47,857
Ollie! Ollie! Don't tell your Senpai what to do!

318
00:18:47,957 --> 00:18:51,057
Sorry Ollie, I can't do that. I do gotta save my energy.

319
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:54,057
Well, shall we begin the game then? Let's go!

320
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:55,557
Yeah! Let's go!

321
00:18:56,057 --> 00:19:03,557
Alright, first word. Here we go. First word... Oh no. How am I... Okay. Here we go.

322
00:18:57,957 --> 00:19:59,257
寿司職人
Sushi Master

323
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:06,557
Oh! Oh! Washing your hair?

324
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:10,557
Making... huh? Pizza? Horse riding?

325
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:12,557
Oh, you're frying your hair!

326
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:14,557
No!

327
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:18,057
Spaghetti? You're cooking? Playing the piano?

328
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,057
No, xylophone? No, drum? What?

329
00:19:21,557 --> 00:19:24,557
It's like you're... you're tying your hair and then you're eating.

330
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:26,557
Cooking! Cooking!

331
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:27,557
Close!

332
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:30,057
Making pizza! Making ramen!

333
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:37,557
You're tying your hair so like the hair doesn't go... a chef! At a restaurant!

334
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:42,557
KFP restaurant! Making dough! Making bread!

335
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:49,057
Okay, okay. Watch this. First... Oh yes, that's it! You got it, Watson! You got it!

336
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:50,057
Sushi master!

337
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:52,557
Sushi master! I'm the sushi master.

338
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:56,557
I guess... I guess my sushi rolling technique, top tier.

339
00:19:56,657 --> 00:19:58,557
Why did you tuck your hands behind your head?

340
00:19:58,657 --> 00:19:59,257
Because I was... you know how...

341
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:30,194
寿司職人
Sushi Master

342
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:03,569
...sushi chefs like maybe have like a little
cooking hat or bandana or something?

343
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,169
Ah! Why do you hammer the sushi?

344
00:20:07,194 --> 00:20:08,569
Why do you hammer that?

345
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:15,569
I don't know, don't you chop the sushi like this?
If you're making like... like Hanamaki or something?

346
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:22,569
Well at least... at least Amen... maybe that's just a
very American perspective but at least Watson got it.

347
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:25,569
Anyway.

348
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:29,069
Oh thank goodness, thank goodness.
I thought that I was going to lose that one.

349
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:32,569
Number two! Question number two, let's go.

350
00:20:30,569 --> 00:21:21,519
小鳥遊キアラ
Takanashi Kiara

351
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:34,569
All right. Oh boy.

352
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:37,069
Oh this one's too easy. I can do this one.

353
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,569
Okay. Watch closely.

354
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:42,569
Oh... uh-huh.

355
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:45,169
Kiara! I know, Kiara! Takanashi Kiara!

356
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:47,569
Yes! I'm Takanashi Kiara!

357
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:50,569
I'm Takanashi Kiara! Too easy!

358
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:56,569
All I have to do is pull out the kick and be like...
K-K-K-Kick! It's the Kiara kick!

359
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:00,069
You do it with a lot more finesse than I do but...

360
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:03,194
Excellent, nice! I like...
I like that angle, that's good!

361
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:05,569
Oh thank goodness! Should I try it again?

362
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:07,569
Yes! Nice, nice! Get the kick one more time,
thank you!

363
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:11,569
Oh! Thank you! Kiara can do it with her
whole body as much as me!

364
00:21:12,194 --> 00:21:14,069
Oh! Thank you! Yeah!

365
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:16,569
I probably learned that a lot today.

366
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:19,569
Whoa! Well, I don't really know what you mean
by that but anyway, question number three!

367
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:21,569
Question number three, the last,
most difficult question. Here we go.

368
00:21:22,069 --> 00:24:00,269
ホラー映画で最初に死ぬ人
The First Person to Die in a Horror Movie

369
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:25,569
No! Oh no!

370
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:29,569
Oh no! This is impossible! Okay, right, hold on.

371
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:32,194
Okay. Hold on.

372
00:21:33,219 --> 00:21:35,569
Hmm. Think, Calli, think.

373
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:40,069
What? What are you doing? Mushy?

374
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,569
Oh no! Dead!

375
00:21:43,194 --> 00:21:45,569
G-reaping... Reaping, I think.

376
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:48,069
Uh, bad guy killing someone.

377
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:49,569
Close, you're very close!

378
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:53,219
Murder... a murder... a villain killing someone!

379
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:54,569
Yes! Villain!

380
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:57,169
Someone... Stabbing someone! Stabbing someone!
Criminal!

381
00:21:57,194 --> 00:21:59,069
And somebody died!

382
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:04,569
Uh... Oh no, begging for mercy and died- dying.

383
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:08,069
Uh... Well maybe if I can use my fingers.

384
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,569
Your fingers, okay. Okay. Okay.

385
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:13,569
Uh, a tiny ball? No tiny ball.

386
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:15,569
What number is this?

387
00:22:16,194 --> 00:22:17,569
Two- two. No.

388
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:19,569
One! Yes! One!

389
00:22:20,194 --> 00:22:21,569
Seven! One! One!

390
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:25,569
One! One guy stabbing someone! One stab!

391
00:22:26,194 --> 00:22:28,069
One punch! One! Number one!

392
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:31,569
One! One guy running away?

393
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:34,069
One guy being killed!

394
00:22:34,194 --> 00:22:35,569
Close!

395
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:37,569
One guy about to die! Close!

396
00:22:38,194 --> 00:22:40,069
What specifically more about them? Uh...

397
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:43,069
A murder relationship? One bad guy!

398
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:46,569
One... I'm going to kill whoever chose this
question. I'm going to kill them!

399
00:22:47,194 --> 00:22:51,569
I think I might lose this one guys. Oh boy.

400
00:22:53,194 --> 00:22:56,569
Reaper... Reper-r-r... Uh... a murderer...

401
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:07,569
Yes! The murderer! Don't kill me!
Please don't kill me!

402
00:23:08,194 --> 00:23:10,569
No! My friend! Please don't kill me!

403
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:12,569
I... No! Running for your life!

404
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:15,569
Rest in peace! Rest in peace!
All my friends are alive and I am dead!

405
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:18,569
Someone died! Someone- someone died!

406
00:23:19,194 --> 00:23:21,069
People die when they are killed!

407
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:23,069
I lost this one!

408
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:26,569
Someone died by being stabbed to death?
Bleeding to death?

409
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:28,569
That was too freaking specific!

410
00:23:29,194 --> 00:23:32,069
Okay, the answer was 'the first person to die
in a horror movie'!

411
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:34,569
Aww! How am I supposed to indicate
that I'm the first person?

412
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:38,194
That's difficult! That's hard but you guys got
it for the most part.

413
00:23:39,194 --> 00:23:41,069
How can you be so specific? Right, I know...

414
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:44,569
...but you guys got it for the most part.
So you guys did your best.

415
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:47,569
We all did our best, yeah. Ah, but you know what,
that was fun with you guys, honestly.

416
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:52,569
Oh man, I'm so glad we got to play
a little game together.

417
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:56,569
You guys need to get over here too and do
some 3D with me, okay?

418
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:58,569
Yes! Of course! I'm waiting for you!

419
00:23:59,194 --> 00:24:02,069
Do your best! Do your best, Calli! I will!

420
00:24:02,194 --> 00:24:05,569
I hope you'll keep watching for the
announcement! So excited!

421
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,569
Thank you! I'm excited too! Ah!

422
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:12,069
Thanks for coming and making time for me.
I know it's really early for some folks here...

423
00:24:12,194 --> 00:24:16,569
...and really inconvenient timing, so thank you
so much for being here to support me.

424
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:20,069
And if you check out the concert...
don't- don't make me start crying!

425
00:24:20,194 --> 00:24:22,569
Thank you for inviting us! Oh... I love you guys!

426
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:26,569
Of course we gotta be here for this special
event! Yeah! Bye guys!

427
00:24:27,194 --> 00:24:29,069
Happy birthday girl! Happy birthday!
I love y'all!

428
00:24:29,194 --> 00:24:32,069
It's my birthday! It's my birthday!
I'm gonna kick it like it's my birthday!

429
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:34,569
Thank you so much everyone!

430
00:24:35,194 --> 00:24:38,194
I'll see you guys soon then, okay? Okay! Bye!

431
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:41,569
Bye-bye! Goodbye my friend! Thank you!

432
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:45,069
Bye everyone! See you! There they go.

433
00:24:49,194 --> 00:24:52,069
Well I guess that that means it's time for the
singing portion.

434
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:56,569
I did get to shake off some of the nerves
thanks to my friends...

435
00:24:57,194 --> 00:25:01,469
...because my heart's been racing today,
but because I got to talk to them and I know
that they're supporting me...

436
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:01,391
I feel good.

437
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:03,301
I feel like we can put on a show,

438
00:25:03,431 --> 00:25:04,301
and I'll do my best.

439
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:07,211
It's my first time really doing this like live,

440
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,651
so I'm trying not to run out of energy.

441
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,311
I gotta take... I gotta take Kiara's idol expertise to heart.

442
00:25:11,471 --> 00:25:14,451
I should know that too, being a rapper as well, but you know, I forget.

443
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:18,571
And plus, you know, the speakers go boom-boom-boom all the time.

444
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:20,881
Anyway, let's... let's do a show, alright?

445
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:23,311
Let's do a show, you guys!

446
00:25:24,161 --> 00:25:25,941
I'll do my... I'll do my best, okay?

447
00:25:26,621 --> 00:25:29,431
Nervous or tired? A little bit of both, but also ready to go.

448
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:31,101
Let's do this, okay?

449
00:25:31,331 --> 00:25:32,521
Let's go to the stage!

450
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,731
わっしょい、わっしょい、わっしょい！
Washoi, washoi, washoi!

451
00:25:54,081 --> 00:26:05,081
spiral tones
Lyrics • Composition: 律可, Mori Calliope
spiral tones
Lyrics • Composition: Rikka, Mori Calliope

452
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:09,211
Ah. Imagine, take a look,

453
00:26:09,211 --> 00:26:10,591
it's a change of age,

454
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:12,431
more an open book that's got a lot to say.

455
00:26:12,431 --> 00:26:13,751
Like a spiral, others say out of control,

456
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:15,731
but we just keep spinning still for that soul.

457
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:17,421
Stay committed to the sick vibes, good music,

458
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:19,081
rhythmic type cruising, proof, isn't it?

459
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,651
But you'll lose it, stuck on yesterday

460
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:22,461
'cause it only really matters if you play it that way. Uh.

461
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:23,911
How would you rate this? Add it to your playlist.

462
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:27,281
Got something to say, but only when your face'll stay stasis.

463
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:28,981
You ain't gotta be held back by the status quo.

464
00:26:28,981 --> 00:26:30,681
When the odds are stacked, we'll make a badass show.

465
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:33,801
With our ways with words, blast off to another vista way of the world.

466
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,421
Move fast when we want to run, knock 'em unconscious,

467
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:36,951
bring 'em back to life and tell 'em, 'Hey, watch this!'

468
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:40,481
そんな音色で 終われるはずがない
There's no way it can end with such a tone

469
00:26:40,481 --> 00:26:43,681
新しいことに挑むには
In order to challenge new things

470
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:48,481
いっそ開き直り切るくらいの方が ちょうどいい
It's better to just go all out with defiance

471
00:26:50,081 --> 00:26:53,381
おかしくない？ Don't be surrender.
Isn't it strange? Don't be surrender.

472
00:26:53,381 --> 00:26:56,881
三秒で分からせて
Make me understand in three seconds

473
00:26:56,881 --> 00:27:00,081
止まない It's awesome 拍手喝采
Unceasingly, it's awesome, a round of applause

474
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:03,381
進化するフロー
An evolving flow

475
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:06,681
次元を超えて 見失わぬよう
Transcending dimensions, so as not to lose sight

476
00:27:06,681 --> 00:27:11,481
その呼吸を射抜いて
Pierce through that breath

477
00:27:11,481 --> 00:27:16,881
重なり合っていく spiral tones
Overlapping, spiral tones

478
00:27:22,431 --> 00:27:25,681
ここらで勝手な想像 後出しも早々 沸いてそう
Right around here, selfish imaginations are brewing up

479
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:27,181
揚げ足取り 野暮な呟き
Nitpicking, insensitive mutterings

480
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:30,481
誰得で寒い もうな、ログ
Who is this for? It's chilling. Already, a log.

481
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:33,881
簡単に考えりゃいいよ 厄介な心配は無用
Just think about it simply. No need for troublesome worries

482
00:27:33,881 --> 00:27:37,081
ありもしない 後悔なんてナンセンス
Regrets for things that don't exist are nonsense

483
00:27:37,081 --> 00:27:40,481
これで開眼できたら僥倖 最大限ハイファイで
If you can open your eyes with this, it's a blessing. With maximum hi-fi

484
00:27:40,481 --> 00:27:44,281
身体を震わす音の波線 何度だい
How many times have sound waves vibrated your body?

485
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:47,381
それでも分からないなら
If you still don't understand

486
00:27:47,381 --> 00:27:51,881
拝啓 誠意をどうぞ
Dear someone, please show some sincerity

487
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:55,281
Notes on ideologies, hella ancient, junk, fond, no apologies,

488
00:27:55,281 --> 00:27:58,581
with your anxious creationists, thankless demolitions imminent.

489
00:27:58,581 --> 00:28:01,881
Waiting for the movement, not just beginning it. First try winging it,

490
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:06,081
see you have an issue, limitless bringing this sick vibes, tribute's yada you don't say but hey guess what? Your old news done living with your eyes blind shut.

491
00:28:06,181 --> 00:28:09,481
おかしくない？ Don't be surrender.
Isn't it strange? Don't be surrender.

492
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:12,781
三分で口ずさめる
You can hum it in three minutes

493
00:28:12,781 --> 00:28:16,081
続けて It's awesome 震天動地
Continually, it's awesome, world-shaking

494
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:19,481
増えていくフロック
Increasing flukes

495
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:22,681
次元を超えて 見失わぬよう
Transcending dimensions, so as not to lose sight

496
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:27,481
その期待値を射抜いて
Pierce through those expectations

497
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:32,481
大人になんてない spiral tones
There's no such thing as becoming an adult, spiral tones

498
00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:33,881
Can't ignore forever.

499
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,381
What could make you better?

500
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:38,881
Anyway, anyway, anyway, no wonder.

501
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:44,281
嫌いが好きに変わったって
Even if hate changed into love

502
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:48,781
おかしくない？ Don't be surrender.
Isn't it strange? Don't be surrender.

503
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:52,081
三秒で分からせて
Make me understand in three seconds

504
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:55,381
止まない It's awesome 拍手喝采
Unceasingly, it's awesome, a round of applause

505
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:58,681
進化するフロー
An evolving flow

506
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:02,081
次元を超えて 見失わぬよう
Transcending dimensions, so as not to lose sight

507
00:29:02,081 --> 00:29:06,681
その呼吸を射抜いて
Pierce through that breath

508
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:15,581
重なり合っていく spiral tones
Overlapping, spiral tones

509
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:36,081
重なり合っていく spiral tones
Overlapping, spiral tones

おめでとう！
Congratulations!

521
00:30:05,193 --> 00:30:06,893
Rikka-senpai, I'm so happy.

522
00:30:07,093 --> 00:30:09,393
ついに一緒にやれたね、なんか。
Finally, we got to do this together.

523
00:30:09,493 --> 00:30:10,593
Finally!

524
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:11,293
ねえ。
Yeah.

525
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:12,393
ようやく。
At long last.

526
00:30:12,493 --> 00:30:16,293
Yeah, we can perform on the same stage together.

527
00:30:16,493 --> 00:30:19,493
なんか前ね、約束、promiseしてたもんね。
We made a promise before, didn't we?

528
00:30:19,493 --> 00:30:20,593
We promised.

529
00:30:20,593 --> 00:30:21,593
We promised.

530
00:30:21,593 --> 00:30:22,593
You're right. We promised.

531
00:30:22,693 --> 00:30:25,593
呼んでくれてありがとう、special day。
Thanks for inviting me on your special day.

532
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,593
Of course, of course!
Thank you for coming here on my special day.

533
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:31,593
And I loved making Spiral Tones together with you.

534
00:30:31,693 --> 00:30:36,593
凄い、えっと、Spiral Tones作るの凄い楽しかった。
It was so much fun making "Spiral Tones."

535
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:38,293
楽しかった。
It was fun.

536
00:30:38,293 --> 00:30:39,593
ねえ、right. ねえ、良いコラボ。
Yeah, right. It was a great collab.

537
00:30:39,593 --> 00:30:41,093
Right?

538
00:30:41,193 --> 00:30:45,893
Someday, いつか、また凄い素敵な曲作りたいと思います。
Someday, I'd like to make another wonderful song.

539
00:30:45,893 --> 00:30:48,393
あーもう、また作ろう。全部英語のとかね。
Oh, let's make another one. All in English, maybe?

540
00:30:48,393 --> 00:30:50,393
あー、そうね。
Ah, yeah.

541
00:30:50,493 --> 00:30:52,393
An all English song.

542
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:56,593
An all English song? I wonder... 出来るかな？
絶対出来ると思う。頑張ったら絶対出来るよ。
An all English song? I wonder... Can we do it?
I think we definitely can. We can do it if we try!

543
00:30:56,693 --> 00:31:02,093
Rikka-senpaiの英語、あの、少しずつ上手くなってきて、
聞いたと思います。
I heard Rikka-senpai's English is
getting better and better!

544
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,393
本当に？
Really?

545
00:31:03,393 --> 00:31:04,593
Thank you.

546
00:31:04,593 --> 00:31:06,593
凄い！頑張る、頑張る。
Amazing! I'll do my best.

547
00:31:06,593 --> 00:31:07,593
頑張ってね。
Good luck!

548
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:10,093
うん。また曲ね、一緒に作ったり。
Yeah. Let's make songs together again...

549
00:31:10,093 --> 00:31:11,293
Please, of course.

550
00:31:11,293 --> 00:31:12,393
ライブも。
And do lives too.

551
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:13,393
Yes.

552
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:14,593
全体で頑張りましょう、ホロでね。
Let's do our best overall as Holo.

553
00:31:14,693 --> 00:31:15,593
Yes, let's do it!

554
00:31:15,593 --> 00:31:16,893
Thank you.

555
00:31:16,893 --> 00:31:18,593
And I always support Holostars.

556
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:21,093
ホロスターズ、いつも応援しています。
I'm always rooting for Holostars.

557
00:31:21,093 --> 00:31:22,293
ホント、ありがたい。
I really appreciate it.

558
00:31:22,293 --> 00:31:24,093
ありがとうございます、本当に。頑張ってくださいね。
Thank you so much. Good luck!

559
00:31:24,193 --> 00:31:26,593
ホロスターズもめっちゃ素敵だと思う。
I think Holostars is really wonderful, too.

560
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,293
いや、HoloEN最高。
HoloEN is the best!

561
00:31:28,293 --> 00:31:29,593
優しい、優しい。
You're so kind!

562
00:31:29,693 --> 00:31:31,593
Thank you my man, Rikka. Thank you so much.

563
00:31:31,693 --> 00:31:33,293
Great singer.

564
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:36,293
Great singer too, and guitar! 凄い。
Great singer too, and guitar! Amazing!

565
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:39,593
えー、ギター、全然出来ない私。
I can't play the guitar at all.

566
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:40,893
全然いい。
That's totally fine.

567
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:42,593
むずい、むずいよ。
It's so hard!

568
00:31:42,593 --> 00:31:44,593
ラップ、ラップが出来れば。
As long as you can rap!

569
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:46,593
Thank you!

570
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:50,093
We have our specialties. 得意、得意なとこ。
We each have our strengths.

571
00:31:50,093 --> 00:31:52,593
まあ一緒にね、色々やれば
Well, if we do various things together...

572
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:54,293
そうね。
Yeah.

573
00:31:54,293 --> 00:31:56,293
全部いい感じになるよ。
Everything will turn out great.

574
00:31:56,293 --> 00:31:59,093
Right! Combine our power. Nice combination.

575
00:31:59,193 --> 00:32:00,693
ナイスコンビネーションね。
Nice combination.

576
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:02,193
それが一番だと思う。
I think that's the best.

577
00:32:02,193 --> 00:32:03,093
ありがとう。
Thank you.

578
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:04,293
ありがとうございます、Rikka-senpai.
Thank you, Rikka-senpai.

579
00:32:04,293 --> 00:32:05,393
ありがとうね。
Thank you.

580
00:32:05,393 --> 00:32:07,593
また絶対やりましょう。See you!
Let's definitely do it again. See you!

581
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:08,593
See you! Thank you so much!

582
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,293
Goodbye senpai! Bye bye, Rikka! See you!

583
00:32:11,293 --> 00:32:13,593
Gosh, Rikka-senpai's so cool.

584
00:32:13,693 --> 00:32:17,593
Man, what an awesome dude and great musician.

585
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:20,093
Check out Rikka's stuff, please.

586
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:22,393
Check out Rikka's channel.
He does a lot of music stuff.

587
00:32:22,393 --> 00:32:25,593
I know that a lot of my Dead Beats love my music
and stuff like that that I make...

588
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:30,093
So I always have my recommended musicians amongst the
Holo crew, and Rikka's definitely one of them.

589
00:32:30,193 --> 00:32:33,293
And check out the Stars, 'cause they're working
super hard too.

590
00:32:33,393 --> 00:32:35,893
Now then. Since we started off with a guest song...

591
00:32:35,993 --> 00:32:39,593
I figured it's probably time for me to take it on
my own.

592
00:32:39,693 --> 00:32:42,293
But I need a little bit of water.

593
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,293
This always happens at every show I go to.

594
00:32:44,293 --> 00:32:48,593
It's like every single song that I do, it's like in
between, I'm like "Okay, water, water."

595
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:50,593
It's become a joke, honestly.

596
00:32:50,693 --> 00:32:51,593
Hold on.

597
00:32:51,693 --> 00:32:54,693
But you can't see it. It's the mysterious water
bottle you can't see.

598
00:32:58,593 --> 00:32:59,593
All right.

599
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:00,693
Oh, by the way, check out the stage!

600
00:33:00,693 --> 00:33:02,593
You see that cool skeleton?

601
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:07,893
Yeah, this is my special Hololive made-to-order
Calliope Mori stage...

602
00:33:07,993 --> 00:33:13,593
With my cool skeletons with the wings designed
after the "UnAlive" album art by Rei.

603
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:17,593
Check it. Check out my ガイコツたち。My skeletons.
Check it. Check out my skeletons. My skeletons.

604
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:20,593
It's like you guys, sitting behind me, supporting me.

605
00:33:20,693 --> 00:33:24,593
Couldn't have skeleton back-up dancers this time,
maybe next time. You'll be watching.

606
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:27,593
Anyway, shall we go to the next song?

607
00:33:27,693 --> 00:33:32,293
Let's do it. "The Grim Reaper is a Live-Streamer."

608
00:33:36,093 --> 00:33:45,093
The Grim Reaper is a Live-Streamer
Lyrics: Mori Calliope, てにをは / Composition: てにをは
The Grim Reaper is a Live-Streamer
Lyrics: Mori Calliope, teniwoha / Composition: teniwoha

609
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:52,593
3, 2, 1, swing it!

610
00:33:52,593 --> 00:33:54,593
お騒がせね Ladies
Pardon me, ladies

611
00:33:54,593 --> 00:33:56,593
Dead Beats swinging out, out of control

612
00:33:56,593 --> 00:33:58,593
シャラララララバ
Sha-la-la-la-la-bye

613
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:00,593
誰も気付かない
No one notices

614
00:34:00,593 --> 00:34:03,093
The variety of life, ha ha, you know?

615
00:34:03,193 --> 00:34:04,593
全方向ランデブー
All-direction rendezvous

616
00:34:04,593 --> 00:34:06,593
Alright, never-missing moon

617
00:34:06,593 --> 00:34:09,593
今あなたの隣に死神がいますよ
Right now, a reaper is right next to you

618
00:34:09,593 --> 00:34:11,293
Yeah, right.

619
00:34:11,293 --> 00:34:13,293
Let’s hit the crosswalk, let’s talk, can you keep up?

620
00:34:13,293 --> 00:34:15,593
You’re kind of 気になり looking like a dose of enough
You’re kind of curious looking like a dose of enough

621
00:34:15,593 --> 00:34:17,593
A petite rendezvous, we’re bound to stray far

622
00:34:17,593 --> 00:34:20,293
I'm the kind to ease your mind,
but take you to the graveyard

623
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:21,893
Step out to the city, but you don't know me

624
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,593
Take my wits right with me, but they don't know me

625
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:25,593
Maybe feel like going psycho in the streets

626
00:34:25,593 --> 00:34:27,593
Save that for later, instead I'll make a stylish treat

627
00:34:27,593 --> 00:34:30,293
I go live, go high, so fly, oh my

628
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:31,593
No drive, this guy, talk about misfire

629
00:34:31,593 --> 00:34:33,293
Leave it to me, spit fire, fitting for cash

630
00:34:33,293 --> 00:34:35,093
I'll never be caught again, right in this office bash

631
00:34:35,093 --> 00:34:37,093
Honestly, I never had life to begin with

632
00:34:37,093 --> 00:34:40,293
And now I got you, double the power to sin with

633
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:42,593
But not like I'll complain, just laughing, just saying...

634
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:45,593
晴れ日を上手の手の表裏
Fair days, inside and out of a skilled hand

635
00:34:45,593 --> 00:34:48,593
輝く演者の晴れ舞台
The shining performer’s grand stage

636
00:34:48,593 --> 00:34:51,593
高々空浮かぶは我が調べ
Floating high in the sky is my melody

637
00:34:51,593 --> 00:34:56,293
表はどうか尋ねないで
Please don't ask about the outside

638
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:57,293
Don't know, don't know, don't know...

639
00:34:57,293 --> 00:34:59,293
お騒がせね Ladies
Pardon me, ladies

640
00:34:59,293 --> 00:35:00,693
Down, down, 歌わせて
Down, down, let me sing

641
00:35:00,105 --> 00:35:02,105
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la...

642
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,105
誰も気付かない
No one notices

643
00:35:04,155 --> 00:35:05,605
日和見をトハ
The opportunism

644
00:35:05,755 --> 00:35:07,605
今宵には
On this night

645
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,605
Never missing moon

646
00:35:09,755 --> 00:35:11,605
誰かを照らす
Shining on someone

647
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,605
As far as telling horror stories goes

648
00:35:13,755 --> 00:35:15,605
My kind of warfare

649
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,605
Lift the curtain for one hell of a show

650
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,105
And now action!

651
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,105
Transmission live before you

652
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,105
Everything real-time

653
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,105
Just don't forget admission

654
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,105
The soul's still mine

655
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,105
Out on the town again, death in your midst

656
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,105
Right behind you, down below, listen you get the gist

657
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,105
Nobody realizing, they don't recognize me

658
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,105
Fine by me, it's agonizingly disguised, see?

659
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,105
Life now broadcasting, only so long lasting

660
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,105
Rather it's a matter of a right and wrong casting

661
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,105
Fasten your seatbelt fast, or do you need help?

662
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,605
Need that fresh air?

663
00:35:42,755 --> 00:35:44,605
海辺に掻き立てた摩訶
Stirred up on the seashore, a wonder

664
00:35:44,755 --> 00:35:46,605
溶けてゆく日々の中に
In the days that melt away

665
00:35:46,755 --> 00:35:48,605
鮮出し魔法
Vivid magic

666

上書きしてく素っ気ないし
Overwriting it, blunt as it is

667
00:35:50,755 --> 00:35:52,605
という意味
That's what it means

668
00:35:52,755 --> 00:35:54,605
正解は自分で探してみ
Try looking for the answer yourself

669
00:35:54,755 --> 00:35:56,605
月に裏も表もねえ
The moon has neither front nor back

670
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,105
Have a great night!

今宵には
On this night

677
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,605
Never missing moon

678
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:13,605
誰かを照らす
Shining on someone

679
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,605
As far as telling horror stories goes

680
00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:17,605
My kind of warfare

681
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,605
Lift the curtain for one hell of a show

682
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,605
And now action!

00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,105
I'm a girl of a whole lot of adjectives

720
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,105
A couple might say stubborn, rude, heartless

721
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,105
And the craziest, praise me with secrets please, no guise please

722

Say burnin' hot, you can start to see the scars

Hit the grind, now we shinin', see how far we've done came

725
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,105
Our shame's in a numbers game, some fun first fame, second win

00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,105
And stop, 'cause we livin' in the moment and we own it

Better pick a direction and run with an alibi

730

00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,105
With the angels and devils it's a do or die

Except this time, it's a Mori Calliope
featuring Hoshimachi Suisei song.

778
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:40,917
A brand new song and it's very important because
after we perform this song,

779
00:41:41,017 --> 00:41:46,417
there's a really, really big announcement.
It's 'the' one.

780
00:41:46,517 --> 00:41:50,917
It's the announcement I mentioned
that's the biggest of my entire life.

So please look forward to it, and it has
something to do with the song we're doing.

So, we're going to do our brand new song.

Lyrics: DECO*27, Mori Calliope / Composition: DECO*27

793
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:40,917
冗談ねちゃって a-ha
Just kidding, a-ha

794
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,917
此処ろまたやっちゃった
Done it again here

795
00:42:43,117 --> 00:42:47,217
酸いも甘いも苦いのでも飲み干せば All right
Sour, sweet, or even bitter, if you drink it all up, it's All right

796
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:51,217
Stand up, nothing’s no sinners,
Man up, this is where it takes off

797
00:42:51,317 --> 00:42:55,317
And even sweat when the going gets rough,
And I’m leaving ‘til the last laugh

798
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:57,517
間違い探しじゃ致し方ないなきっと
Finding mistakes can't be helped, I'm sure

00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:06,629
Um, you'll see later when you read the kanji, but, uh...

876

00:48:26,629 --> 00:48:31,129
Um, I'm still going to make the music that I want to make and for the world that I want to see.

882
00:48:31,129 --> 00:48:35,129
This is a little corny, but... anyway...

883
00:48:35,129 --> 00:48:39,129
This is like the biggest thing that's ever happened to me in my life.

884
00:48:39,129 --> 00:48:44,129
So and I wouldn't be here if... if you guys didn't love what I do so much and support me...

902
00:49:48,129 --> 00:49:52,629
...which is kind of a popular play on words in Japan. So, um, yeah.

903
00:49:52,629 --> 00:49:57,129
My first major EP. And we have the art done by my fantastic Mama, Yukisame Mama.

904
00:49:57,129 --> 00:49:59,929
You can scan the...

905
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:01,541

July 20th, July 20th

908
00:50:06,441 --> 00:50:10,641
and that will include 'Capsule'. By the way, 'Capsule's art was illustrated by Nardack.

909
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:12,841
So let's give a big ups to Nardack as well.

910
00:50:13,141 --> 00:50:17,141
But if you guys want to pre-order and I recommend you pre-order cause you get some cool stuff

911
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:19,441
you can scan the QR code right now.

912
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:22,141
次に行きます。Next slide.
Going to the next. Next slide.

913
00:50:23,141 --> 00:50:25,641
Because if you order the first press limited edition,

914
00:50:25,641 --> 00:50:30,141
you get the LP-sized set, which is a CD plus DVD plus extras.

915
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:34,141
It's LP-sized but it's not a record, it's just like the size of a record,

916
00:50:34,141 --> 00:50:38,341
but it's got the CD in it, the Shinigami Note EP CD,

917
00:50:38,341 --> 00:50:43,141
as well as five original LP-sized cover jackets drawn by various artists.

918
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:47,441
You guys are going to love these art pieces, they're so cool.

919
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:51,641
And then I also will be doing an interview, 30 minutes, on DVD,

920
00:50:51,641 --> 00:50:55,141
behind-the-scenes of the creation of the EP.

921
00:50:55,341 --> 00:50:59,641
And then also you get a crest badge, honorary Dead Beat crest badge.

922
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:04,341
So yeah, that's pretty neat. But just so you guys know, these are super limited,

923
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:06,541
like we only have a certain amount of them,

924
00:51:06,641 --> 00:51:09,741
so if you want it, you may want to try and grab it before it's gone,

925
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:13,641
because these are not infinite and we are never making them again.

926
00:51:14,141 --> 00:51:18,641
So you may want to grab these as soon as possible if you're interested.

927
00:51:19,141 --> 00:51:22,141
And then we've got the standard version of course including the same songs,

928
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:27,641
and then we have bonus items depending on each outlet that you use to buy the CD.

929
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:31,641
So you'll see those items pretty soon when the EP comes out.

930
00:51:31,641 --> 00:51:37,641
It's available for pre-order everywhere but you'll get little bonus items depending on which store you buy from.

931
00:51:38,141 --> 00:51:42,641
So again scan the QR code if you're interested. 次に行きます！Let's go to the next slide.
So again scan the QR code if you're interested. Going to the next! Let's go to the next slide.

932
00:51:43,641 --> 00:51:48,941
And finally! My first solo concert, July 21st, 2022 at Toyosu Pit.

933
00:51:49,141 --> 00:51:53,141
That's the day after the EP drops. I want to see you guys there.

934
00:51:53,341 --> 00:51:56,641
More information coming soon but save the date.

935
00:51:57,141 --> 00:52:00,641
And don't worry you guys if you're overseas and you can't get to Japan, no worries,

936
00:52:00,641 --> 00:52:05,641
because it will be streamed live to you and you will be able to buy a ticket for it.

937
00:52:06,141 --> 00:52:09,541
So please don't worry about that, fans all over the world,

938
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:12,841
you guys will get a chance to see it, so please anticipate it.

939
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:18,541
We're working very hard on it and yeah I hope you'll have fun. That's all, 以上です。 That's all.
We're working very hard on it and yeah I hope you'll have fun. That's all, that's all. That's all.

940
00:52:19,141 --> 00:52:22,141
So I figured the next song that I would sing would be...

941
00:52:22,341 --> 00:52:26,141
sort of a celebration of moving on to the next.

942
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:30,641
I wrote this song to kind of come to terms with me moving on...

943
00:52:31,141 --> 00:52:37,141
...from Japan's underground rap scene and embracing what I have found here in Holo.

944
00:52:37,441 --> 00:52:40,541
And things won't change with me in terms of Holo,

945
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:45,141
I'll still stream for you guys and collab with my friends and do music collabs with them too.

946
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:51,141
But when it comes to my original music, Universal's going to be kind of with me throughout the journey.

947
00:52:51,341 --> 00:52:54,441
So don't worry, I'm not leaving or anything. I'm still here.

948
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:57,441
But things maybe become a little more focused on the music.

949
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:00,541
Things might change a little bit, but again I don't want you to worry.

950
00:53:00,641 --> 00:53:06,141
I'm really excited about this, so let's rather try and celebrate together,

951
00:53:06,341 --> 00:53:13,641
looking towards a positive future with the next song, end of a life. Let's go.

952
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:22,941
We’d run right through those nights

953
00:53:22,941 --> 00:53:28,841
I’ll never find my way back to you inside this labyrinth of lights

954
00:53:28,841 --> 00:53:34,141
There was madness in the meaning, never laughless, we were screaming

955
00:53:34,141 --> 00:53:39,141
At the top of our lungs to the numbingness This city never died

956
00:53:39,141 --> 00:53:44,341
I’ll fly no proof those heights

957
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:50,141
I’ll never find another chance to say “thanks for saving my life”

958
00:53:50,141 --> 00:53:55,341
I was hopeless, it was stinging, running roadless, we were singing

959
00:53:55,341 --> 00:54:00,341
At the top of our lungs to the numbingness This city never died

960
00:54:00,741 --> 00:54:03,541
What was the root of it all? I couldn't say

961
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:06,141
Used to jump and then fall, well, getting cliché

962
00:54:06,141 --> 00:54:08,641
We'd shrug it off without complaint, not a sound

963
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:11,341
No use in trying to find friends 'cause in the end nobody sticks around

964
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:13,941
It's when you shoved yourself into a crowded place

965
00:54:13,941 --> 00:54:16,641
That you turned around and found yourself in love and outer space

966
00:54:16,641 --> 00:54:19,541
Cue the reckless nights, no strings, laughing at our own dreams

967
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:21,341
Just what the hell was so funny?

968
00:54:21,741 --> 00:54:24,441
Up the wrong tree, stumble, used to fall and grey heart

969
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:27,141
Abyss to concrete jungle, singing 'cause it felt right

970
00:54:27,141 --> 00:54:29,941
We mixed the ennui and troubles rhyming art's intent

971
00:54:29,941 --> 00:54:32,541
And though it's history I can't forget the time we spent

972
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:35,441
Convinced that this could mean another end exists between real and pretend

973
00:54:35,441 --> 00:54:38,341
A twisted ultra fiction where I missed my chance to not ascend

974
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:40,941
Disappearing into the mist of “never happened”

975
00:54:40,941 --> 00:54:43,141
Is it to me that I can never be a friend?

976
00:54:43,241 --> 00:54:44,941
I let it go

977
00:54:44,941 --> 00:54:49,141
Fade in, fade out, this crazy dream

978
00:54:49,141 --> 00:54:54,641
Without a direction flowing aimlessly

979
00:54:54,641 --> 00:55:00,141
There's nothing left back there for me

980
00:55:00,553 --> 00:55:04,353
Breathe in, but it won't stop the rain
from pouring right through

981
00:55:09,653 --> 00:55:12,253
Those nights, I'll never find my way

982
00:55:12,353 --> 00:55:14,753
back to you inside this labyrinth of lights

983
00:55:14,953 --> 00:55:17,553
There was madness in the meaning, never mindless,

984
00:55:17,653 --> 00:55:20,253
we were screaming at the top of our lungs

985
00:55:20,353 --> 00:55:23,153
To the numinous, this city never died,

986
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:25,953
but was there ever a soul inside?

987
00:55:26,653 --> 00:55:28,953
Chasing fireflies between the soaring high rises,

988
00:55:29,053 --> 00:55:31,353
left a trail behind to find a waste of time...

989
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,153
Silent finger over words and underpaid,

990
00:55:34,253 --> 00:55:36,653
things a synopsis, a coffin, and cenotaphs...

991
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:39,153
Yet a thought persists: not optimist
you ought to be afraid,

992
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,653
saw that nothing wrong and right
and songs behind the low-lit shade

993
00:55:41,753 --> 00:55:44,153
Is the world a sadder place
without the words that you evade,

994
00:55:44,253 --> 00:55:46,653
when the ladder fell and shattered
every bar that we had played?

995
00:55:46,753 --> 00:55:49,153
Does it matter in the end,
the sound diminished and decayed,

996
00:55:49,253 --> 00:55:51,753
and your friends grew tired of fantasy
you're wishing they had stayed?

997
00:55:51,853 --> 00:55:54,453
You don't get to say I miss you,
you watched your heroes fade

998
00:55:54,553 --> 00:55:57,353
into the rear view mirror of the villain
you portrayed

999
00:55:57,453 --> 00:56:00,153
Stop the pity party, listen,
you don't get to be dismayed,

1000
00:56:00,253 --> 00:56:02,453
you don't get to be emotional,
feel blessed you got it made

1001
00:56:02,553 --> 00:56:04,953
The best years of life because
you chose to make a trade,

1002
00:56:05,053 --> 00:56:07,453
recollect the days you hoped and you prayed
for this, what is there to miss?

1003
00:56:08,653 --> 00:56:13,453
Fade in, fade out,
this hazy dream

1004
00:56:13,553 --> 00:56:19,553
Without a direction, roaming aimlessly

1005
00:56:21,153 --> 00:56:25,153
There's nothing left back there for me,

1006
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:29,353
pretend it's the end of a made-up story

1007
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:34,153
I know for real...

1008
00:56:34,953 --> 00:56:37,553
Those highs, I'll never find another chance

1009
00:56:37,653 --> 00:56:40,053
to say thanks for saving my life

1010
00:56:40,153 --> 00:56:42,653
I was hopeless, it was spinning,

1011
00:56:42,753 --> 00:56:45,453
driving roadless, we were singing
at the top of our lungs

1012
00:56:45,553 --> 00:56:48,153
To the numinous, this city never died,

1013
00:56:48,253 --> 00:56:50,953
I'll say goodbye to the souls inside

1014
00:57:44,353 --> 00:57:49,153
Waking up now to my real life,
let me daydream 'til the next flight

1015
00:57:49,253 --> 00:57:54,153
Drowning so long I got older,
now the crowd's gone, is it over?

1016
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:56,653
Is it over?

1017
00:58:07,353 --> 00:58:11,353
Thank you so much everyone!
Thank you! Thank you!

1018
00:58:13,153 --> 00:58:17,653
Oh my gosh, all the hearts and the claps
in the chat! I saw so many people

1019
00:58:17,753 --> 00:58:22,653
being so supportive in the chat, and you guys
are amazing and I love you guys so much!

1020
00:58:22,753 --> 00:58:27,653
Thank you so much for being my fans,
honestly, it means the world to me.

1021
00:58:27,753 --> 00:58:31,653
And um, and I have some other things
to show you as well.

1022
00:58:32,153 --> 00:58:37,153
My birthday merch! Of course I made
goods for you guys, I wanted to make

1023
00:58:37,253 --> 00:58:41,653
some really cool merch for my birthday
as well, for my amazing Dead Beats.

1024
00:58:41,753 --> 00:58:42,653
So let's go ahead and show them!

1025
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:47,653
Alright, first of all we've got a beautiful
illustration by Nardack to show off the

1026
00:58:47,753 --> 00:58:51,653
release of my birthday celebration merch.
We've got a birthday voice and four merch items.

1027
00:58:51,753 --> 00:58:54,653
We have a Dead Beat honorary sweater,

1028
00:58:54,753 --> 00:58:57,653
my favorite wine glass for konbini wine,
and a "So Gorgeous Your Eyes Will Melt Out

1029
00:58:57,753 --> 00:59:02,653
of Your Skull Unalive" poster, and a Holo
Classic Unalive Album Vinyl. And of course,

1030
00:59:02,753 --> 00:59:06,653
if you buy everything together
you get a printed letter.

1031
00:59:07,653 --> 00:59:11,653
次に行きますね。これは日本語の説明です。
色々ありますよね。
Let's move on. This is the Japanese
explanation. There are various things.

1032
00:59:13,153 --> 00:59:16,953
買ってくださいね。よかったらどうぞどうぞ。
Yeah!
Please buy them. If you'd like,
please do. Yeah!

1033
00:59:18,653 --> 00:59:22,653
So, uh, we have many, many things here.
色々あるよ。
So, uh, we have many, many things here.
There are various things.

1034
00:59:22,753 --> 00:59:27,653
First of all, we have a Dead Beat sweater.
I designed that skull, I made that skull. Um,

1035
00:59:27,753 --> 00:59:32,653
I found a skull, I looked at a skull
and I drew a skull. And then I wrote

1036
00:59:32,753 --> 00:59:37,653
"Dead Beat" over it. Um, so hopefully you
feel cool and chill wearing this.

1037
00:59:37,753 --> 00:59:42,653
It's a one size fits all, very, very big
sweater. Big comfy cozy sweater.

1038
00:59:42,753 --> 00:59:47,653
Then we've got a beautiful wine glass with
a little gradation at the bottom. You can

1039
00:59:47,753 --> 00:59:52,653
enjoy your konbini wine with, um, a little
bit of gold Mori encrusted on top of it,

1040
00:59:52,753 --> 00:59:57,653
so I hope that you'll enjoy that. And we have
a beautiful poster designed by Ray,

1041
00:59:57,753 --> 01:00:00,153
who made my album jacket for Unalive,
my first solo album.

1042
01:00:00,165 --> 01:00:03,565
It's the alter version of Calli from the 'UnAlive' MV...

1043
01:00:03,565 --> 01:00:07,565
...and it is super amazing. It's the same size as the Your Mori one, so it's super big.

1044
01:00:07,565 --> 01:00:10,365
And it's gonna look beautiful on your wall, so I hope you guys will get it.

1045
01:00:10,365 --> 01:00:15,665
I'm looking forward to getting a bunch of them and just putting them all over my house.

1046
01:00:15,665 --> 01:00:19,165
Then we also have the UnAlive album vinyl. Right now it looks like it's just front and back...

1047
01:00:19,165 --> 01:00:23,165
...but it's actually a six-panel vinyl album. So you fold it out...

1048
01:00:23,165 --> 01:00:27,665
...and you get to see all of Rei's beautiful artwork in beautiful six-panel glory.

1049
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:32,165
So it's in the same format as the Your Mori album.

1050
01:00:32,165 --> 01:00:36,165
Everything can be bought individually this time. And uh, yeah.

1051
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:43,165
If you buy everything together, you get a special printed letter from me with some choice words from your boy and also a signature.

1052
01:00:43,165 --> 01:00:46,165
So yeah, here's the sweater. Check it out, front and back.

1053
01:00:46,165 --> 01:00:50,165
On the back, you got my little Calliope Mori logo crest at the top.

1054
01:00:50,165 --> 01:00:55,165
I designed this skull myself, looking to the side over there.

1055
01:00:55,165 --> 01:00:58,665
It's got a really cool neck. Uh, let's go next.

1056
01:00:58,665 --> 01:01:03,665
And then we've got my wine glass. This is really cool. I can't wait to drink wine out of this.

1057
01:01:03,665 --> 01:01:08,165
It's got my signature on it and everything. Beautiful golden gradient at the bottom.

1058
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:10,665
It's really lovely. Next, we've got the poster.

1059
01:01:10,665 --> 01:01:15,665
Check this art out. I die every time I look at it. Rei's work is just like a beautiful, beautiful painting.

1060
01:01:15,665 --> 01:01:21,165
So I hope that you guys will enjoy having this on your wall. And next, uh... is there a next?

1061
01:01:21,165 --> 01:01:26,665
The album, that's right. We've got the vinyl and it includes every single track from the album.

1062
01:01:26,665 --> 01:01:31,665
Check it. Um, but like I said, it's a six-panel, so you'll open it up and there'll be more than just a front and back.

1063
01:01:31,665 --> 01:01:40,165
And it's really cool. You guys are gonna love it so much. Um, so yeah.

1064
01:01:40,165 --> 01:01:44,165
That's all in terms of merchandise. Please look forward to a special letter from me.

1065
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:50,165
It'll be a printed letter from your boy to the Dead Beats who get the full set.

1066
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:53,165
And so yeah, look forward to that please.

1067
01:01:53,165 --> 01:01:55,165
楽しみにしてくださいね。
Please look forward to it.

1068
01:01:55,165 --> 01:01:58,165
Please look forward to it. Um, and yeah...

1069
01:01:58,165 --> 01:02:02,165
I hope you guys enjoyed my birthday party, but I do have one more song.

1070
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:07,165
One more song to sing to you guys. A song that's very close to my heart, about the world that we live in.

1071
01:02:07,165 --> 01:02:12,165
Because from now on, I'm gonna be trying my best with Universal and really, really...

1072
01:02:12,165 --> 01:02:14,665
...頑張る from here on out.
...try my best from here on out.

1073
01:02:14,665 --> 01:02:19,165
There's a world I want to see, and um, and it's really beautiful.

1074
01:02:19,165 --> 01:02:22,665
But things right now seem kind of dark and dreary, you know?

1075
01:02:22,665 --> 01:02:26,165
It really seems some days like just the worst days are every day, right?

1076
01:02:26,165 --> 01:02:30,665
So um, I would like to continue forward singing songs that have some kind of meaning to me.

1077
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:37,165
Whether they be about enjoying yourself and just having fun, wacky and wild fun party songs, or songs about our world.

1078
01:02:37,165 --> 01:02:42,165
This song happens to be one of those more emotional ones.

1079
01:02:42,165 --> 01:02:47,165
But let's keep moving forward towards the world that we want to see.

1080
01:02:47,165 --> 01:02:49,165
Let's go. Scuffed Up Age.

1081
01:03:00,165 --> 01:03:05,165
Scuffed Up Age
Lyrics: Mori Calliope, Camellia / Composition: Camellia

1082
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:24,565
Lost in thoughts, a frost-tipped fray of mind

1083
01:03:24,565 --> 01:03:27,865
Honest to God, it's just not our time

1084
01:03:27,865 --> 01:03:31,165
Promises flawed by cosmic design

1085
01:03:31,165 --> 01:03:35,565
これくらい取ってことない、でも涙のあとは消さない
It’s nothing much, but I won’t erase the traces of tears

1086
01:03:35,565 --> 01:03:38,365
Coming of age, the stage doesn't light up

1087
01:03:38,365 --> 01:03:41,165
Just right away, they told us it might've

1088
01:03:41,165 --> 01:03:45,465
夢はもう諦めました
I’ve already given up on dreams

1089
01:03:45,465 --> 01:03:50,165
Cynical mindset, why’d you try? Why not give up and play the bad guy?

1090
01:03:50,165 --> 01:03:53,965
分かってるさ
I know it

1091
01:03:53,965 --> 01:03:57,965
胸が涙で濡れながら
While my chest gets wet with tears

1092
01:03:57,965 --> 01:04:01,465
あなたの元へ急ぐのなら
If I hurry to where you are

1093
01:04:01,465 --> 01:04:05,265
崩れ落ちそうな体、抱きしめながら
While hugging my body that seems about to collapse

1094
01:04:05,265 --> 01:04:08,665
We choose to know

1095
01:04:08,665 --> 01:04:12,865
The struggles of this scuffed up age we’re living in

1096
01:04:12,865 --> 01:04:16,265
だからもう
So already

1097
01:04:16,265 --> 01:04:19,565
火蓋を切ってこう
Let’s start the fire

1098
01:04:19,565 --> 01:04:23,765
この夜は結構似合ってる、あなたのドレス
This night suits your dress quite well

1099
01:04:23,765 --> 01:04:26,665
それでも
Even so

1100
01:04:26,665 --> 01:04:30,965
あなたは絶対に離さないで、ねえ
You, please never let go, okay?

1101
01:04:30,965 --> 01:04:34,765
Can't find a reason to stay, some botched world led astray

1102
01:04:34,765 --> 01:04:38,665
Once trusted left to decay

1103
01:04:38,665 --> 01:04:41,965
We choose to go on anyway

1104
01:04:50,565 --> 01:04:53,765
Lost in thoughts of all with change in pace

1105
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:57,265
Allies and friends hide in more than one face

1106
01:04:57,265 --> 01:05:00,165
Not really surprising, why are you compromising?

1107
01:05:00,477 --> 01:05:01,477
Horizons and friendships like life’s in the night sins,

1108
01:05:01,477 --> 01:05:02,977
Back, so what are you prioritizing?

1109
01:05:04,177 --> 01:05:05,277
You are sick of crying?

1110
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:06,277
See I don’t buy it.

1111
01:05:06,977 --> 01:05:09,477
But here we are, hanging on, fighting strong, despite it.

1112
01:05:10,177 --> 01:05:11,877
儚い冗談は消し切れない
Fleeting jokes can't be completely erased,

1113
01:05:11,877 --> 01:05:13,277
目を閉じてしまいたい
I want to close my eyes,

1114
01:05:13,277 --> 01:05:14,677
くらい 暗い 空
to the point it's dark, a dark sky.

1115
01:05:15,277 --> 01:05:17,477
This cynical mindset why’d you try?

1116
01:05:17,477 --> 01:05:21,377
Why not give up and play the bad guy?

1117
01:05:22,577 --> 01:05:24,977
分かってないんだ
You just don't understand.

1118
01:05:25,677 --> 01:05:27,977
誇りにまみれの街で
In a city covered in pride,

1119
01:05:27,977 --> 01:05:30,777
あなたのため生き抜け
live on for your own sake,

1120
01:05:30,777 --> 01:05:33,377
私の微かな火で
with my faint light,

1121
01:05:33,377 --> 01:05:36,577
照らしたいだけ
I just want to light the way.

1122
01:05:37,477 --> 01:05:39,077
We choose to know

1123
01:05:39,077 --> 01:05:41,477
the struggles of this scuffed up age

1124
01:05:41,477 --> 01:05:44,077
We’re giving it goshani

1125
01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:47,277
よかったね
That’s good.

1126
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:49,777
Be real it hurts to grow

1127
01:05:49,777 --> 01:05:52,577
Believing in a world of hate is overrated

1128
01:05:52,577 --> 01:05:54,977
今でも
Even now,

1129
01:05:54,977 --> 01:05:59,777
あなたは美しいのだから
because you are beautiful.

1130
01:06:01,077 --> 01:06:03,477
Must be something surreal

1131
01:06:03,477 --> 01:06:05,877
and listless dream we can’t heal

1132
01:06:05,877 --> 01:06:08,477
This rusty world wound up real

1133
01:06:08,477 --> 01:06:13,377
Still want to love the way it feels

1134
01:06:13,877 --> 01:06:18,377
May not the city feels that sure, but like

1135
01:06:18,377 --> 01:06:22,977
the lights and sights and sounds are treasures.

1136
01:06:23,677 --> 01:06:26,477
こんな世界に
In a world like this,

1137
01:06:26,477 --> 01:06:29,377
抗って歩く
fighting as I walk,

1138
01:06:29,377 --> 01:06:32,277
力なんて
such power,

1139
01:06:32,277 --> 01:06:37,377
私にはないけど
I don't have it, but...

1140
01:06:39,277 --> 01:06:40,977
Face up this world

1141
01:06:40,977 --> 01:06:43,377
can’t kill that peace

1142
01:06:43,377 --> 01:06:45,777
So why don’t we turn this scuffed up page

1143
01:06:45,777 --> 01:06:48,577
We’re writing in

1144
01:06:48,577 --> 01:06:52,377
こんな世界じゃ
In a world like this,

1145
01:06:52,677 --> 01:06:54,377
Be real I think we know

1146
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:57,077
この夜明けは is rarely fair
this dawn is rarely fair

1147
01:06:57,077 --> 01:06:59,777
Decide your fate

1148
01:06:59,777 --> 01:07:00,777
だから
So,

1149
01:07:00,777 --> 01:07:05,477
あなたを放してしまわないで
don't ever let go of yourself.

1150
01:07:05,777 --> 01:07:07,477
Hey

1151
01:07:07,477 --> 01:07:09,177
Tomorrow’s a brand new day

1152
01:07:09,177 --> 01:07:11,177
Like all those mistakes

1153
01:07:11,177 --> 01:07:14,377
Pass through this rather ruthless… it might be

1154
01:07:14,377 --> 01:07:16,177
Rain the question is

1155
01:07:16,177 --> 01:07:17,277
Will you bear that pain?

1156
01:07:17,277 --> 01:07:19,277
What’s your reason on the stage?

1157
01:07:19,277 --> 01:07:21,977
This shining world let us stray

1158
01:07:21,977 --> 01:07:24,477
Won't leave it all to decay

1159
01:07:24,477 --> 01:07:29,077
I choose to love it anyway

1160
01:07:30,277 --> 01:07:36,677
Oh-oh-oh...

1161
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:38,277
We choose to know

1162
01:07:38,277 --> 01:07:40,677
the struggles of this scuffed up

1163
01:07:40,677 --> 01:07:43,377
page we live in

1164
01:07:44,377 --> 01:07:49,177
So don’t give in
