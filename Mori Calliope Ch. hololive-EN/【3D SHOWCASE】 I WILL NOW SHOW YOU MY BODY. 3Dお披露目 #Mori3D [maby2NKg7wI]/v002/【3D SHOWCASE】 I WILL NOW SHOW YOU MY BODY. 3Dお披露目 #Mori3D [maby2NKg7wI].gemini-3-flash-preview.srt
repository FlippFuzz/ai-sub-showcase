00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,950
Am frog.

5
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,150
ほっ！皆さん！調子どうですか？
Ho! Everyone! How are you doing?

6
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,700
How are you?!

7
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,600
It's time!

8
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,200
It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time, it's time!

9
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,200
Everybody, hello!

10
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,350
I'm Mori Calliope from hololive English -Myth-,

11
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,950
and welcome to the Underworld!

12
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,150
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

13
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,200
I have many things to show you!

14
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,600
Check it out!

15
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,150
Check out my stage!

16
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,200
行くぞ！
Let's go!

17
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,200
Check it out, look at the skulls with the wings in the background,

18
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,300
and oh man, this...

19
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,850
this is the best venue in the Underworld.

20
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,050
You know it.

21
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,550
You know that this is the place to be.

22
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,100
Check it out.

23
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,200
Hey, look at that!

24
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,200
Look at all the Dead Beats in the crowd swinging the lights.

25
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,200
They're like "woo-woo-woo-woo-woo"!

26
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,000
And it's on fire!

27
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:03,533
Wow! すごいな！ Check out the big speakers too.
Wow! It's amazing! Check out the big speakers too.

28
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,533
Yo, that's actually dope. Thanks, glad you think so.

29
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:10,533
That's me! Correct, that is you.

30
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:14,033
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you.

31
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:18,033
And you, and you. That's kind of hot, not gonna lie.

32
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:23,033
Correct, correct. It's a little hot in here, but we're about to make it hotter.

33
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:27,533
Because, guess what you guys, this, this before your eyes...

34
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:31,533
...is not just a regular place to chill. No, no, no, no, no.

35
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:34,533
We have performances. Performances, action, romance...

36
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:39,533
...maybe not romance, but lots of, lots of performances. So get ready.

37
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:44,533
And thank you for the many congratulations, you guys. All right.

38
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:49,033
Now, now, for the first performance I want to do...

39
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:52,033
...I have something special to show you.

40
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:55,533
Check it out. Oh, it's over here.

41
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:58,533
I gotta go grab... I gotta go grab it really quick. Hold on.

42
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:02,033
I'm getting it. It's now in my hand. Okay.

43
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:05,533
Just so you know, it's... it's in my hands now. Staff-san, staff-san, it's here.

44
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,033
The first song that we're singing today is Wanted, Wasted.

45
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:13,033
Let's go.

46
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:23,033
Wanted, Wasted

47
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:31,033
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh...

50
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:34,533
Guess who's the reaper, turn it back around, going looking deep inside for the truth to exploit.

51
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:40,533
You know I smoke 'em, I smoke 'em, I smoke 'em, I dye 'em, I smoke 'em, drive me crazy, ah!

52
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,533
Wanted, Wasted, start looking twice, can't, can't stop falling down.

53
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:47,033
Tell me how mortals show you where the dirt is. One man's trash is another man's purpose.

54
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:50,033
Stay won't fly high, come tomorrow, fucking die. Stop trash, choking, why? Nothing I own's true mine.

55
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:57,033
I started... 愛の無い夢を見てるのは何故? Whoa-oh-oh...
I started... why am I having a dream without love? Whoa-oh-oh...

56
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:00,433
When I wanna be loved but I can't be seen.

57
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:04,233
変えたい現実も、泣き叫ぶ訳も、響き渡る...
Both the reality I want to change and the reason for crying out, they echo out...

58
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:09,533
やっちゃって、やっちゃって、やっちゃって、そのままずっと狂い咲いちゃって...
Do it, do it, do it, just like that, bloom madly forever...

59
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:13,033
聴いて売るギル、バッド・エンディング、縁から目出す悩み...
Hear and sell guilt, bad ending, worries emerging from the edge...

60
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,533
終わそう、そうあそ、そう、とっくに仕上げて頂戴。整合性、正々堂々、正義の名のもと...
Finish it, yeah, finish it already. Consistency, fair and square, in the name of justice...

61
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:20,033
下してやるも、ゲーム・メーカー、アンダーテイカー、脳天直下、喰らえ！
I'll strike it down, game maker, undertaker, straight to the brain, take this!

62
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,033
Oh-oh-oh, 響き、Mayday, Mayday...
Oh-oh-oh, echoing, Mayday, Mayday...

63
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:29,533
鳴らす...
Ring it...

64
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,033
聴こえないふりして逃げられると思ってんの？ クソ！
Do you think you can escape by pretending you can't hear? Shit!

65
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:37,033
Why am I having the dream? I started... 愛の無い夢を見てるのは何故? Whoa-oh-oh...
Why am I having the dream? I started... why am I having a dream without love? Whoa-oh-oh...

66
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:40,033
Where I wanna be loved but I can't be seen.

67
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:44,033
変えたい現実も、泣き叫ぶ訳も、響き渡る...
Both the reality I want to change and the reason for crying out, they echo out...

68
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:48,033
不埒な声で、喘ぐ声は、天国に近づく気がしてた。Alright.
With an outrageous voice, the gasping voice felt like it was approaching heaven. Alright.

69
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:57,033
本来の反逆、狂おしく舞い上がってしまえ！
Original rebellion, dance up madly!

70
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:03,533
Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God.

71
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:10,033
Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God.

72
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,533
傷つけちゃって...
Getting hurt...

73
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,533
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh...

74
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,533
足りない、足りない、足りない、カルマ。
Not enough, not enough, not enough, karma.

75
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:21,033
Loading...

76
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,533
あぁ、もう絶対どうにかしておく魂。
Ah, the soul I'll definitely do something about.

77
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:28,033
I'm nothin' about this mess. I started... 愛の無い夢を見てるのは何故? Whoa-oh-oh...
I'm nothin' about this mess. I started... why am I having a dream without love? Whoa-oh-oh...

78
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:31,033
Where I wanna be loved but I can't be seen.

79
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:35,033
変えたい現実も、泣き叫ぶ訳も、響き渡る...
Both the reality I want to change and the reason for crying out, they echo out...

80
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:41,033
不埒な声で、喘ぐ声は、天国に近づく気がしてた。Alright.
With an outrageous voice, the gasping voice felt like it was approaching heaven. Alright.

81
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:49,033
本来の反逆、狂おしく舞い上がってしまえ！
Original rebellion, dance up madly!

82
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:54,533
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh...

83
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,533
足りない、足りない、足りない、足りない。
Not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough.

84
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:03,033
足りない、足りない、足りない、足りない。
Not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough.

85
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:06,533
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh...

86
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:09,533
足りない、足りない、足りない、足りない。
Not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough.

87
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:15,533
足りない、足りない、足りない、足りない。
Not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough.

88
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,533
Wanted, Wasted.

89
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:21,033
Thank you. Thank you so much everyone!

90
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:25,033
Whoo, look at them go. But it's not over yet.

91
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:30,033
Because now, I've got another song to sing.

92
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:33,033
This one's called NEZUMI Scheme.

93
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,033
Here we go.

94
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:39,533
NEZUMI Scheme

95
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:41,533
All right, all right! Hey! Hey!

96
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:43,033
English lyrics by Mori Calliope

97
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:45,033
Let's go! Come on everybody!

98
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:46,533
Music by FAKE TYPE.

Arranged by DYES IWASAKI / Japanese lyrics by TOPHAMHAT-KYO

100
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:50,033
Put your hands up! Yeah, yeah, hey!

101
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:54,033
That's my debt, came up the rat race, cat chasing dumb and fall, but the kingdom of swingdom is open to all.

102
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:58,033
Enter the game, it's a place to make a profit, rabbit swing is the thing now, more for you to scoff it.

103
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,033
Look, boys and girls...

104
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,395
Poison Hades, underrated girl born to hate it.

105
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:03,145
Shout out to any crazy people still in the empire.

106
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:06,195
Just wanna set fire, I'm wishing I went higher!

107
00:10:06,195 --> 00:10:08,045
冷え切ったスピーカー
Chilled speakers

108
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:10,045
聞く耳なんてない奴ばかりだろ
Most people don't even listen

109
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:15,545
似て非なる自信、自惚れ
Confidence and hubris, similar but not the same

110
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:17,345
紙一重 恐れおののけ
The line is fine, be afraid of this

111
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:23,395
奢って、吹聴、自縛、困窮
Gilded, boastful, self-bound, destitute

112
00:10:23,395 --> 00:10:25,145
逆に振って 張り倒して
Swing the other way, knock them down

113
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:26,945
ハロー Staff-san ok?
Hello staff-san? Step-up ok?

114
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:28,945
Step-up ok?

115
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:31,245
逆の目 逆の目
The other eye, the other eye

116
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:33,445
しゃらくせえ
Shut up your drivel.

117
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:35,345
所在無さそうね
Know your place.

118
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:39,545
ボロ儲けして 塗りがかった 綺麗なネズミ
You fake making cheddar, you rat!

119
00:10:40,345 --> 00:10:43,745
香水 振りまいても 消えないわ その悪臭
No amount of perfume can kill the stench of your cheese.

120
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:46,045
What's it all for? You a skeptic?

121
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,845
Those opinions kind of septic.

122
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:49,145
You're my minions...

123
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:51,645
No, wait, my biggest fans! Internet business women drawing up ten plans.

124
00:10:51,645 --> 00:10:53,345
Why you trying to pin me for a pyramid scheme?

125
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:55,245
I refuse to be a part of any derelict dreams.

126
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:57,045
Swipe over and hear the screams, and they say us...

127
00:10:57,045 --> 00:10:59,045
...basically gotta get to saying those prayers.

128
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:01,345
転ばぬ先の杖
Better safe than sorry

129
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:03,145
持っちゃいない 向こう側のドア
I don't have it, the door on the other side

130
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,145
You've got nothing going for you!

131
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:09,045
似て非なる自信、自惚れ
Confidence and hubris, similar but not the same

132
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:10,945
紙一重 恐れおののけ
The line is fine, be afraid of this

133
00:11:13,345 --> 00:11:15,145
奢って、吹聴、自縛、困窮
Gilded, boastful, self-bound, destitute

134
00:11:15,145 --> 00:11:17,045
逆に振って 張り倒して
Swing the other way, knock them down

135
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:19,045
ハロー Staff-san ok? Step-up ok?
Hello staff-san? Step-up ok?

136
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:23,745
勘違いしてる奴らばかり うざい
Everyone's getting it wrong, it's annoying

137
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:25,545
決してあんたの方は向かない 秤
The scales will never tip in your direction

138
00:11:28,945 --> 00:11:32,445
あんたの知らせは まだまだ臭い
Your information is still way too fishy

139
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:35,445
刈り取るまでもない 拙い話は Bye
Your petty stories aren't even worth reaping, bye

140
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,845
御山の天狗を 並べた鼻で笑お
Let's laugh at the 'Great Tengu of the Mountain' and their big noses

141
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:43,345
虎の威を借る 爆速できるならやってごらん
Borrowing the tiger's authority, try it if you can do it at top speed

142
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,445
全然足りない 其の走辞も頻くはならない
Not enough at all, even that rhetoric won't be frequent

143
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:50,645

I have something important to introduce to you.

My Dead Beat backup dancers, Gaikotsu-chan!

165
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:48,545

Look at Mr. and Mrs. Bones.

172
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:06,245
Wow, thank you so much for coming!

173
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,745
See you later! Bye-bye!

174
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:10,345
いいね！
Nice!

175
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:12,145
Man, I'm already worn out from that...

176
00:13:12,145 --> 00:13:14,245
...but it was so cool to dance together with my skeletons.

177
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:16,845
Y'all look cute, thank you very much.

178
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:18,545
They did a great job.

179
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:20,145
I'm glad that you agree.

180
00:13:20,145 --> 00:13:22,545
I'm glad that you're vibing.

181
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:25,845
No, Mr. Bones, oh it's okay, Mr. and Mrs. Bones...

182
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:28,445
...they may come back. I don't know.

183
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:30,845
But for now, I do know that I need to...

184
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:33,245
...I need to chill for a second.

185
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:37,445
You know, there's one thing that I always really kind of wanted to do.

186
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:41,745
And that was, drink a nice glass of wine during my 3D.

187
00:13:41,745 --> 00:13:44,845
I don't really drink wine very much anymore...

188
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:47,345
...but I told myself that I would.

189
00:13:47,345 --> 00:13:51,845
For this special momentous occasion, right?

190
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:54,345
So that's what I'm going to do!

191
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:58,245
And the team here at the Great Jigoku Theater...

192
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:02,445
...decided to set up something special for me.

193
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:05,545
My own little wine tasting corner.

194
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:10,745
Rise!

195
00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:12,645
Very nice!

196
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:15,545
There it is, ladies and gentlemen, check it out!

197
00:14:15,545 --> 00:14:19,445
My own little special corner for the tasting of the wine.

198
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:22,245
It's got a bunch of different types of wine...

199
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:24,445
...but I chose the most...

200
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:28,845
I found the cheapest one at the convenience store to try for today.

201
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:32,445
So, this is where we're going to be enjoying some time together.

202
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:34,545
よいしょ、よいしょ...
Heave-ho, heave-ho...

203
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:36,545
Are you guys ready?

204
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:38,245
Swank, very fancy.

205
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:40,445
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

206
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:42,345
Well, I guess it's time.

207
00:14:42,345 --> 00:14:46,445
Oh, staff-san got the wine bottle ready for me.

208
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:51,245
Alright, well, let me go ahead and grab this and okay.

209
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:55,245
Well, everybody, should we have a cheers?

210
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:58,545
Box wine? No, no, no, not box wine, not quite.

211
00:14:58,545 --> 00:15:00,045
It's...

212
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:01,357
convenience store wine.

213
00:15:01,357 --> 00:15:03,857
I asked staff-san to get me the cheapest one.

214
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:05,457
Hydrate up!

215
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:06,357
Thanks, Watson.

216
00:15:06,357 --> 00:15:08,557
This will definitely keep me hydrated.

217
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:11,357
Not like I just had a ton of coffee before this or anything,

218
00:15:11,357 --> 00:15:12,757
but here we go.

219
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:14,857
乾杯しましょう。
Let's have a toast.

220
00:15:14,857 --> 00:15:16,157
Are you guys ready?

221
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:18,157
You ready for a cheers, everyone? Everyone at home?

222
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:20,457
Calliope fancy-pants Mori.

223
00:15:20,457 --> 00:15:21,857
What can I say?

224
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:27,257
お、いいね。いいね。外国勢も乾杯したいね。いいね。
Oh, nice. Nice. The overseas guys want to toast too. Nice.

225
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:28,557
Alright, well let's cheers!

226
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:30,357
乾杯！
Cheers!

227
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:32,857
To 3D for Myth!

228
00:15:36,757 --> 00:15:40,857
Oh man, that does taste like convenience store wine.

00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:44,057
コンビニワイン。うん、間違いないね。

No doubt about it.

231
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:51,557
Ah, sometimes you just gotta loosen up, deadbeats.

232
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:53,657
Sometimes you just gotta loosen up.

233
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:55,757
You know, here, I wonder...

234
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:58,757
While I'm here drinking this wine, maybe you can

235
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,357

251
00:16:40,557 --> 00:16:43,757
I would like to try drinking an even cheaper wine,

252
00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:46,057

But I have to finish this glass. I have to. I promised myself that I would.

262
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:11,857
I was inspired by, by Lamy-senpai.

263
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:15,557
Lamy-senpai got to drink sake, nihonshu I think, nihonshu it was,

264
00:17:15,557 --> 00:17:18,557
on stream for her 3D debut. So I figured I'm going to do the same.

265
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:22,557
As one of the only alcohol-okay members of EN.

266
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:32,457
Ah, let's see what chat has to say. 'Kawaii'.

267
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:34,557
Oh, 'wami', 'wami', 'wami'.

268
00:17:34,557 --> 00:17:38,057
Based. Lamy's great. Yeah.

269
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:41,057
Where's the 'gah'?

270
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:43,657
Chat, you're right. Hold on, hold on. I got you, I got you.

271
00:17:43,657 --> 00:17:46,057
Alright listen, よく聞いて。

かあー！
Gah!

273
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:56,557

274
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:02,557
かあー！
Gah!

275
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:05,157
That one had a bit of a different tone to it.

276
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:07,457
Alright, done with the wine.

277
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:09,057
ワイン終わりです。
Wine is finished.

278
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:12,157
I can't, I can't do too much because, you know, we have stuff to do.

279
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:14,257
Oh, hey!

280
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:16,257

281
00:18:16,257 --> 00:18:18,457

Oh, who's a good deadbeat? You're a good deadbeat.

可愛いね。
Cute, isn't it.

294
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:52,357
What... what's that? What's that, deadbeat? You want me to step on you?

295
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:55,257
Oh gosh, okay. Hold on, hold on.

296
00:18:55,757 --> 00:18:57,857

00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,557
I have my scythe.

303
00:19:20,557 --> 00:19:23,057
My scythe, my... what is it?

304
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:26,557
Well, I have... I have my big, my big scythe. You know, Ricky, right?

305
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:29,257
But I have something else I want to show you. Yeah.

I have something else too. A special one.

307
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:35,857
An instrument. You saw it before. Hold on, I'm going to go grab it again, okay?

308
00:19:35,857 --> 00:19:39,557
You stay right there. Stay right there.

309
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:41,557
I'm going to go get the scythe.

310
00:19:46,557 --> 00:19:48,357
Ah, I got it! I got it, I got it!

311
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:50,057
Everyone, look! It's the scythe-bass!

312
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:52,357
Pretty cool, right? ほら見て。
Pretty cool, right? Look at this.

313
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,557
めっちゃ素敵ですね。
It's really wonderful, isn't it.

314
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:57,057
You can play it, of course.

315
00:19:58,557 --> 00:20:00,057
I'm, I'm messing around.

316
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:01,369
But but...

317
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:03,269
you don't only have to play it.

318
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,269
No, no, no.

319
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,569
You can use it as a weapon if you want.

320
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:07,569
ちょっと見て。
Watch this.

321
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:09,269
I'll show you, I'll show you, okay?

322
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:10,569
I've been training a lot, so...

323
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:12,069
Okay, get this stance perfect...

324
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:20,069
Downstroke! Uppercut!

325
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:21,069
And... 回り！
And... spin!

326
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:24,069
Heh! And back around! Ha!

327
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:26,569
いい感じですね。
Feels pretty good.

328
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:28,069
Isn't it cool?

329
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:29,069
Look at it!

330
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:31,069
It has multiple purposes!

331
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:34,069
But but, did you know back in the day,

332
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:36,069
farmers used to use the scythe

333
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,069
to harvest the crops and the grass,

334
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:41,069
cut the grass like this. Yeah?

335
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:43,069
That was the original use of the scythe.

336
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:45,569
And then us reapers decided

337
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:47,569
that it was such a waste of a great tool

338
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:50,069
to not use them to take people's lives,

339
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:52,069
as a... murder weapon. Yeah.

340
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:54,869
Aw, look at the little Deadbeat playing!

341
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:56,569
He's having so much fun!

342
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:58,269
Aw, look at how cute.

343
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:00,069
Alright, so as I was saying,

344
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:02,069
this is usually how we reap the superchats

345
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:04,069
and the souls and stuff like that

346
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:07,069
down in the fields. We kind of do a similar thing

347
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:09,069
to what the farmers used to do back in the day.

348
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:09,769
What... huh?

349
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:10,569
何してるの？
What are you doing?

350
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,869
Deadbeat, what are you doing?

351
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:12,769
怪しい。
Suspicious.

352
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:14,069
What's this? Oh!

353
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:16,069
Are you stealing the superchats?!

354
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:19,069
Hey! おいおいおい、Deadbeat, stop!
Hey! Hey hey hey, Deadbeat, stop!

355
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:21,069
スパチャ盗んでる！
He's stealing superchats!

356
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:21,869
マジか？
Seriously?

357
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:23,869
Hey, wait! No no no, not that!

358
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:26,569
Wait! That's my scythe!

359
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:28,069
勘弁して！
Give me a break!

360
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:31,569
Wait a minute. I can fight back!

361
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:34,069
You want to fight me, Deadbeat?

362
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:35,569
Alright. That's fine.

363
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:38,269
You do know who you're dealing with, right though?

364
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:41,569
I am the Grim Reaper's first apprentice.

365
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:44,269
Okay then! If it's a fight you want...

366
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,069
it's a fight you'll get! Come on!

367
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:58,069
Got it! Yeah!

368
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:00,069
That's what you get.

369
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:06,869
ふざけんな！
Stop messing around!

370
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:08,569
まだ生きてる？ He's still alive!
Still alive? He's still alive!

371
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:11,069
おいおい、that's not funny, Deadbeat.
Hey hey, that's not funny, Deadbeat.

372
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:13,569
Stop laughing at me!

373
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:16,069
We're gonna have to use more than just weaponry

374
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,569
to get back at this Deadbeat.

375
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,569
Okay fine, fine, fine, fine.

376
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:21,569
We'll figure something else out.

377
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:24,069
Until then, come at me!

378
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:27,569
Hah! Ha! Uppercut! Uppercut!

379
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:29,069
Come on now!

380
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:34,069
He really knows how to use a scythe!

381
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:37,069
Oh gosh! Ha! Stop, Deadbeat!

382
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:40,569
Come on now! Back off!

383
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:42,069
邪魔！
Back off!

384
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,069
Let's finish this!

385
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:53,069
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

386
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:59,069
Let's go! Get Morivated! Woo!

387
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:19,069
Woo! Yeah, baby! Burn, baby, burn!

388
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:24,069
Burnt so many evil skeletons.

389
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,569
But who's gonna help me enjoy my 3D now?

390
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:31,069
Those guys were my backup dancers, camera crew...

391
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:34,069
I didn't think they'd get so money hungry and rowdy.

392
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:38,069
Oh, will you guys hang out with me?

393
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:47,069
My friends are here!

394
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:50,069
My friends came to party, everyone!

395
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:53,069
As you expected, I've got my buddies here!

396
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:57,069
My Myth friends! They came to hang out with me.

397
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:02,069
So, I guess it's time to do Myth-related things!

398
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:07,069
Come on, come on! Come on now!

399
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:09,569
Come on out, friends!

400
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:12,269
But here's the catch: You can't see them.

401
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:16,069
They're invisible. They're invisible... I think.

402
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:19,069
Where's the... where's the camera?

403
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:21,069
They're going to be my camera people.

404
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:24,569
Well, I have... I have two camera guests today.

405
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:29,569
Come on over! We've got Ninomae Ina'nis is here!

406
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,569
I can't believe I've died!

407
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:33,569
They're so...

408
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:36,569
Ame-chan, help me! I'm dying!

409
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:40,069
And Ame! Ame's here too!

410
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:41,869
You can't see them though.

411
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:44,569
They're mysterious spirits drifting in...

412
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:48,569
in the wilderness of the Underworld. Hi!

413
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:50,569
And you've got the camera now!

414
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:54,069
You've got all the power! All the power.

415
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:57,069
So, they're going to help me get the best angles.

416
00:24:57,069 --> 00:24:59,569
And then I think we have Kiwawa and Gura in here, yeah?

417
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,281
Who are those?

418
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:03,581
Yay! Hello!

419
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:07,081
Go to the left! Go to the right!

420
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:10,081
Look at that! What's this?

421
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:13,081
We can go home after this, right Calli?

422
00:25:13,081 --> 00:25:15,581
Well, we'll talk about that a little bit later.

423
00:25:17,581 --> 00:25:22,581
So I got to say, I'm worried about Kiara,
your voice sounds like it's dying.

424
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:26,581
Yeah, because of your sick-ass performance!

425
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:29,081
Whoa! Oh yeah!

426
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:31,581
You ripped my voice.

427
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:34,581
Can you stop ripping my voice, please?

428
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:36,081
No!

429
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:37,081
No!

430
00:25:37,081 --> 00:25:38,081
Won't do that.

431
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:41,581
What do you guys think of this? This crazy stage.

432
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,081
It's on fire!

433
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:45,081
It is on fire. Literally.

434
00:25:45,081 --> 00:25:46,581
Bring down the house.

435
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:48,081
Look at the audience!

436
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:50,081
Ina's on the camera!

437
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,581
Yeah, Ina's on the camera now.

438
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:54,081
Ina's in control.

439
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:55,581
Ina's in control.

440
00:25:55,581 --> 00:26:00,081
Alright, well, we're gonna hold that thought,
and Ame, what do you want me to do?

441
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:05,081
You first, you know what I'm going to ask.

442
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:06,581
I do?

443
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:09,081
Are you going to ask me to do the worm?

444
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:14,581
Do the worm! Do it! Do it! Do the worm!

445
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:16,581
You know what? Alright, here's the thing.

446
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:19,581
I'm going to do it to prove it can be done.

447
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:21,081
Okay? Ina? Ina?

448
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:24,581
No, you put that camera... Wait, wait, wait.

449
00:26:24,581 --> 00:26:26,581
I have one advice, Calli.
I have one piece of advice, Calli.

450
00:26:26,581 --> 00:26:31,581
How about, if it's difficult for you,
the worm, how you normally push yourself up...

451
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:35,081
You can bounce yourself off of your boobies.

452
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:38,081
What the f-?

453
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:45,581
Really? You want to... かんべんして.
I want to fucking かんべんして.
Really? You want to... Give me a break.
I want to fucking give me a break.

454
00:26:46,581 --> 00:26:47,581
Okay, alright, alright, let's go.

455
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:50,081
Alright, I can do this. Hold on.

456
00:26:50,081 --> 00:26:51,581
No, I'm strong.

457
00:26:51,581 --> 00:26:53,081
Hey, you saw me lift this scythe.

458
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:54,581
Alright, hold on. No, it's the worm. Let's go.

459
00:26:54,581 --> 00:26:57,081
Good form! Do the worm!

460
00:27:08,081 --> 00:27:11,081
She's worming! Oh my god, she's worming!

461
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:14,581
My back hurts. Okay, okay.

462
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:16,581
Now see if you can get up.

463
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:18,581
Oi, oi, oi!

464
00:27:18,581 --> 00:27:20,581
I'm gonna get you for this.

465
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:21,581
Our payback!

466
00:27:21,581 --> 00:27:24,081
Wait, what? What?
Hey, this is only the beginning here, you see.

467
00:27:24,081 --> 00:27:29,081
Okay, Kiara, do you have any requests?
Yes, excuse me, excuse me, ma'am.

468
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:32,081
No, no, not you, you're the camera person.

469
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:35,081
Okay, okay, fine. Watson is in control.

470
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:38,081
What is your request, Kiara?

471
00:27:38,081 --> 00:27:49,081
Eh, so I want something cute,
and can you please do the Caramelldansen dance...

472
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:51,581
I do. I do. You're taking me way back.

473
00:27:51,581 --> 00:27:54,581
Alright, here we go.

474
00:27:54,581 --> 00:27:59,081
And then full body and also close up,
please, camera. Both, both.

475
00:27:59,081 --> 00:28:02,081
Both? That's an impossible request, client!

476
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:04,581
That is a tall order. I guess a zoom in.

477
00:28:04,581 --> 00:28:07,081
However you see fit to do it, Watson.

478
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:09,081
Okay, okay, I shall move in.

479
00:28:09,081 --> 00:28:11,081
Okay. This is the... boing boing. I'll just say.

480
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:20,081
This is gonna get me DMCA'd.
It's the Caramelldansen.

481
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:22,081
It's okay, we'll fix it in post.

482
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:25,081
Let me do it more intense. It's like this.

483
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:34,581
You guys are gonna tire me out before the end.
Oi, oi, oi.

484
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:38,081
Is it my turn? Is it my turn?
Okay, Gura, what's your request?

485
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:40,081
Cartwheel.

486
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:41,081
What was that? Cartwheel?

487
00:28:41,081 --> 00:28:42,581
Cartwheel.

488
00:28:42,581 --> 00:28:44,581
Are you... are you kidding me?

489
00:28:44,581 --> 00:28:48,081
Let's go! Do it! Do it!

490
00:28:48,081 --> 00:28:51,081
Can she do it? Let's see. This is dangerous.

491
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:53,581
I'm trying to get you in. Let's go.

492
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:56,581
Cartwheel! Let's go! Cartwheel!

493
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:58,581
Alright, here we go.

494
00:28:58,581 --> 00:29:00,081
She's doing it!

495
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:07,581
Come on, man! Okay, okay.

496
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:10,581
That wasn't bad. Action roll!

497
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:11,581
Action roll?

498
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:12,581
Yeah!

499
00:29:12,581 --> 00:29:14,581
Protect your spine.

500
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:17,581
That was the action roll.

501
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:19,581
Oh, I thought you wanted another one.

502
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:24,581
Alright... well, I guess that's it for all the requests...

503
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:27,581
No! No!

504
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:30,081
Alright, alright. What do you want me to do, Ina?

505
00:29:30,081 --> 00:29:33,081
Watson's turn on the camera.

506
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:35,081
Alright, Calli...

507
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:36,581
Wait, Calli. What?

508
00:29:36,581 --> 00:29:40,081
I want you to give us the most cutest...

509
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:41,581
Wait, why are you turning around?

510
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:43,581
I'm scared. Why are you turning around?

511
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:46,581
No! Why are you turning around? Leave me be, woman!

512
00:29:46,581 --> 00:29:48,581
Why are you running? Why are you running?

513
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:51,081
Leave me be! No, no, no. やだ!
Leave me be! No, no, no. No way!

514
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:54,081
Okay, okay, okay.

515
00:29:54,081 --> 00:30:00,081
I want you to give us the most cutest...

516
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,218
もえもえきゅん！
Moe moe kyun!

517
00:30:01,293 --> 00:30:02,193
うわー！
Whoa!

518
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:05,513
Thank you for coming to Kawa-P Mori's 3D!

519
00:30:05,593 --> 00:30:06,493
アイ、アイ！
Aye-aye!

520
00:30:06,713 --> 00:30:08,643
It's time to... You can't run away!

521
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:10,593
You can't run away!

522
00:30:08,693 --> 00:30:10,593
You can't run away!

523
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:12,543
Moe moe kyun?

524
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:15,643
Yeah, full body, put your heart into it.

525
00:30:15,693 --> 00:30:17,593
Come on! Come on, you can do it!

526
00:30:17,643 --> 00:30:19,543
We've been waiting for years!

527
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:21,593
Do you want to cause the entirety of

528
00:30:21,593 --> 00:30:23,093
these skeletons to cringe so hard

529
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:24,043
they die a second time?

530
00:30:24,093 --> 00:30:26,593
Oh, step it up! It's on fire!

531
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:26,993
Might as well put out the fire with some...

532
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:28,593
With some, you know, embarrassment,

533
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:31,043
second-hand embarrassment.

534
00:30:31,093 --> 00:30:33,493
With tears of joy from the Dead Beats.

535
00:30:33,593 --> 00:30:35,843
Is this really what you want, Dead Beats?

536
00:30:35,893 --> 00:30:37,593
Let's look at chat.

537
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:39,593
Chat, is this really what you want?

538
00:30:39,643 --> 00:30:41,593
They're saying yes! They're saying yes!

539
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:43,093
Go, Calli! Go!

540
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:45,093
Just do it!

541
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,593
Just do it!

542
00:30:46,593 --> 00:30:48,593
Just do it! Go!

543
00:30:49,043 --> 00:30:50,393
Alright, fine.

544
00:30:50,443 --> 00:30:51,543
Kawai-P...

545
00:30:51,593 --> 00:30:53,493
Let me think about the choreography.

546
00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:55,393
Okay, she's thinking, she's thinking.

547
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:02,393
Ina's the spin master!

548
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:04,093
Alright, what's the best camera

549
00:31:04,093 --> 00:31:05,193
in this world, for real?

550
00:31:05,243 --> 00:31:06,793
She's like a pro, for real.

551
00:31:07,043 --> 00:31:08,593
Alright, start from here.

552
00:31:08,643 --> 00:31:09,593
Oh, cute!

553
00:31:09,643 --> 00:31:11,043
Alright, we can do a little...

554
00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:13,993
Oh, Kawai-P! Okay.

555
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:16,943
Alright, here I go. Here I go.

556
00:31:16,993 --> 00:31:18,493
もえ...
Moe...

557
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,093
もえ...
Moe...

558
00:31:20,143 --> 00:31:23,093
きゅん！
Kyun!

559
00:31:23,143 --> 00:31:25,893
うわー！
Whoa!

560
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:25,893
You sons of...!

561
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:27,543
It's all your fault! It's all your fault!

562
00:31:27,593 --> 00:31:31,043
This is the Dead Beats' diet. No...

563
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:33,093
It was good! It was good!

564
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:34,993
Cute! Oh, look at that face!

565
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:38,093
Oh, give me that face... Oh, this is...

566
00:31:38,093 --> 00:31:41,093
Okay... Cute!

567
00:31:41,143 --> 00:31:43,093
Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

568
00:31:43,093 --> 00:31:44,293
Is that gonna get me banned? What?

569
00:31:44,343 --> 00:31:46,093
What? Wait a minute.

570
00:31:46,093 --> 00:31:47,943
Looking at those nice shoes. Ooh.

571
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:49,093
Very nice, right?

572
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:50,643
You want to give everybody a full body look?

573
00:31:50,693 --> 00:31:52,593
Yes! From bottom to top scan!

574
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:54,543
Scan it!

575
00:31:54,593 --> 00:31:56,593
What did we say in the rehearsal?

576
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:58,393
You gotta what? Show the what?

577
00:31:58,443 --> 00:32:00,643
Show the what? What'd you say, Ina?

578
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:02,093
Get in the slit!

579
00:32:02,093 --> 00:32:03,043
"Get in the slit" is what she said.

580
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:04,743
I did not!

581
00:32:04,793 --> 00:32:06,093
Yeah, you did!

582
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:07,593
We're exposing you now, okay?

583
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:08,593
I did not!

584
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:10,093
Oh, hi Dead Beats.

585
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:11,293
Hello, Dead Beats. You know what you're doing.

586
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:12,593
I did not! Alright...

587
00:32:12,593 --> 00:32:14,043
I did not!

588
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:16,343
Do you have any up-close things you guys want to see?

589
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,593
Ooh! Your eyeballs!

590
00:32:18,593 --> 00:32:21,043
I mean, your pupils! Eyeballs!

591
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:22,593
How close can we get?

592
00:32:22,593 --> 00:32:24,093
Eyes. Eyes. Strange things.

593
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:26,593
Oh, cute! Oh, close!

594
00:32:26,593 --> 00:32:29,043
Oh, gloss! Glossy! Sorry.

595
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:31,043
Hello. I think we saw your brain.

596
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:34,043
Oh, really? It wasn't very big, was it?

597
00:32:34,093 --> 00:32:36,093
I don't know, we're gonna have to check...

598
00:32:36,093 --> 00:32:38,043
Yeah, check the video.

599
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:41,043
Ina, why are you doing that with the camera?

600
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:43,093
What the...?! Why are you...?!

601
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:46,043
Oh, my...! Oh, yeah, Ina...

602
00:32:46,093 --> 00:32:48,593
Why are you getting so weird with the camera right now?

603
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:50,043
Ina!

604
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,093
It's for me!

605
00:32:52,093 --> 00:32:54,043
Oh, you know what? This is for Watame-senpai!

606
00:32:54,093 --> 00:32:55,593
Oh, 脇ピー!
Oh, Waki-P!

607
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:58,093
Let me kind of pretend to be Watame...

608
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,043
Alright, Watame-senpai impression.

609
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:04,043
わきわき？
Armpit-armpit?

610
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:06,093
わきわき？
Armpit-armpit?

611
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:09,043
いいな。これ。先輩大好き！
Nice. This. I love you, Senpai!

612
00:33:09,093 --> 00:33:11,093
You good, Ina?

613
00:33:11,093 --> 00:33:14,043
You good, bro? Bro.

614
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:16,593
Here's the other one. For Watame-senpai.

615
00:33:16,643 --> 00:33:19,043
How do they compare?

616
00:33:19,043 --> 00:33:21,043
This is Watame-senpai's property.

617
00:33:21,093 --> 00:33:23,593
Left side, right side.

618
00:33:23,593 --> 00:33:26,043
(Waki song/humming)

619
00:33:26,093 --> 00:33:28,093
脇ピー, Watame...
Waki-P, Watame...

620
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:30,043
I wonder. Hold up.

621
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:32,093
I'm sorry.

622
00:33:32,193 --> 00:33:34,593
Oh, sick! They amped up the...

623
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:36,593
Here we go! Here we go!

624
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:38,093
I have no heart.

625
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:41,043
ほら見て、船長。見て。
Look at this, Captain. Look.

626
00:33:41,093 --> 00:33:43,093
船長、見て。
Captain, look.

627
00:33:43,143 --> 00:33:46,043
Oh my god! I've seen this before somewhere.

628
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:48,093
あほーい！
Ahoy!

629
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,093
あほーい！
Ahoy!

630
00:33:50,093 --> 00:33:51,593
Like you're on a trampoline!

631
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:54,093
See, now I'm having fun,

632
00:33:54,143 --> 00:33:56,593
now that you guys aren't puppeteering me

633
00:33:56,593 --> 00:33:58,043
like evil geniuses.

634
00:33:58,093 --> 00:34:00,093
Wait... I just realized,

635
00:34:00,093 --> 00:34:03,043
I have... I have some power here.

636
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:06,093
Power of the Ancient Ones. What does that mean?

637
00:34:06,143 --> 00:34:09,043
I'll tell you to freeze!

638
00:34:09,093 --> 00:34:11,093
Oh! Now I can't...

639
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:13,043
Ina's frozen her arms!

640
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:16,043
What are you doing? Ina's posing her!

641
00:34:16,093 --> 00:34:18,043
Oh, no! Wait! You're like a Hololive Figure!

642
00:34:18,093 --> 00:34:20,093
Why can't I move?

643
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:22,093
No! She's puppeteering her!

644
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:25,043
What's she doing? She's the puppet!

645
00:34:25,093 --> 00:34:28,093
What is she doing to me? Freeze!

646
00:34:28,143 --> 00:34:30,093
No, no, no! This is evil!

647
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:34,043
This is evil! Ballerina! Okay, you're back.

648
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:38,093
Oh my god. I don't know if you guys could see that,

649
00:34:38,093 --> 00:34:42,043
but there were forces moving me.

650
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:44,093
I think it was Ina.

651
00:34:44,093 --> 00:34:48,043
I think it was Ina.

652
00:34:48,093 --> 00:34:50,093
I might be dead here, you know,

653
00:34:50,093 --> 00:34:52,093
but I still have my power.

654
00:34:52,193 --> 00:34:54,593
We're ghosts, so yeah,

655
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,043
we can move stuff.

656
00:34:57,093 --> 00:35:00,093
I guess so. Oh, so does that mean I can move objects as well?

657
00:35:01,405 --> 00:35:02,705
Do you have power to move stuff too, Ame?

658
00:35:03,305 --> 00:35:03,905
Want to try?

659
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:05,205
You try first, it's your idea.

660
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:07,105
Okay. All right.

661
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:10,605
Well, let me get the scythe, the kama...
Well, let me get the scythe, the scythe...

662
00:35:10,805 --> 00:35:11,905
普通のカマ。
A regular scythe.

663
00:35:12,105 --> 00:35:14,105
I'm gonna get the regular scythe.

664
00:35:15,605 --> 00:35:16,605
Here it is.

665
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:18,605
What do you think, Ricky?

666
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:23,605
Uh, no Kiki, just Ricky.

667
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:27,605
Here, would you like to hold it...

668
00:35:27,905 --> 00:35:29,305
...Ina of the Void?

669
00:35:30,105 --> 00:35:32,105
Wait, what did you say? "Would you like to hold it?"

670
00:35:32,305 --> 00:35:34,605
Then we know she's just holding it.

671
00:35:35,505 --> 00:35:37,105
No, no, no, I'm holding it with my powers!

672
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:38,305
Yeah, with her powers.

673
00:35:38,605 --> 00:35:40,105
Mind ghost powers.

674
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,605
That's right. Hah!

675
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:44,605
This is my final power!

676
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:48,605
The scythe, the kama gives you power!
The scythe, the scythe gives you power!

677
00:35:52,605 --> 00:35:54,105
Final attack!

678
00:35:58,305 --> 00:35:59,105
かっこいい！
Cool!

679
00:35:59,605 --> 00:36:00,605
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

680
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:01,905
What are you doing? Stop, stop, stop!

681
00:36:03,105 --> 00:36:04,605
It's just Ricky moving on his own.

682
00:36:05,105 --> 00:36:06,605
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

683
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:10,605
Look at how well... you can really talk with that scythe, huh?

684
00:36:10,905 --> 00:36:12,605
Yeah, I'm used to it.

685
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:15,605
Looking good. Please don't hurt me.

686
00:36:15,905 --> 00:36:17,105
I'll think about it.

687
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:21,105
I guess, wait, hold on.

688
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:22,605
Let's see how low I can go.

689
00:36:24,305 --> 00:36:25,605
Are we doing limbo?

690
00:36:26,105 --> 00:36:27,605
It's limbo time, ladies!

691
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,605
I'm there! I'm there!

692
00:36:32,105 --> 00:36:33,605
Oh, that's a good height!

693
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:36,105
How low can you go? How low can you go?

694
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:44,105
Hold it properly!

695
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:47,105
It takes a lot of power!

696
00:36:49,105 --> 00:36:50,105
All right, we gotta switch.

697
00:36:51,105 --> 00:36:52,605
She's dancing too much.

698
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:03,605
All right, Ina back on the camera.

699
00:37:04,605 --> 00:37:06,605
Watson's got the scythe.

700
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:10,605
Oh god, you have to watch out!

701
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:12,605
Oh, the scythe behind me!

702
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:19,605
You said I was moving too much.

703
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,105
That's pretty cool!

704
00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:25,605
How low can you go? How low can you go?

705
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:33,605
All right, final level.

706
00:37:33,905 --> 00:37:35,605
How low are you gonna make me go?

707
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:37,605
This okay?

708
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:40,605
How low can you go? How low can you go?

709
00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:43,605
Don't hurt yourself!

710
00:37:44,105 --> 00:37:48,105
How low can you go? How low can you go?

711
00:37:49,105 --> 00:37:51,605
I went low! I went low!

712
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,105
You're more flexible than I am.

713
00:37:57,105 --> 00:37:58,605
Everybody's more flexible.

714
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:00,105
Look at that wink! Oh my god!

715
00:38:00,605 --> 00:38:02,105
You were pretty flexible. You had all those dance moves.

716
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:05,605
And you do like this...

717
00:38:07,605 --> 00:38:09,605
That BAN... BANされちゃう。
That BAN... It'll get banned.

718
00:38:10,105 --> 00:38:11,105
I saw something there.

719
00:38:11,305 --> 00:38:11,905
No you didn't.

720
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:13,105
Okay, I did not.

721
00:38:13,305 --> 00:38:14,605
Do we have time for one more request?

722
00:38:15,105 --> 00:38:16,605
Sure! We have more time.

723
00:38:17,305 --> 00:38:20,605
Can you give us some sick kime-pose...
Can you give us some sick finishing pose...

724
00:38:20,905 --> 00:38:24,605
...and then I want the camera to do a 360 as if you're a figurine?

725
00:38:25,105 --> 00:38:26,605
Ooh! That's a good idea!

726
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,605
Okay, let's see.

727
00:38:30,105 --> 00:38:31,605
Maybe with the scythe.

728
00:38:31,905 --> 00:38:33,105
Ah, with the scythe.

729
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:35,605
Cool. Okay, okay. Got this.

730
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,105
All right.

731
00:38:38,605 --> 00:38:41,605
And now 360, slowly and smoothly.

732
00:38:43,105 --> 00:38:44,605
Go, smooth!

733
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:46,605
頑張れ、頑張れ！
Do your best, do your best!

734
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:50,105
It's a figurine on sale right now! Let's go!

735
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:54,105
Limited edition! Pop-up parade figurine!

736
00:38:55,605 --> 00:38:57,605
Oh yeah, that doesn't have the scythe, though.

737
00:38:58,105 --> 00:38:59,605
Yeah!

738
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:02,605
I can do a with-a-scythe version.

739
00:39:03,105 --> 00:39:05,105
Oh yeah, that looks good with the scythe too.

740
00:39:05,605 --> 00:39:07,605
Just like my figures.

741
00:39:12,605 --> 00:39:14,605
I'm really good at standing still.

742
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:21,105
Nice! Oh, look at that figurine!

743
00:39:24,105 --> 00:39:26,605
Ina's camera work! I'm doing that.

744
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:32,605
That was sweet! That was enough!

745
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,105
Ame's skills are super good with the camera.

746
00:39:39,105 --> 00:39:42,605
Anyway, this is a cool pose. This is the last thing you see before you die.

747
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:45,605
Hoi!

748
00:39:46,605 --> 00:39:48,105
Can I get the camera? I want to see something.

749
00:39:48,605 --> 00:39:50,105
You're sitting down now? You were on the camera this whole time.

750
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:58,105
I want to get like a... Whoa!

751
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:01,417
あ、危ない！気をつけて！
Ah, careful! Watch out!

752
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:02,617
あ、あ、あ、stepping...
Ah, ah, ah, stepping...

753
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:03,517
Step!

754
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:04,317
Oh, careful!

755
00:40:04,317 --> 00:40:05,217
Step!

756
00:40:05,217 --> 00:40:06,217
ダメ！
No!

757
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:07,217
Step! ギリギリ！
Step! Just barely!

758
00:40:07,217 --> 00:40:08,617
Please don't step on me!

759
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:10,317
Oh, no! Little Dead Beats, you've been bad.

760
00:40:10,317 --> 00:40:12,717
Bad, bad little Dead Beat. I gotta punish you.

761
00:40:12,717 --> 00:40:14,317
Punishment time!

762
00:40:14,317 --> 00:40:16,917
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!

763
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,517
No! Remember me!

764
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:19,917
Aaaaaah!

765
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,617
I'm banned! That's it Watson, that's it Watson. I'm banned.

766
00:40:22,617 --> 00:40:24,517
No! Ina, Ina was on the camera!

767
00:40:24,517 --> 00:40:26,617
No, stop it! Think of the children!

768
00:40:26,617 --> 00:40:28,517
You can't always do this!

769
00:40:28,517 --> 00:40:30,617
Hold on, I'm banned. It's over.

770
00:40:30,617 --> 00:40:33,317
It's over! Woo! Let's go! 3D debut and I'm banned from YouTube!

771
00:40:33,317 --> 00:40:35,917
Banned, banned! I'm banned all the way!

772
00:40:41,217 --> 00:40:44,317
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway...

773
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:47,517
Anyway, thank you ladies for coming to party with me for a little bit.

774
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:48,917
That was a lot of fun!

775
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:51,417
I love... yay! I love...

776
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,817
Very cute.

777
00:40:55,817 --> 00:40:57,717
Thank you very much. Thank you Guawa as well for joining in.

778
00:40:57,717 --> 00:40:59,317
Yeah!

779
00:40:59,317 --> 00:41:00,717
Thank you so much, guys!

780
00:41:00,717 --> 00:41:02,717
I wish I could control the camera.

781
00:41:02,717 --> 00:41:04,617
It's okay, Gojira. Yeah, we'll have more chances down the line.

782
00:41:04,617 --> 00:41:07,517
Yeah, definitely! Thank you, Ina. Thank you, Ame.

783
00:41:07,517 --> 00:41:10,617
I love you guys! You guys are the best. Thank you Guawa.

784
00:41:10,617 --> 00:41:13,417
I'll see you guys later. Bye!

785
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:15,617
Bye! See you later! Dead party!

786
00:41:15,617 --> 00:41:18,617
Bye friends! See you later friends.

787
00:41:18,617 --> 00:41:21,117
There they go! Off into the distance.

788
00:41:21,117 --> 00:41:23,617
Goodbye friends! And now we are here with only me...

789
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:28,917
If you don't mind, I'm gonna get a little drinky. Where's my drink?

790
00:41:28,917 --> 00:41:32,517
Hold on, I have my water. Mizu. I'll drink Kiara's water bottle because she's not here.

791
00:41:32,517 --> 00:41:35,617
That's okay, she's resting. Anyway...

792
00:41:38,317 --> 00:41:41,317
So, I would say I'm all alone now... Sadness.

793
00:41:41,317 --> 00:41:44,317
But I'm not alone, because I have some friends here with me now.

794
00:41:44,317 --> 00:41:48,617
You guys have seen me do some 3D stuff in the past, right? Not Ohirome, but like concert and stuff.

795
00:41:48,617 --> 00:41:52,617
And at those times I always asked my Holo-senpai to come hang out with me.

796
00:41:52,617 --> 00:41:56,317
But this time, I wanted to do something special. So...

797
00:41:56,317 --> 00:41:59,317
Yo? Question mark? Friend time? More guests?

798
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:02,617
Indeed, more guests are here. Let's see, I see a lot of guesses.

799
00:42:02,617 --> 00:42:05,517
Ayo Adams? There's no Adam. Ayo? Ayo?

800
00:42:05,517 --> 00:42:08,617
A lot of people are saying Kohai. Not Kohai. In fact...

801
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:12,717
代、代、代、代先輩が来てくれた。
A very, very senior colleague has come for me.

802
00:42:12,717 --> 00:42:16,917
So, without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, let's do a song. Here we go!

803
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,617
Oh, it's a fine day to die, Dead Beats!

804
00:42:54,117 --> 00:42:57,117
Graveyard Shift (feat. BGV)

805
00:43:00,117 --> 00:43:02,617
Introducing BGV on the Calliope Mori track, let's go!

806
00:43:02,617 --> 00:43:04,317
Step! Step! Step! Step! Everybody!

807
00:43:08,617 --> 00:43:10,617
Are you guys ready to rock? Yeah!

808
00:43:10,617 --> 00:43:12,617
All right guys, Graveyard Shift. Let's go!

809
00:43:12,617 --> 00:43:15,617
It's always been "life vs me" since the earth stood still,

810
00:43:15,617 --> 00:43:18,617
Cryin' mercy, mercy, as they run for the hills.

811
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:21,117
Gotcha in my sights, and that's all that it takes,

812
00:43:21,117 --> 00:43:23,117
Watch ya bend to the scythe, but call it nature's mistake.

813
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:25,617
Fate's your blind date for today, but lock your doors for tonight,

814
00:43:25,617 --> 00:43:28,317
Pretend that you escaped me 'til I jump you like "sike!"

815
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:31,117
In spite of freaks like you, the mood could use a lift,

816
00:43:31,117 --> 00:43:33,317
Was workin' easily until it jumped to the Graveyard Shift!

817
00:43:33,317 --> 00:43:35,317
HELLO 死神くん 生命なんてチリ紙
Hello Mr. Reaper, life is like tissue paper,

818
00:43:35,317 --> 00:43:37,117
だって CALLI IS CRAZY なら俺はジェリー
Because if Calli is crazy, then I'm Jelly.

819
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:39,117
EVEN MR. SAITAMA NEVER KILL US

820
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,317
その辺の有象無象なら一噛みでイケるかな
Maybe I can take those masses in one bite.

821
00:43:41,317 --> 00:43:43,117
腐ったってタイト どこでもフレッシュでタイト
Rotten but tight, fresh and tight everywhere.

822
00:43:43,117 --> 00:43:45,117
WORKING DEADみたい 詰め寄るぜバイト
Like Working Dead, I'll press you, part-timer.

823
00:43:45,117 --> 00:43:48,317
テーブルで眠るミイラをビルド 締まったタップリいただきにきたってワケさ
Building a mummy sleeping on the table, I've come to take the full tap.

824
00:43:48,317 --> 00:43:51,617
「お迎え」はNO THANK YOU
A visit from death is No Thank You.

825
00:43:54,917 --> 00:44:01,117
浮き足だて LET'S GO CRAZY これば WARNING WARNING WARNING
Get excited, let's go crazy, this is warning, warning, warning.

826
00:44:01,117 --> 00:44:04,617
危ないんじゃない？ 常識を壊す私たち

The vibes at the end of an ego-search won't call for a flyer.

984
00:51:22,641 --> 00:51:24,641
負けずに嗅ぎ取れ Boys & Girls
Don't give in, sniff it out, Boys & Girls.

985
00:51:25,141 --> 00:51:28,641
俺たちのマイク 病気と確信のバックラッシュ
Our microphones. Sickness and the backlash of conviction.

986
00:51:29,141 --> 00:51:31,141
研ぐ度増えるチップの数
The number of chips increases every time we sharpen.

987
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:34,141
好きなときに食うとんかつ お前も立ってりゃいつかさあ
Eating tonkatsu when I want. If you keep standing, someday...

988
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,141
病むよな 病むよな 一人で飲むのアルコール
It's depressing, right? Drinking alcohol alone.

989
00:51:36,341 --> 00:51:39,141
俺のこの声が明日へのバックボーン
My voice is the backbone for tomorrow.

990
00:51:39,241 --> 00:51:41,141
テキーラはワンショットじゃつまんねえ
One shot of tequila isn't enough.

991
00:51:41,341 --> 00:51:44,141
いつものクラブ いつもの席でお前のこと...
In the usual club, at the usual seat, thinking of you...

992
00:51:44,341 --> 00:51:47,141
Never imagined my passion would lead to a success story.

993
00:51:47,141 --> 00:51:49,141
Shout outs to every worldian who's got love for me.

994
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:50,641
Wanna share that fabulous glory.

995
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:52,141
One-man show got nothing for me.

996
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:55,341
Self-serving walk the road alone no high hopes for the staff at your party.

997
00:51:55,441 --> 00:51:57,141
Remember rehab days.

998
00:51:57,341 --> 00:51:58,641
Light in the smoke-filled nights.

999
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:01,141
A pack of big-dreaming strays beneath those factory lights.

1000
00:52:01,241 --> 00:52:03,641
Broken boring kid exploring bridges between worlds.

1001
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:06,141
Found a voice amongst the noise, hey listen, out said girl.

1002
00:52:06,341 --> 00:52:09,141
Looked for the chance in my midst, would not back down or back out.

1003
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:11,941
But I was pessimistic, almost missed it, drowning in doubt.

1004
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:14,341
Will I ever make it big, is it worth it to try?

1005
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:17,641
Like could I really see my picture on that billboard sign?

1006
00:52:17,641 --> 00:52:19,941
Am I out of my mind? Crashing back to days I felt spineless.

1007
00:52:20,141 --> 00:52:23,141
仲間'S 優しさで I was saved by that kindness.
With the kindness of my friends, I was saved by that kindness.

1008
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:25,641
What I find like the pages of the story that binds us.

1009
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:28,141
We progressed, became our best, the footsteps adhering behind us.

1010
00:52:28,141 --> 00:52:30,941
このままで
Just as it is.

1011
00:52:30,941 --> 00:52:33,941
零れてた
Overflowing.

1012
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:38,341
恋心 涙の数きりないけど
My love, and countless tears.

1013
00:52:38,641 --> 00:52:41,641
ただ走った
I just ran.

1014
00:52:41,641 --> 00:52:44,341
ただ辿り着いた
I just arrived.

1015
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:50,641
今懸けるよ 幸せを
Now I'll stake my happiness on it.

1016
00:52:57,141 --> 00:53:00,141
Yeah! Yeah!

1017
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:04,641
CLAP! Come on, CLAP! CLAP!

1018
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:08,641
CLAP! CLAP! Thank you! Yeah!

1019
00:53:09,641 --> 00:53:10,941
Calliope. Yo, what's up Fra?

1020
00:53:11,941 --> 00:53:14,141
Yo, カリ、こんなところまでありがとう。
Yo, Cali, thanks for coming all this way.

1021
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:17,641
ところで俺たちが明日吸う予定のそっちの空気の味は？
By the way, how's the air over there that we're planning to breathe tomorrow?

1022
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:19,941
ほら見て見て先輩、I've come a long way.
Look, look, Senpai, I've come a long way.

1023
00:53:19,941 --> 00:53:23,341
Still making moves from the views we knew from back in the day.

1024
00:53:23,441 --> 00:53:25,941
俺もそうだ、長すぎる一年。お待たせさん。
Me too, it's been a long year. Sorry to keep you waiting.

1025
00:53:25,941 --> 00:53:28,941
止まりそうな夜は背中を見ていたよ、ジョーズ。
On nights that felt like they'd stop, I was looking at your back, Jaws.

1026
00:53:28,941 --> 00:53:31,141
Had my back from the start, so I gotta say ありがとう。
Had my back from the start, so I gotta say thank you.

1027
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,641
Be it this world or the next that we'll meet on every road.

1028
00:53:33,641 --> 00:53:36,641
Still awake in my bed, above CDs I couldn't sell.

1029
00:53:36,641 --> 00:53:39,141
That's what you make, so instead, let it be your reason to rebel.

1030
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:41,641
Far as this Reaper can tell, I was investing in me.

1031
00:53:41,741 --> 00:53:44,341
Penniless, sleeping in hell, that was a test for my being.

1032
00:53:44,441 --> 00:53:47,141
Seeing this dream brought to life before me.

1033
00:53:47,241 --> 00:53:50,141
Every song that restored me, early mornings and chores, things they all led to Your Mori.

1034
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:53,141
Always stay roaring into mics and facing all that comes fast.

1035
00:53:53,241 --> 00:53:56,641
Me still gonna pour my life blood into this so Death can be happy.

1036
00:53:56,741 --> 00:53:59,141
No matter compass for us, one thing that never did change.

1037
00:53:59,141 --> 00:54:02,141
We're still the same wild vagabonds from a far-off age.

1038
00:54:02,241 --> 00:54:04,341
But in the name of refraining from dragging on things fast.

1039
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:07,641
The victory march is on so pass along beyond this Mic-pass!!

1040
00:54:07,941 --> 00:54:10,141
本当のチャンスは俺たちに踏み絵を強要しない。
A true chance doesn't force us into a loyalty test.

1041
00:54:10,241 --> 00:54:13,141
この才能、このダストと言葉にしよう。さあやっておしまい。
Let's put this talent and this dust into words. Now, let's get it done.

1042
00:54:14,141 --> 00:54:16,641
Simon says でも耳を貸すな。Anyway says またライフよりかます MY SELF JUST THE BEAT
Simon says, but don't listen. Anyway says, I'll rock more than life itself, JUST THE BEAT.

1043
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:20,641
橋をかけることこそがドリーム。
Building a bridge is the dream.

1044
00:54:20,741 --> 00:54:23,641
それを渡って向こう岸に行くことがリアル。
Crossing it to the other side is reality.

1045
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:26,641
いつも半歩先に居る 好奇心のゴースト 縦髪握る俺のウィル。
Always half a step ahead. Curiosity's ghost, I'm holding onto its mane, my will.

1046
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:30,141
THIS IS THE MY WILL!

1047
00:54:30,341 --> 00:54:33,341
死んでもいいと思える瞬間を 死んでもなお求めてる。
I'm still seeking that moment where I feel it's okay to die even after death.

1048
00:54:33,441 --> 00:54:36,641
欲深き覚悟 受け取ったマイクで 全てを言葉にしたい。
Greedy resolution. I want to put everything into words with this mic I've received.

1049
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:40,141
神様 俺は世界だけじゃ物足りない。
God, the world alone isn't enough for me.

1050
00:54:40,341 --> 00:54:43,141
さよならも
Farewells too...

1051
00:54:43,141 --> 00:54:45,941
さよならも
Farewells too...

1052
00:54:45,941 --> 00:54:50,641
すり傷にしながら 獣道をゆく
Taking scratches as we walk the path of beasts.

1053
00:54:50,941 --> 00:54:53,941
僕らだって
We too...

1054
00:54:53,941 --> 00:54:56,641
今 手にしたんだ
have now grasped it.

1055
00:54:56,941 --> 00:54:59,941
だから歌うよ この声を
So I'll sing out this voice.

1056
00:55:00,153 --> 00:56:04,953
CROWN (feat. BGV)

1057
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:02,653
あの場所へ...
To that place...

1058
00:55:09,453 --> 00:55:11,953

Holding tight to coins and tears...

1059
00:55:18,353 --> 00:55:20,253
今叫ぶ...
Now I shout...

1060
00:55:20,453 --> 00:55:21,653
Sing it!

幸せだ...
I'm happy...

1062
00:56:05,253 --> 00:56:06,853

1067
00:56:11,253 --> 00:56:12,653
See you around!

1068
00:56:13,653 --> 00:56:15,653
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1069
00:56:16,953 --> 00:56:19,653
Wow. エモい。エモいねなんか。
Wow. Emotional. It's so emotional.

1070
00:56:21,153 --> 00:56:23,653
すごい。Very emotional.
Amazing. Very emotional.

1071
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:28,253
Man, those guys... They've really been there for me

1072
00:56:28,253 --> 00:56:31,153
ever since back in the day when I was nobody.

1073
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:33,353
They always cheered me on.

1074
00:56:33,953 --> 00:56:36,653
So, a big ups to BOOGEY VOXX for being who they are,

1075
00:56:36,653 --> 00:56:39,253
and may their journeys continue,

1076
00:56:39,253 --> 00:56:41,653
and I hope that they still create wonderful things.

1077
00:56:42,153 --> 00:56:45,253
Thank you so much, you guys. That was amazing.
I'm glad that you liked it. Thank you.

1078
00:56:46,953 --> 00:56:49,253
Well, I guess now that we're here...

1079
00:56:49,253 --> 00:56:53,153
...and it's just me alone again on this big stage.

1080
00:56:53,653 --> 00:56:55,653
But I'm not alone because I have wonderful Dead Beats.

1081
00:56:55,753 --> 00:56:58,353
Dead Beats everywhere. I'm not alone.

1082
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:01,453
I'm not alone because you guys are here.

1083
00:57:01,453 --> 00:57:03,253
That's always how it's been.

1084
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,453
Thank you so kindly. Really, truly.

1085
00:57:06,453 --> 00:57:08,653
Now speaking of live shows...

1086
00:57:08,653 --> 00:57:11,253
I recently made a big announcement about the

1087
00:57:11,253 --> 00:57:15,253
Mori Calliope New Underworld Order Blu-ray!

1088
00:57:15,653 --> 00:57:17,953
Blu-ray! Blu-ray, Blu-ray, Blu-ray, Blu-ray!

1089
00:57:17,953 --> 00:57:20,353
If you didn't get a chance to get it, check it out!

1090
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,653
This is how you can find it. You go to my channel.

1091
00:57:22,653 --> 00:57:24,253
Hey look, that's me!

1092
00:57:24,253 --> 00:57:26,653
You can also check it out in the description of this video.

1093
00:57:26,653 --> 00:57:28,653
You can find a link to the Blu-ray.

1094
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,653
But there's the trailer, click that.

1095
00:57:30,653 --> 00:57:33,653
Go down... Yes, baby! Thank you for making this video, J-Chad.

1096
00:57:33,653 --> 00:57:36,253
Go down to the description, click that little blue link right there,

1097
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:38,353
and you can choose what store you get it from.

1098
00:57:38,353 --> 00:57:40,653
Either of those links, okay?

1099
00:57:40,653 --> 00:57:43,153
And the shipping may be cheaper if you choose a local place.

1100
00:57:43,153 --> 00:57:46,653
But if you're in the States, you definitely want to use
the Calliope Mori official shop

1101
00:57:46,653 --> 00:57:49,153
because the shipping is going to be way, way cheaper there.

1102
00:57:49,353 --> 00:57:51,253
Take a look, there's the Blu-ray!

1103
00:57:51,253 --> 00:57:53,253
And with the Limited Edition...

1104
00:57:53,253 --> 00:57:55,953
...you get a special tapestry. 特別なタペストリーもありますよ。
...you get a special tapestry. There's a special tapestry too.

1105
00:57:56,353 --> 00:57:58,353
Check it out! ボリュームいっぱい！
Check it out! It's full of content!

1106
00:57:58,353 --> 00:58:00,953
There's so many songs. So many songs.

1107
00:58:01,453 --> 00:58:03,653
So, um... it's really a fantastic piece.

1108
00:58:03,653 --> 00:58:06,153
I would love it if you would check it out,

1109
00:58:06,153 --> 00:58:08,653
especially if you didn't get to see the show.

1110
00:58:09,253 --> 00:58:11,353
And then on the Twitter, you can check it out on...

1111
00:58:11,353 --> 00:58:12,953
...the Twitter. On my Twitter.

1112
00:58:13,253 --> 00:58:16,253
If you scroll down, you can find the tweet there, click that link.

1113
00:58:17,353 --> 00:58:20,353
As a matter of fact, go ahead and check out and follow

1114
00:58:20,353 --> 00:58:23,253
the official Mori Calliope Artist Twitter.

1115
00:58:23,653 --> 00:58:26,653
That pretty much gets notified about everything right away.

1116
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:29,353
If you want the earliest news about me and what I'm doing,

1117
00:58:29,353 --> 00:58:31,353
go follow the official Artist Twitter.

1118
00:58:31,653 --> 00:58:33,353
And that's all I have to say about the Blu-ray.

1119
00:58:33,353 --> 00:58:36,253
Please get the Blu-ray and enjoy. Enjoy!

1120
00:58:36,253 --> 00:58:39,253
Show it to your friends and family—just kidding, don't do that.

1121
00:58:39,253 --> 00:58:41,653
Um, please enjoy the Blu-ray and enjoy watching

1122
00:58:41,653 --> 00:58:43,653
all your favorite Mori performances, because it's really amazing.

1123
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:47,953
And I think the audio has been kind of like specially,

1124
00:58:47,953 --> 00:58:50,253
you know, arranged and put together.

1125
00:58:50,253 --> 00:58:53,253
I watched the whole thing, and it's good. It's good.

1126
00:58:53,253 --> 00:58:56,253
It's good sound quality, is what I'm trying to say.

1127
00:58:57,253 --> 00:58:59,253
Now, we also have another thing.

1128
00:58:59,253 --> 00:59:01,253
As you may all have guessed...

1129
00:59:01,353 --> 00:59:03,653
...I too have 3D merchandise!

1130
00:59:04,253 --> 00:59:05,253
It is... Tada!

1131
00:59:05,653 --> 00:59:10,653
Mori Calliope Pendant & Accessory Stand Set

1132
00:59:07,653 --> 00:59:10,653
A very special pendant accessory set.

1133
00:59:10,653 --> 00:59:14,253
Now before you say, "Wait a minute, that's just for the ladies, Calliope Mori!

1134
00:59:14,253 --> 00:59:17,253
What the heck? I can't get that!"

1135
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:21,253
Wrong! Wrong you are. Anyone can wear this ice, okay?

1136
00:59:21,253 --> 00:59:24,253
Anyone. It'll look cool on anybody.

1137
00:59:24,253 --> 00:59:26,653
And you know what? If you really don't want to wear it
as a necklace, you've got two other options.

1138
00:59:27,653 --> 00:59:30,253
You can kind of, you know, make a keychain yourself.

1139
00:59:30,253 --> 00:59:33,353
You're going to have to use some tweezers, but you can make a keychain out of it,

1140
00:59:33,353 --> 00:59:35,253
which is pretty cool.

1141
00:59:35,253 --> 00:59:37,653
Or you can set it up just like this as a collector's piece

1142
00:59:37,653 --> 00:59:41,253
with the special scythe acrylic.

1143
00:59:41,253 --> 00:59:44,253
And it just hangs down right from there. It's got my signature on it.

1144
00:59:44,353 --> 00:59:47,253
So you can, you know, put it somewhere special.

1145
00:59:47,253 --> 00:59:49,353
Show your friends, "Hey, look, that's the special Mori Calliope pendant."

1146
00:59:49,653 --> 00:59:52,253
I really wanted some cool jewelry for me.

1147
00:59:52,653 --> 00:59:55,253
So, anyway, that's my 3D merchandise.

1148
00:59:55,253 --> 00:59:57,253
A cute pendant. Everybody else's is kind of...

1149
01:00:00,165 --> 01:00:01,031
so far, right?

1150
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:01,998
Um, with...

1151
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:04,431
with Ina and Gura, they had kind of like life essential things.

1152
01:00:04,431 --> 01:00:06,731
I wanted to do something that is kind of like

1153
01:00:06,731 --> 01:00:08,031
out of the way of that, I guess.

1154
01:00:08,031 --> 01:00:09,331
So here's this pendant.

1155
01:00:09,331 --> 01:00:10,698
やった！ (Yatta!)
Yay!

1156
01:00:10,698 --> 01:00:11,931
So yeah, anyway.

1157
01:00:11,931 --> 01:00:13,731
You can purchase this after

1158
01:00:13,731 --> 01:00:15,431
the big Myth collab on the 5th.

1159
01:00:16,965 --> 01:00:18,898
Everybody's 3D merch will be available,

1160
01:00:18,898 --> 01:00:20,265
so please wait until then.

1161
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:22,731
Um...

1162
01:00:22,731 --> 01:00:23,865
I guess that's it.

1163
01:00:24,198 --> 01:00:24,865
Wow.

1164
01:00:24,865 --> 01:00:26,665
We did it. We did a show.

1165
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,631
Here, in this big stage,

1166
01:00:28,631 --> 01:00:30,331
with all of you together with me.

1167
01:00:30,731 --> 01:00:32,398
Um, thank you.

1168
01:00:33,331 --> 01:00:35,565
Well, before this place burns to the ground,

1169
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:37,565
I just want to say thank you so much everyone.

1170
01:00:38,398 --> 01:00:40,198
For always supporting me

1171
01:00:40,198 --> 01:00:41,698
and for looking out for me.

1172
01:00:41,998 --> 01:00:43,331
I'll keep doing my best.

1173
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:45,731
And I guess I'll catch you on the flip side.

1174
01:00:46,565 --> 01:00:48,731
I guess I gotta go back to the overworld

1175
01:00:48,731 --> 01:00:49,865
cause there's still stuff to do.

1176
01:00:49,865 --> 01:00:51,265
There's lots more to do!

1177
01:00:51,598 --> 01:00:53,198
Alright! Well, I gotta go.

1178
01:00:54,498 --> 01:00:55,865
Uh, goodbye everyone.

1179
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:58,431
PEACE!
