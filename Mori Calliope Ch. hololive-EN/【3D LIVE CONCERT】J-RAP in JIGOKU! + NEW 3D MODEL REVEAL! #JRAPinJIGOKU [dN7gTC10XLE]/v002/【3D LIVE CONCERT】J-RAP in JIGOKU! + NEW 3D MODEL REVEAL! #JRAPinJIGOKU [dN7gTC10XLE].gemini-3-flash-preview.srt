00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,800
It was music that brought me to this country.

3
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,200
In the undulating whirlwind of life,

4
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,200
it's only normal to seek some place you belong.

5
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,800
...and that place you belong is often underscored by...

6
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,000
...a thing that you like.

7
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,800
A thing that draws you in and gives you an identity.

8
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,200
But I had obligations. Ya know, stuff to do.

9
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,500
Stuff I HAD to do.

10
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,500
It's funny how liking one thing can lead to loving another thing.

11
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,000
That was the case with me, actually.

12
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Walking around, confused, bored...

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,500
Lost, I guess.

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,500
And then, just like that- there's a moment where...

15
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,000
...it clicks.

16
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,200
It clicks, and suddenly, you're different.

17
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,000
Different in some way you can't explain.

18
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Huh?

19
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,500
Oh! Where are you...?

20
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,000
A rabbit hole appears before you.

21
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,000
And you see how far it takes you.

皆さん、Welcome one and all to my very special Halloween night concert, J-RAP in JIGOKU!
Everyone, welcome one and all to my very special Halloween night concert, J-RAP in JIGOKU!

115
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:27,508
I hope you guys are already having a great time!

116
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:32,408
The first song that I kicked off this concert with is "Yofukashi no Uta"...

117
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:36,208
...or in English, "A Staying Up Late Lullaby" or something like that.

118
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:41,008
It's my favorite Creepy Nuts song ever and I actually got to perform it with Creepy Nuts a while back...

119
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:44,208
...but that was a paid thing, a paid programming.

120
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:48,008
So this time, I got to perform it for you guys on this amazing stage!

121
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:51,208
Isn't it so awesome?

122
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:55,408
I feel like it really, like, it encapsulates the idea of J-RAP, which is my roots, by the way.

123
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,508
The theme of this concert is "Roots".

124
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:03,508
Like where do you come from, and you should never forget your roots. Well, my roots are in J-RAP.

125
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:07,408
Japanese rap, they always have been for many years ever since I came here to Japan...

126
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:10,508
...to be involved in the scene. Isn't it an amazing stage?

127
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:14,008
Look at it, we got graffiti everywhere! Oh my gosh, it's like...

128
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:17,408
...I mean it's graffiti, but it's very like Wafu.
...I mean it's graffiti, but it's very like Japanese-style.

129
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:21,408
なんか、日本のテイストも入ってるから本当に最高。
It's got some Japanese taste in it too, so it's really the best.

130
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:25,408
めっちゃめちゃいい感じ。かっこいいっすね、このステージ。
It feels great. This stage is so cool.

131
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:29,408
この素敵な舞台の上に色んな...
On this wonderful stage, various...

132
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,408
...J-RAP曲やってみたいと思います。
...J-RAP songs I'd like to perform.

133
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:37,408
And there's so many different kinds of J-RAP and different communities within the genre of J-RAP.

134
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:42,408
And so I tried to pick a lot of songs for the setlist that I guess are like very different from each other...

135
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:46,008
...but still Japanese rap. And, um...

136
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:50,008
...I think that you guys might also realize there's a bit of a story going on in between some of the songs...

137
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:54,008
...so I hope you guys will pay attention to that because that's also about my roots.

138
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:57,408
Moving on to the hashtag, the hashtag is #JRAPinJIGOKU.

139
00:08:57,408 --> 00:09:02,008
Like I said, #JRAPinJIGOKU. I hope you guys will take lots of screenshots.

140
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:06,408
スクリーンショットいっぱい撮ってほしい！お願いします！
I want you to take lots of screenshots! Please!

141
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:10,008
はい！There's going to be a lot of really cool effects on the stage...
Yes! There's going to be a lot of really cool effects on the stage...

142
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,408
...like there's an audio spectrum on the ground that like...

143
00:09:13,408 --> 00:09:17,008
...it like reacts to my vocals when I'm singing and stuff like that.

144
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:20,408
It's just... it's really cool. This is a dream live for me, so I hope you guys will enjoy!

145
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:24,408
We also have a lot of really amazing guests, some that are going to blow your mind.

146
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:28,408
すごい、とても素敵なゲストも来るから皆さん...
Some really great guests are coming, so everyone...

Yeah! It was so cool!

314
00:18:58,524 --> 00:19:02,524
So fun. I'll never forget it. I have so many unforgettable experiences with you guys.

315
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:05,524
Like when we went to the onsen!

316
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:08,524
ONSEN! ONSEN! That was so much fun!

317
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:12,524
We-we had a bit of mishaps. Yeah, there was a mishap.

318
00:19:12,524 --> 00:19:16,524
There was a misunderstanding. Mishap! Misunderstanding!

319
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:19,524
Yeah, everybody went into the kake-mizu...

320
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:22,524
...because I thought it was the koto-yu!

321
00:19:22,524 --> 00:19:25,024
It's me! Calli! There was no sign that said don't come in here.

322
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:27,524
No, no sign! It didn't say no nothing!

323
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:30,024
Kake-mizu, you can pour the water...

324
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:33,524
...so you just thought it was like a small bath! Yeah!

325
00:19:33,524 --> 00:19:35,524
But when it's for baths, but...

326
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:37,524
もう入らないね。
We won't go in anymore.

327
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:39,524

We did go in though.

328
00:19:39,524 --> 00:19:41,524

It was a disaster.

ごめんなさい。
Sorry.

330
00:19:43,024 --> 00:19:46,024
BAU BAU! We didn't know! It was a misunderstanding.

331
00:19:46,024 --> 00:19:49,024
But it's okay! It's a good memory!

332
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:52,524
I feel like we need to hit the onsen after this.

333
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,524
Let's go right after!

334
00:19:54,524 --> 00:19:56,524
Right after, right after the show.

335
00:19:56,524 --> 00:20:00,024
But for now, I'm doing this big show centered around J-RAP.

336
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,132
Please!

337
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:02,832
I want to know, what are you guys' roots?

338
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:03,332
Roots?

339
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:04,632
Of course! BAU BAU!

340
00:20:04,832 --> 00:20:08,432
We really, really like idols and anime songs.

Yeah.

342
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:10,532
So I think that's our roots.

343
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:12,332
You guys' roots. Such nice roots.

344
00:20:13,632 --> 00:20:17,432
Yeah, but you know, J-Rock also fits in that rap, too!

345
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:18,532
Yes, yes!

346
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:21,032

Let's hang out again soon and dance together, okay?

354
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,532
Definitely, definitely! Okay!

355
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:36,132

Well, I'm feeling very energized.

365
00:20:58,332 --> 00:21:03,032
Those two are the best. And honestly, I feel ready to talk about the next part of my roots.

366
00:21:04,632 --> 00:21:08,532
I hope you guys will enjoy the story as it's unfolding.

367
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:10,432
Kind of like my life, I don't know.

368
00:21:10,532 --> 00:21:12,332
Um, are you guys ready for the next part?

369
00:21:12,432 --> 00:21:14,232
Let's keep enjoying the show together.

Please enjoy.

372
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:27,732
The days I can't get back...

373
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:32,432
Days we spent singing and laughing and not caring.

374
00:21:33,932 --> 00:21:36,532
There was peace in that hectic time.

375
00:21:37,432 --> 00:21:40,432
"Maybe someday I can go on a musical adventure with my friends, too!"

376
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:43,332
"Just like those performers I admire so much."

377
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:44,732
But...

378
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:46,432
I was already on one.

379
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:48,332
I just didn't see it.

380
00:21:51,532 --> 00:21:56,232
Night after night, in a strange country full of words I didn't understand,

381
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:59,332
unfamiliar things were everywhere and yet...

382
00:22:00,632 --> 00:22:02,332
They became irreplaceable.

383
00:22:05,932 --> 00:22:08,532
So then... how were any of us to know?

384
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:11,832
It wasn't meant to last.

385
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:45,332
Hey there.

386
00:22:57,132 --> 00:22:59,632
Don't suppose that's where all the trouble began...?

387

Listen, Bae, the theme of this whole deal is roots. So like, what are your roots like?

627
00:35:57,356 --> 00:36:02,556

Whoa, look at those fancy moves! Fancy move! What the heck?

630
00:36:15,556 --> 00:36:22,556

They shut it all down.

648
00:37:33,556 --> 00:37:37,856
The miasma that permeated this town did its job,

649
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,856
and the people I ran through those nights with...

650
00:37:41,056 --> 00:37:44,056
Just kind of... disappeared.

651
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:46,056
Back to real life.

652
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,056
They left the dream.

653
00:37:51,056 --> 00:37:53,056
“How am I supposed to go back?”

654
00:37:53,556 --> 00:37:57,056
“This music is the only reason I’m here.”

655
00:37:57,556 --> 00:38:01,056
“There’s nothing left back there for me.”

656
00:38:03,556 --> 00:38:07,056
“In a land where I lost my identity.”

657
00:38:10,056 --> 00:38:14,556
“If there’s no more music here, then I have no choice but to go home.”

658
00:38:16,556 --> 00:38:19,856
It was music that brought me to this country.

659
00:38:20,056 --> 00:38:23,056
It was music that kept me here.

660
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:30,856
But...

661
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:33,856
It was a hand that reached out at that moment

662
00:38:34,056 --> 00:38:37,056
that I thought I’d never hear an inspiring melody again.

663
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:40,056
Maybe it was never the “end of a life.”

664
00:38:40,556 --> 00:38:43,056
It was the continuation of a story...

665
00:38:43,556 --> 00:38:45,056
My story.

666
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:49,056

00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,080
Don't believe this crap and waste some time while I possess coping systems.

906
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,580
Doing it better than just settling for another regular.

907
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:08,580
Letters to my enemies, yeah, I'm telling them breaking it down to the level molecular.

908
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,580
Alright, better be wise when you're choosing battles, mostly babbles.

909
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,580
You know what are those bits are shady, faux-poses of a binary foe.

910
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:17,080
Drop these bars in my sleep, few more tricks up my sleeve.

911
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,580
Way too late to choose, believe now!

912
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,580
Disturbing the peace!

913
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:24,580
Look into my eyes!

914
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:29,580
Now tell me the things you blabbering about behind my back.

915
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,580
The tenacity!

916
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:36,580
I hold it tight to break it down.

917
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:42,580
It's too late for apologies, it's going down now!

918
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,580
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

919
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,080
Take it away!

920
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,080
You're thirsty for blood as you're craving for love.

921
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,080
What you only want is the greed makes you go numb.

922
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,580
Purposes full of bucket of salt, hey please stop, the talk's about to be of patience.

923
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,580
Because I'm about to knock you out cold.

924
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:05,880
Bring it back, please.

925
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,580
Whole lot of moves to make you on your life dance.

926
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:11,580
Blowing doing this beat down, you probably wish that you could fast forward.

927
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,580
Don't you worry about it, leave some room for your last words.

928
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,580
Have to do this, do that, and the third.

929
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,580
Disturbing the peace!

930
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,080
Look into my eyes!

931
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,580
Now tell me the things you blabbering about behind my back.

932
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,580
The tenacity!

933
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:34,580
I hold it tight to break it down.

934
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:39,580
It's too late for apologies, it's going down!

935
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,580
And some things may break me.

936
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,580
But I'll always get back up.

937
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,580
New perspective gained from all the pain and stress.

938
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:54,080
And when I do come back.

939
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,580
I'm stronger than ever before so...

940
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:03,080
Kneel down! Disturbing the peace!

941
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,580
Look into my eyes!

942
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:11,080
Now tell me the things you blabbering about behind my back.

943
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,080
The tenacity!

944
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,080
I hold it tight to break it down.

945
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:25,580
It's too late for apologies, it's going down!

946
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:37,080
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

947
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,580
It's going down now.

948
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,580
That's right, baby.

949
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,923
Thank you so much everyone for listening!

950
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,288

That was fun, that was fun.

957

Oh my gosh! It was seriously a dream of mine though, just because...

958
00:55:21,588 --> 00:55:22,588
Really?

959
00:55:22,588 --> 00:55:27,588
...you know, I mean, I've been a fan of your music like ever since high school, you know?

960
00:55:27,888 --> 00:55:30,288
That's just crazy. I feel old, by the way.

961
00:55:30,288 --> 00:55:34,588
Oh no, not at all! You do not look it at all. You are so awesome. Oh my gosh.

962
00:55:34,588 --> 00:55:36,288

And like your rap in that game was my first exposure ever to like...

967
00:55:49,088 --> 00:55:54,588
...I guess what I would call like J-Rap even though it's in English.

968
00:55:54,588 --> 00:55:55,588
Okay.

969
00:55:56,088 --> 00:56:00,088
So like that was the first time that I heard like a Japanese rapper and thought to myself...

970
00:56:00,088 --> 00:56:03,088
"Oh my God, that's amazing! J-Rap's so cool," you know?

971
00:56:03,088 --> 00:56:06,588
Wow, wow. Appreciate that. I mean, I did it like 18 years ago and...

972
00:56:06,588 --> 00:56:07,888
18 years ago!

973
00:56:08,288 --> 00:56:13,588
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was a young rapper in Japan trying to make it out there, having fun and...

974
00:56:13,588 --> 00:56:18,588
...it's just crazy that you know, people like you listen to it and now you're the artist and...

975
00:56:18,588 --> 00:56:22,588
...so it's an honor to inspire people like you.

976
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:27,088
Thank you so much! No, I mean, also J-Rap is like kind of my roots now as well...

977
00:56:27,088 --> 00:56:30,088
...which is why we have this show that's happening right now, you know?

978
00:56:30,288 --> 00:56:31,088
Okay.

979
00:56:31,088 --> 00:56:33,288

00:56:37,088 --> 00:56:39,588
It's like a transcendental experience.

982
00:56:39,588 --> 00:56:41,088
I love it, man. I love it.

983
00:56:41,288 --> 00:56:46,888
Thank you so much for being here. And also thank you for singing with me on "Sneaking Revenge" as well for my album.

984
00:56:47,588 --> 00:56:52,588
Oh no doubt about that. That was a lot of fun. I mean, it was my first time not writing the lyrics...

985
00:56:52,588 --> 00:56:57,088
...so it's like a cover song, but I met you the first time in the studio and we did it.

986
00:56:57,088 --> 00:57:04,088
Unfortunately had to leave early, but you know, we got to... I got to listen to your recording and you got to listen to mine and it was a lot of fun.

987
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:04,588
Yeah.

988
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:08,888
Yeah, just getting to be in the studio together was seriously a dream come true for me. So thank you so much.

989
00:57:10,088 --> 00:57:14,588
And I always thought to myself that I wanted to have like a male vocalist on the track as well...

990
00:57:14,588 --> 00:57:17,588
...and you just fit perfectly because, I don't know, you've got like the coolest voice ever so...

991
00:57:17,888 --> 00:57:18,588
Okay.

996
00:57:31,088 --> 00:57:33,088

S-O-S, check the test, if you're just standing around dazed, it's an immediate Zen

1058
01:01:36,096 --> 01:01:41,596
ナイスアタック、ナイスディフェンス、必要なのはサバイバルのセンス
Nice attack, nice defense, what's needed is a survival sense

1059

Go, go, Here we go, here we go, High-mers, tomorrow you'll be the hero

1064
01:02:59,096 --> 01:03:03,596
Yo, Dead Beats, did you enjoy the show? I've got a couple more announcements for you

1065
01:03:03,596 --> 01:03:07,596
before we head off to the MV premiere and then the members-only encore performance

1066
01:03:07,596 --> 01:03:09,596
at 9:15 JST. So don't head out yet, okay?

1067
01:03:09,596 --> 01:03:11,596
はい、お知らせあります！
Yes, I have announcements!

1068
01:03:11,596 --> 01:03:14,596
You know what time it is? Goods time! These are technically to celebrate

1069
01:03:14,596 --> 01:03:17,596
my fourth anniversary, but they're themed around today's show.

1070
01:03:17,596 --> 01:03:19,596
そうです、グッズあります！
That's right, there's merch!

1071
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:23,096
First off, we've got a poster from the underground. It's a huge poster of me, Mori Calliope,

1072
01:03:23,096 --> 01:03:27,096
in Underworld-ian street fashion promoting my J-Rap themed live show.

1073
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:30,096
A nice memory of our night together in Neo-Tokyo.

1074
01:03:30,096 --> 01:03:32,596
とっても素敵なポスターです！
It's a very wonderful poster!

1075
01:03:32,596 --> 01:03:36,096
Want to write lyrics? Scribble doodles? Write letters to fictional characters

1076
01:03:36,096 --> 01:03:39,596
about everyone who bullied you in school? About existential thoughts that plague you daily?

1077
01:03:39,596 --> 01:03:44,096
Grab a Mori-themed notebook! It's a super cute design with lots of mini Moraries running around it,

1078
01:03:44,096 --> 01:03:46,596
so make it yours today. とっても素敵なノートです！
so make it yours today. It's a very wonderful notebook!

1079
01:03:46,596 --> 01:03:50,096
Are you ready to shed your mortal coil and become an actual skeleton?

1080
01:03:50,096 --> 01:03:54,096
Well, if you did that, Mori would get in huge trouble, so for now, how about a Dead Beat themed hoodie?

1081
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:58,596
You could also use it as a Halloween costume as a regular old skeleton, but cooler. It's super comfy,

1082
01:03:58,596 --> 01:04:01,096
so make sure you grab it. とっても素敵なフーディです！
so make sure you grab it. It's a very wonderful hoodie!

1083
01:04:01,096 --> 01:04:04,596
Finally, we have... Oh God. Oh God. No, wait, no, not that thing.

1084
01:04:04,596 --> 01:04:09,596
Wait, Mane-chan... Mane-chan, wasn't there something else we were selling? Like a water bottle or something?

1085
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:14,096
Why is this weird freaking cat here? Okay, I'm being told to roll with it.

1086
01:04:14,096 --> 01:04:18,596
Uh, Weird Cat is here as a cute plushie for your Mori plushie collection.

1087
01:04:18,596 --> 01:04:23,096
Just look, if you buy this thing, be careful, okay? I don't claim any responsibility

1088
01:04:23,096 --> 01:04:31,096
for whatever happens to you after. とっても怖いぬいぐるみです！
for whatever happens to you after. It's a very scary plushie!

1089
01:04:33,596 --> 01:04:38,596
If you buy all these pieces of merch, you'll get this: a sticker sheet full of mini Moraries.

1090
01:04:38,596 --> 01:04:43,596
Stick them onto your car, your computer, your little brother's Switch and see how angry he gets.

1091
01:04:43,596 --> 01:04:47,596
I don't know, they're your stickers now, so do whatever you want with them, I guess. 全部のグッズ買ったら、素敵なステッカーもらえます！
I don't know, they're your stickers now, so do whatever you want with them, I guess. If you buy all the goods, you'll get a wonderful sticker!

1092
01:04:47,596 --> 01:04:52,596
Now that merch is out of the way, let's talk about my brand new song releasing.

1093
01:04:52,596 --> 01:04:57,096
That's right folks, a brand new J-Rap single titled 'FLASH BANG' is coming out right after this stream.

1094
01:04:57,096 --> 01:05:00,096
I got to make a song with the J-Rap legend PES-sama, one of the most iconic rappers...

1095
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:04,004
in Japan, a member of RIP SLYME who helped popularize the entire J-Rap genre.

1096
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:07,514
RIP SLYMEのPESさんと一緒にコラボしました！
I've collaborated with PES from RIP SLYME!

1097
01:05:07,514 --> 01:05:09,384
やったー！パチパチパチパチ！

1098

1099
01:05:11,554 --> 01:05:15,034
We got a special message from him too, so let's run the clip!

1100
01:05:16,584 --> 01:05:19,004
はい。えー、Dead Beatsの皆さん、こんにちは。

1102
01:05:20,624 --> 01:05:26,254
えー、Calliopeさんの『Super Shooter』、いかがでしたでございましたでしょうか？
What did you think of Calliope's "Super Shooter"?

1103
01:05:26,254 --> 01:05:32,584
えー、この度、私PESがですね、Calliopeさんとコラボさせていただくことになりました。

So about this song, I think everyone is really enjoying watching Calliope's Live

1109
01:05:50,914 --> 01:05:59,334
そのライブね、こう終わった後だって、いろんな普段の生活の中でもこうパッと、こう連れ戻されるような、
and that Live, once it is over, during your normal everyday life, there are instances

1110
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:04,634
パッと思い出してしまうような、そんな瞬間が彼女のこう魅力の中にあるんじゃないかなっていうことでですね、
where you are just suddenly brought back and just suddenly remember.

1111
01:06:04,634 --> 01:06:11,334
パッと、一瞬フッと、その瞬間に戻ってしまえるような、そんな楽しい曲になっておるかと、
Her ability to make people feel that is one of her strong points I feel. Suddenly, in one moment,

1112
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:17,484
思われますので、ぜひ皆さん聴いてみてください。ありがとうございます。
in that instance you remember the song. That fun type of song

1113
01:06:17,484 --> 01:06:21,384
思われますので、ぜひ皆さん聴いてみてください。ありがとうございます。
is what I think we were able to make,

1114
01:06:21,384 --> 01:06:23,824
ぜひ皆さん聴いてみてください。ありがとうございます。
so everyone be sure to listen to it!

1115

ありがとうございます。
Thank you!

1116
01:06:28,504 --> 01:06:32,054
Thank you so much, PES-san! Another one of my big dreams has come true.

1117
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:35,884
I hope you guys loop the song lots and enjoy the super cute animated music video.

1118
01:06:35,884 --> 01:06:41,464
It really encapsulates my love for Japanese rap, and I hope those feelings come through to all of you when you listen.

1119
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:44,304
Thanks again for tuning in, everyone! Keep enjoying J-Rap.

1120
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:47,464
Keep enjoying Mori. Keep enjoying things that make you happy.

1121
01:06:47,464 --> 01:06:52,424
Catch you on the flip side, and hopefully at the premiere and member's encore. Peace!
