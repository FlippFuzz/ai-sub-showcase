157
00:11:49,016 --> 00:11:50,516
I did my best. We're back! We're back!

158
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:53,016
But I can't... I can't do the splits.

159
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:56,516
But now, we're matching!

160
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,016
Twinning!

161
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:02,016
Triplet-ing!

162
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:04,016
That's a nice ring to it.

163
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:11,016
Um, this next song is one that FUWAMOCO we wanted to sing with you for such a long time!

164
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:16,016
Something nostalgic, and I think you'll be able to see why. There's some rap in there as well!

165
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:18,016
Oh yeah! Yeah! But it's also very cute, right?

166
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:26,516
次に歌う曲は、カリ先パイと一緒にずっと歌いたかった大好きな曲です！
The next song is a favorite song that I've wanted to sing with Calli-senpai for a long time!

167
00:12:26,516 --> 00:12:27,516
そうね！
Right!

168
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:30,016
It's both cute, it's cool.

169
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:35,016
But I think you know, it shares an important part that, you know, you should be proud of what you like, right?

170
00:12:35,016 --> 00:12:37,016
Important meaning of being proud...

171
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:41,516
...being strong about what you like, yeah! Your likes!

172
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:46,016
No matter what they be... Games! Anime! Idol!

173
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:51,016
Figures! Or maybe even... VTubers!

174
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:53,016
Oh! Nice! You were in sync there. Abau!

175
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:58,516
After all, life is more fun when you're just true to yourself, right?

176
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:01,016
Um, we're going to sing this song for you guys!

177
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:03,516
Okay, let's do the title call together, okay?

178
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:05,516

Please listen!

do you like it? I like it!

193
00:13:57,516 --> 00:14:00,516
実生活 送るのも楽じゃないわ
Living real life isn't easy either

194
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:04,016
好きなもの 好きって言えたらそれスーパーノヴァ
If I can say I like what I like, that's a Supernova

195
00:14:04,516 --> 00:14:07,516
快感中枢 即マックスのバース
Pleasure center, immediate max verse

196
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:11,016
待ちに待った かけがえのない時間と歌うバンバンバン
Singing 'bang bang bang' with the long-awaited, irreplaceable time

197
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:15,016
プラス マジック 踊り出せば 夢中 駆け抜けろ 一生ショー
Plus magic, if you start dancing, run through absorbed in a lifetime show

198
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:18,516
悩みさえ 煌めくのさ 今すぐ Let's make some noise
Even worries will sparkle, right now Let's make some noise

199
00:14:18,516 --> 00:14:21,516
君が部屋にいたって メン限すればコンサート
Even if you're in your room, if you do a members-only stream, it's a concert

200
00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:25,516
いつだって Lonely only Lonely only just don't know but say it's you!
Every day is Lonely only Lonely only just don't know but say it's you!

201
00:14:26,016 --> 00:14:28,016

202
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:32,516
きっと 全てが カラフルで
Surely everything will be colorful

203
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:35,016

Finally, from today, nice to meet you

207
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:50,016
ほら キラキラ 夢みたい
Look, sparkling like a dream

208
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:54,016

いいね、好きでしょうがない
Nice, I just can't help liking it

213
00:15:04,824 --> 00:15:07,824
次は、何にしようかな
I wonder what I should do next

214
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:10,574
I'll be back, world at night, took 'em all away, yo

215
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:12,474
飛ばさい、言葉払い、Cry Cry、okay?
Blowing away the bad words, Cry Cry, okay?

216
00:15:12,574 --> 00:15:15,474
360度パノラマ、全方向大好きのシーン
360-degree panorama, a scene of loving every direction

217
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:18,474
何が一つでもいいから、のめり込める自分のアイテム
Just one thing is fine, my own item I can immerse myself in

218
00:15:18,574 --> 00:15:22,274
Like a superstar fire man、無敵キャンディ、他は大体来世
Like a superstar fire man, Invincibility Candy, the rest in the next life

219
00:15:22,574 --> 00:15:26,174
望んでる彼もきっと現世が愛おしくなるはずなのさ
The guy he's wishing for will surely find this life lovable too

220
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:29,474
なろうとしてなるもんじゃない、人生楽しんで歩こうじゃない
It's not something you try to become, let's just enjoy walking through life

221
00:15:29,974 --> 00:15:32,974
自分に素直であれ、Spotlight、僕らを照らせ
Be true to yourself, Spotlight, shine on us

222
00:15:33,174 --> 00:15:35,474
今日も愛を叫ぶだけだ、Get down!
Today again, I'm just shouting out love, Get down!

223
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:36,824
This is a song for you!

224
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:40,024
I Like It! I Like It! 手を伸ばせば
I Like It! I Like It! If I reach out my hand

225
00:15:40,224 --> 00:15:43,824
きっと全てがミラクルで
I'm sure everything will be a miracle

226
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:47,024
Happy! Happy! 日常でさえ
Happy! Happy! Even everyday life

227
00:15:47,224 --> 00:15:50,524
夢の物語さ
Is a story from a dream

228
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:54,024
I Like It! I Like It! キミに会えた
I Like It! I Like It! I was able to meet you

229
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:57,824
「ずっと、離さないでいてね」
“Never let me go, okay?”

230
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,824
ほら、キラキラ虹みたい
Look, it's sparkling like a rainbow

231
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:04,524
世界はまわりだす
The world begins to turn

00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:08,524
行くぞ！
Let's go!

233
00:16:08,824 --> 00:16:10,524
ガッチャコ、ガッチャコ！
Gatchako, gatchako!

234
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:13,524
わちゃわちゃパワー！
Wacha wacha power!

235
00:16:14,024 --> 00:16:18,024
やーやーやー！
Yah yah yah!

236
00:16:19,574 --> 00:16:21,274
スキ、スキ、スキ、勝負だ、手に入れたい
Like, like, like, it's a showdown, I want to make it mine

237
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:24,474
この感情、歯止めさえ、ガチンコ真剣勝負
This feeling, even the brakes, a real serious fight

238
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:26,474
ためらわないのがいいんでしょ？
It's better not to hesitate, right?

239
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:28,474
そう、恋も猛烈実験
Yes, love is also a intense experiment

240
00:16:28,574 --> 00:16:30,474
でもそれが僕の等身大
But that's my true self

241
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,474
ガチ、素晴らしい世界を確認
Seriously, confirming a wonderful world

242
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,474
いわゆる一、つの萌え要素
A so-called single 'moe' element

243
00:16:34,574 --> 00:16:40,474
素直になれたなら、Happy Days
If I could be honest, Happy Days

244
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:44,024
I Like It! I Like It! スキになれば
I Like It! I Like It! If you fall in love

245
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:47,824
きっと全てがカラフルで
I'm sure everything will be colorful

246
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:51,024
Lucky! Lucky! 星屑さえ
Lucky! Lucky! Even stardust

247
00:16:51,224 --> 00:16:54,524

Lyrics: Tommy february6
Music: MALIBU CONVERTIBLE

270
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:49,024
街角にならぶ
Lining up on the street corner

271
00:18:49,224 --> 00:18:52,524
映画のポスター
Are movie posters

272
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:56,524
もうこの街にも
Already, of this town too

273
00:18:57,024 --> 00:19:00,024
飽きたわ
I'm bored

274
00:19:00,524 --> 00:19:04,524
砂漠の向こうに
Beyond the desert

275
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:08,524
ため息をお返し
I return a sigh

276
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:12,524

Don't cancel it

277

本気の恋 神様は気づいてる
This serious love, God has noticed

282
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:35,524
Je t'aime ★ Je t'aime
I love you ★ I love you

283
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:39,524
叶わない夢なんて
A dream that won't come true

284
00:19:39,824 --> 00:19:41,024
見たくないわ
Is something I don't want to see

285
00:19:41,524 --> 00:19:46,524
でもロマンス目覚めてゆく
But romance is waking up

286
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:50,024

止まぬ雨の音
The sound of the rain that won't stop

290
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,532
je t'aime ★ je t'aime

291
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:09,532
退屈な恋なんて
A boring romance is something...

292
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:14,032
したくないわ
...I don't want to have.

293
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:18,532
あっと言う間に
Before I knew it,

294
00:20:18,532 --> 00:20:22,032
溺れてく
I'm drowning in it.

295
00:20:22,232 --> 00:20:30,032
“今がすべて”
"Now is everything."

296
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:33,532
カフェ・オ・レが冷めて
Before the café au lait...

00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:38,232
しまうその前に
...gets cold.

もう一度
Give me one more...

299
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:45,332
KISSして
...kiss.

300
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:48,532
je t'aime ★ je t'aime

301
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:53,032
物語に鍵をかけて
Locking the story away.

302
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:57,232
je vous en prie

303
00:20:57,232 --> 00:21:00,532
あなたのことばかりを
All I do is...

304
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:04,232
夢見ている
...dream of you.

305
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:07,532

叶わない夢なんて
Dreams that won't come true...

見たくないわ
...I don't want to see them.

309
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:25,532

But romance...

310
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:29,232
目覚めてゆく
...is waking up.

311
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:37,032
愛してるわ
I love you.

312
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:40,532
クレープに描く
Drawing on a crepe,

313
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:45,332
愛の傘の下で
Under the umbrella of love.

314
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:48,532
止まぬ雨の音
The sound of rain that won't stop.

315
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:52,332
je t'aime ★ je t'aime

316
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:57,032
mon amour pour toi

317
00:21:57,332 --> 00:22:00,532
退屈な恋なんて
A boring romance is something...

318
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:05,132
したくないわ
...I don't want to have.

319
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:09,532
あっと言う間に
Before I knew it,

320
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:13,032
溺れてく
I'm drowning in it.

321
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:21,032
“今がすべて”
"Now is everything."

322
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:24,532
カフェ・オ・レが冷めて
Before the café au lait...

323
00:22:24,532 --> 00:22:29,232
しまうその前に
...gets cold.

324
00:22:29,232 --> 00:22:32,532
もう一度
Let me hear you...

325
00:22:32,532 --> 00:22:36,532
聞かせて
...say it once more.

326
00:22:36,532 --> 00:22:39,532
je t'aime ★ je t'aime

327
00:22:39,532 --> 00:23:10,032
La la la...

328
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:22,032
Bau! Wow! Look at this sunset!

329
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:24,532
Oh, it's setting already, huh?

330
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:26,532
Perfect timing!

331
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:30,032
Well, that last song was "je t'aime ★ je t'aime"!

332
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:32,032
Oh, what did you think, Ruffians?

333
00:23:32,032 --> 00:23:34,032
What did you think, Ruffians?

334
00:23:34,032 --> 00:23:36,132
It was a little bit more nostalgic.

335
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:39,032
Yeah, maybe even a bit melancholic of a song.

336
00:23:39,032 --> 00:23:41,532
Who knows? Some City Pop vibes too!

337
00:23:41,532 --> 00:23:45,032
Yeah! Oh, the choreography is cute too, right? Oh, wow!

338
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:51,032
We hope it made you feel nice and warm and fluffy, Ruffians.

339
00:23:51,032 --> 00:23:53,032
Yeah! Wow!

340
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,532
You know, with the sun setting now,

341
00:23:55,532 --> 00:23:59,532
it's starting to feel a bit romantic almost, right?

342
00:23:59,532 --> 00:24:04,032
Wow! I guess it's the perfect time to call up my next guest!

343
00:24:04,032 --> 00:24:06,132

626
00:47:19,472 --> 00:47:24,072
But there's still one mystery guest we haven't met yet, right?

627
00:47:24,072 --> 00:47:27,772
まだ会ってない謎のゲストが一人いるんだよね！
There's still one mystery guest we haven't met yet!

628
00:47:27,772 --> 00:47:31,972
Yeah! Oh! Wow! So shall we give the Ruffians a hint? Oh! Huh?

629
00:47:31,972 --> 00:47:35,372
Ruffians, you're curious, right? Yeah!

630
00:47:35,372 --> 00:47:40,472
Who could it be? Who could it be? Yagoo-san? Ah, Yagoo-san! That's a good guess maybe, but...

631
00:47:40,472 --> 00:47:43,772
Well, you'll see! Oh! Maybe you should get ready!

632
00:47:43,772 --> 00:47:50,072
Because you know, they aren't quite as bad as Pero, but they can get pretty nasty sometimes! Oh!

633
00:47:50,072 --> 00:47:58,372
Mococo-chan, you're not going to be rude to our next guest or anything, right?

634
00:47:58,372 --> 00:48:04,172
Especially before calling them out! Well, we'll see! Oh!

635
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:10,572
Wow! Let's get them out here then! Who could it be? Who could it be? Okay!

00:49:05,172 --> 00:49:10,072
クロちゃんがどんな人なのか説明してもらえますか？ Yeah!
Could you explain what kind of person Kuro-chan is? Yeah!

652
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,172

Huh? Oh! Please don't be confused! Eh, Kuro-chan, 'Tulip'?

657
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:38,272
いやチューリップ no no no... ちょっとまだ分からないかもしれないから...
No, Tulip no no no... Wait, they might not understand yet...

658
00:49:38,272 --> 00:49:41,372
えーとね、安田大サーカスっていうトリオを組んでる、

662
00:49:53,672 --> 00:49:59,239

Me?! Myself?! Yes?! Hey, if you say that so suddenly...

663
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,380
はい、パップフラワー！
Yes, Pappu Flower!

664
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,980
ノー、ノー、ノー、言い訳はなし！

いいしん！
Nice, shin!

675
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,480
クロちゃん、テレビでよく見てるけど...
Kuro-chan, we see you on TV a lot, but...

676
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,580
ちょっとフワモコのペットのペロちゃんと...
...you look a little bit like FuwaMoco's pet Pero-chan...

677
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,080
...えーと、ちょっと似てるところがたくさんあるね！
...and you have a lot of similarities!

678
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,580
うん！え、ちょっと後ろの...
Yeah! Uh, look at the back...

679
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,480
飾り見てください。見えますか？
decoration. Can you see it?

680
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,580
そうすると、ペロです！
If you do that, it's Pero!

681
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,780
ペロ！
Pero!

682
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,880
ちょっ、待って、球体っていうか、丸いところが似てるだけじゃない？
Wait, it's just the round, spherical part that looks like me, right?

683
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:41,880
ねえ、ペロじゃない！
Hey, isn't it Pero?

684
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:42,980
本当？
Really?

685
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:43,980
うん！
Yeah!

686
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,580
えーと、クロちゃんと似てるところは...
The things similar to Kuro-chan are...

687
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,380
嘘つきで...
...he's a liar...

688
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,180
女の子好きで...
...likes girls...

689
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,180
野卑し、うーん！
...and vulgar, yuck!

690
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,480
だからね、見た目で騙されないで！
So don't be fooled by appearances!

691
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,980
クロちゃんはそんなんで大丈夫なの？言われて。
Kuro-chan, are you okay being told all that?

692
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,380
いや、ひどい、悲しくなってきた。
That's terrible, I'm getting sad.

693
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,480
え、え、え、え、え！
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh!

694
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,980
遠歩後援、ふんっ！
Enpo Kouen, humph!

695
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,580
全然人のギャグを聞かないよね、君たちは。
You guys don't listen to my gags at all, do you?

696
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,480
できれば、クロちゃんは...
If possible, Kuro-chan...

697
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:14,780
ペロの友達になってくれませんか？
...won't you become Pero's friend?

698
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,180
フワモコの友達じゃなくてペロの友達なの？
Not FuwaMoco's friend, but Pero's friend?

699
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,780
あ、フワモコはクロちゃんと友達になりたくないから！
Ah, because FuwaMoco doesn't want to be friends with Kuro-chan!

700
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,480
おかしくない、それ？
Isn't that strange?

701
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,480
いや、いや、気持ち悪いから！
No, no, because it's gross!

702
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,780
いや、気持ち悪くない、マニアには受ける！
It's not gross, it'll be popular with the manias!

703
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,480
いや、違う！
No way!

704
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,980
フワモコ気持ち悪い、やっぱり！
FuwaMoco thinks it's gross after all!

705
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,980
でも、でも、モコちゃん...
But, but, Moko-chan...

706
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,980
ちょっとやりすぎですよ、失礼ですよ。
...you're going a bit too far, it's rude.

707
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,380
いや、もし、もし、ペロと仲良くなってほしいんだったら...
Well, if, if you want me to get along with Pero...

708
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:42,280
フワモコちゃん、クロちゃんに可愛らしく頼んだほうがいいんじゃない？
...FuwaMoco-chan should ask Kuro-chan cutely, shouldn't you?

709
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,980
はぁ〜〜？！
Haa~~?!

710
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,180
ノー！
No!

711
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,380
え、ノー！
Eh, no!

712
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,380
ノー！
No!

713
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,780
しっかりとした否定。
Such a firm denial.

714
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,580
え、ま、けど、ペロ可愛いから、仲良くなってもいいとは思ってるよ。
Well, Pero is cute, so I think it's okay to get along.

715
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,680
あ、嬉しい、嬉しい、嬉しい！
Oh, happy, happy, happy!

716
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,580
可愛くないけど、なんか仲良くなってくれたら嬉しいかな！
He's not cute, but I'd be happy if you got along!

717
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,980
感情が、感情がいろいろありすぎなのよ、本当に。
You have, you have way too many conflicting emotions, really.

718
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,380
まあまあ。
Now, now.

719
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,980
クロちゃんって芸人さんだけど、アイドルになりたいんですよね？
Kuro-chan is a comedian, but you want to be an idol, right?

720
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,580
ね！
Right!

721
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,480
そう、もともとアイドルになろうと思ったのに、騙されて芸人にさせられたから。
Yeah, originally I intended to be an idol, but I was tricked into becoming a comedian.

722
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:12,980
アイドルは本当に夢、ドリーム。
Being an idol is really a dream, a dream.

723
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,580
あ、なんか悲しいな、かわいそう。
Oh, that's a bit sad, poor thing.

724
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,480
失礼です、でもドリームって大事ですから！
That's rude, but dreams are important!

725
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,980
大事！
Important!

726
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,480
うん。さ、で、ま、クロちゃんのドリームはアイドルなんだから...
Yeah. So, since Kuro-chan's dream is to be an idol...

727
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:26,980
...もうせっかく一緒に歌ってくれませんか？
...won't you sing together with us since we're here?

728
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,980

Yeah, this song, the next song!

731
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,380
あの、ハードル上げないで！
Um, don't raise the hurdle!

732
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,980
え、大丈夫ですよ、ね！
Eh, it's fine, right!

733
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,480
アイドルのプロデューサーもやってるし！
You're an idol producer too!

734
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:44,980
そうそう、実力見せてよ！
Right, right, show us your skills!

735
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,580

Hey, show us!

736

オッケーだしんよ、行くしんよ、行くしんよ！
It's okay, shin, I'm going, shin, I'm going, shin!

737
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,680
オッケー！
Okay!

738
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:56,180
じゃあ、すごく可愛い曲を一緒に歌いましょう！
Then, let's sing a very cute song together!

739
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,380
え、何なんだろ、楽しみに！
Eh, what is it? I'm looking forward to it!

740
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,680
オッケー！
Okay!

741
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,480
うん。
Yeah.

742
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,480
じゃあ、一緒にタイトルコールしましょうね！
Then, let's do the title call together!

743
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,480
ね！
Right!

744
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,480
うん。
Yeah.

745
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,580
せーの！
Ready, set...

746
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,980
ちゅ、多様性！
Chu, Tayousei!

747
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,980
ちゅ、多様性あんの？！
You're doing 'Chu, Tayousei'?!

748
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,080
ちゅ、多様性。
Chu, Tayousei.

我愛你　酔いが醒めない
I love you, I can't sober up

751
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:35,380
Oh I need you　恋が醒めない
Oh I need you, I can't wake up from love

お生様の成れ果て召して
Feast upon the ruins of a raw existence

753

Strong opposition, with 'paw' and 'sit'

756
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:52,630
ヘイ♥報酬
Hey, reward

757
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,580
喉の奥がチクンチクン
The back of my throat prickles

758
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,080
僕はドクンドクン
My heart goes thump-thump

759
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:06,080
鼓動で孤独消してみてよ
Try erasing loneliness with your heartbeat

760
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,830
愛も恋も全廃して
Abolish all love and romance

761
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,130
僕を独占して
Monopolize me

762
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:16,330
このまま中毒になるまで
Until you become addicted like this

763
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,080
ちゅ（しよう）
Let's kiss

764
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,080
Get get get on!

765
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,080
Get get get on!

766
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,230
Get get get on! Get on chu!

767
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,080
熱くとろけるくらいに溢れた気持ちが
Feelings overflowing enough to melt hotly

768
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,080
たまらないでしょ
It's irresistible, right?

769
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,080
Get get get on!

770
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,080
Get get get on!

771
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,230
Get get get on! Get on chu!

772
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,280
我愛你　無問題
I love you, no problem

773
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:43,830
Get Get Get on chu!

774
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,530
ポン・チー・カン　勝負はいつも
Pon, Chi, Kan, the match is always...

775
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,830
トンチンカン　僕に言わせて
...absurd, let me say it

776
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,080
ちんぷんかんぷんだ　最後はロンでしょ？
It's all Greek to me, the end is 'Ron', right?

777
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:59,080
もう何回？　殺られればいい
How many more times? It's fine to be killed

778
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,888
Oh, One night 忘れられない
Oh, one night, I can't forget it

779
00:55:02,888 --> 00:55:08,588
終わんないでトキメキ偏愛♡予習
Don't let it end, this heart-fluttering偏愛 prep♡

780
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,888
喉の奥がチクンチクン
Deep in my throat, it pricks and pricks

781
00:55:11,888 --> 00:55:14,888
僕はドクンドクン
My heart is thumping and thumping

782
00:55:14,888 --> 00:55:20,588
心臓ごと引きずり出してみせてよ
Try and drag out my entire heart

783
00:55:20,888 --> 00:55:24,488
気持ちいいね 面倒くさいけど
It feels good, even if it's a hassle

784
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:27,888
やっぱ照れくさいけど
I guess it's embarrassing, after all

785
00:55:27,888 --> 00:55:33,488
死ぬまで忘れられないチューしよう
Let's have a kiss we'll never forget until we die

786
00:55:34,088 --> 00:55:36,588
いかれた街はゾンビで溢れる
This crazy town is overflowing with zombies

787
00:55:36,888 --> 00:55:40,088
君は僕に恋してる
You are in love with me

788
00:55:40,088 --> 00:55:43,688
ときめく胸に繋がるロープを
Pull the rope connected...

789
00:55:43,688 --> 00:55:45,588
引きなよ
...to your throbbing chest

790
00:55:46,388 --> 00:55:46,988
いくよ
Here we go!

791
00:55:46,988 --> 00:55:51,888
Bet bet bet on chu!

792
00:55:51,888 --> 00:55:58,088
本気で狂えるくらいの美しさが
Such a level of beauty that could truly drive one mad

793
00:55:58,288 --> 00:55:59,588
美しいでしょ
Is beautiful, isn't it?

794
00:55:59,588 --> 00:56:04,588
Get get get on chu!

795
00:56:05,188 --> 00:56:05,888
せーの
One, two...

796
00:56:05,888 --> 00:56:08,588
ポン・チー・カン 終わんない
Pon-Chi-Kan, it won't end

797
00:56:08,588 --> 00:56:10,588
Get Get Get on chu!

798
00:56:10,888 --> 00:56:11,888
ほらね
See?

799
00:56:11,888 --> 00:56:14,588
我愛你 無問題
I love you, no problem

800
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:18,088
Get Get Get on chu!

801
00:56:24,088 --> 00:56:28,088
わー！うまくいったしんよー！
Wow! It went well-shin!

802
00:56:28,588 --> 00:56:32,288
ありがとうー！よかったー！がんばったね、クロちゃん！
Thank you! That was great! You did your best, Kuro-chan!

803
00:56:32,588 --> 00:56:35,588
楽しかった、ありがとう！
That was fun, thank you!

804
00:56:36,588 --> 00:56:40,088
えー、ちょっとね、さよならする前に...
Um, well, before we say goodbye...

805
00:56:40,088 --> 00:56:42,588
えっと、一個お願いしてもいいですか？
...could we ask you for one favor?

806
00:56:43,088 --> 00:56:44,288
一個だけだしんよ？
Just one thing-shin?

807
00:56:45,088 --> 00:56:46,588
一個だけじゃん！
Just one thing, okay!

808
00:56:47,888 --> 00:56:53,088
えっと、フワモコは魔界の番犬で、バウバウをよく言ってるんですけど
Well, Fuwamoco are guard dogs of the Underworld, and we often say "Bau Bau."

809
00:56:54,088 --> 00:57:00,088
クロちゃん、カメラに向かってフワモコのように可愛いバウバウをしてもらえますか？
Kuro-chan, could you do a cute "Bau Bau" for the camera, just like Fuwamoco?

810
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:04,588
えー、できるかなー？行くしんよ！
Eh, can I do it? Here I go-shin!

811
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:06,888
バウバウ！
Bau Bau!

812
00:57:07,588 --> 00:57:09,588
あー！バウバウ！それがベスト！
Ah! Bau Bau! That was the best!

813
00:57:10,088 --> 00:57:12,588
もう一回！もっとやって！
One more time! Do it more!

814
00:57:14,288 --> 00:57:16,288
バウバウ！
Bau Bau!

815
00:57:17,888 --> 00:57:19,588
可愛いかな？
Was that cute?

816
00:57:19,588 --> 00:57:23,088
実はもう一個やりたいことがあるんですけど
Actually, there's one more thing we want to do.

817
00:57:23,088 --> 00:57:24,088
なに？
What is it?

818
00:57:24,288 --> 00:57:29,288
さきほどやりましたけど、フワモコはいつもやってる自己紹介があって
We did it earlier, but Fuwamoco has a self-introduction we always do.

819
00:57:30,288 --> 00:57:32,888
できれば三人で一緒にやりたいです！
If possible, we want to do it with all three of us!

820
00:57:33,288 --> 00:57:35,088
あれ可愛かったからやりたいしんよ！
That was cute, so I want to do it-shin!

821
00:57:36,588 --> 00:57:38,288
じゃあ、いきますよ！
Okay, here we go!

822
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:41,588
チワワじゃないよ、フワワだよ！
I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!

823
00:57:41,588 --> 00:57:45,088
ワワワワワ！フワワじゃないよ、クロちゃんだよ！
Wawawawawa! I'm not Fuwawa, I'm Kuro-chan!

824
00:57:45,588 --> 00:57:48,588
クロちゃんじゃないよ、モココだよ！
I'm not Kuro-chan, I'm Mococo!

825
00:57:48,888 --> 00:57:52,888
三人に合わせて、アイヤイヤイヤイ！バウバウ！
All three of us together, Aiyaiyaiyai! Bau Bau!

826
00:57:53,088 --> 00:57:55,088
なんなの、怒らないで、どうしたの？
What's wrong? Don't get mad. What happened?

827
00:57:55,588 --> 00:57:57,288
でででで、クロちゃん！
Dededede, Kuro-chan!

828
00:57:57,288 --> 00:57:58,588
出てこないから、なんなのそれ？
I'm not coming out. What's that about?

829
00:57:59,088 --> 00:58:01,588
おい、もう嘘つくのやめてよね！
Hey, stop lying already!

830
00:58:02,088 --> 00:58:05,088
じゃないと、モココ、パンチしちゃうぞ！
Otherwise, Mococo will punch you!

831
00:58:05,588 --> 00:58:06,888
えだ... ちょちょちょちょ...
Wait... whoa whoa whoa...

832
00:58:07,588 --> 00:58:09,088
やー！
Yaah!

833
00:58:10,088 --> 00:58:11,588
救急車一台...
Call an ambulance...

834
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:15,588
いらないよ、もう嘘ばっかり、なんなのそれ？
We don't need one! You're just full of lies, what was that?

835
00:58:16,088 --> 00:58:18,588
バウバウ... なんでバウバウ怒るの、ちょっと
Bau Bau... why are you getting mad at "Bau Bau"?

836
00:58:19,088 --> 00:58:21,088
落ち着いて、落ち着いて
Calm down, calm down.

837
00:58:22,088 --> 00:58:24,588
大丈夫、モコちゃん、大丈夫
It's okay, Mococo-chan, it's okay.

838
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:31,588
クロちゃんはこれからもみんなをいっぱい笑顔にして、素敵なアイドルになってくださいね！
Kuro-chan, please keep making everyone smile and become a wonderful idol!

839
00:58:32,088 --> 00:58:33,588
なるしんよ！バウバウ！
I will-shin! Bau Bau!

840
00:58:34,288 --> 00:58:35,588
じゃあ、モコちゃん
Well then, Mococo-chan...

841
00:58:35,588 --> 00:58:39,088
最後にクロちゃんとハイタッチしてお別れしようね
...let's end with a high touch with Kuro-chan before saying goodbye.

842
00:58:39,588 --> 00:58:41,588
オッケー、仲直り、仲直り、いい？
Okay. Reconciliation, reconciliation, okay?

843
00:58:42,588 --> 00:58:44,888
仲直りね、オッケーしんよ。はい、ハイタッチ！
Reconciliation, right. Okay-shin. Here, high touch!

844
00:58:46,088 --> 00:58:51,588
ほらほらほらほら！やってみて、やってみて！仲直り！
Come on, come on! Give it a try! Reconciliation!

845
00:58:52,588 --> 00:58:53,888
ベー！
Bleh!

846
00:58:55,588 --> 00:58:58,588
ひどくない、もうちょっと！なんなの？バイバイ！
Isn't that cruel? Seriously! What gives? Bye-bye!

847
00:58:59,588 --> 00:59:02,888
フワモコちゃん、本当にお誕生日おめでとうございます！
Fuwamoco-chan, happy birthday, for real!

848
00:59:03,588 --> 00:59:06,888
おめでとう！ありがとうー！バウバウ！
Congratulations! Thank you! Bau Bau!

849
00:59:07,588 --> 00:59:11,888
クロちゃんからの、バッキューン！おめでとう、ハート！
A "Bakyuun" from Kuro-chan! Congrats, heart!

850
00:59:12,588 --> 00:59:14,288
ステイゴールド！
Stay gold!

851
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:21,088
Fireworks!

852
00:59:21,088 --> 00:59:24,088
Bau Bau! Look at the fireworks!

853
00:59:24,588 --> 00:59:28,088
たーまやー！かーぎやー！
Tamaya! Kagiya!

854
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,129
First anniversary...

855
01:00:01,129 --> 01:00:02,629
...we released our very...

856
01:00:02,629 --> 01:00:03,629
...first original song,

857
01:00:03,629 --> 01:00:05,662
Born to be BAU-DOL!

858
01:00:05,662 --> 01:00:06,429
Yeah!

859
01:00:06,429 --> 01:00:07,562
And then for our second anniversary...

860
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,662
...we were able to release Lifetime Showtime!

861
01:00:09,662 --> 01:00:11,196
Oh!

862
01:00:11,196 --> 01:00:13,629
Our original song that's grown with us along this journey.

863
01:00:13,629 --> 01:00:14,429
Yeah.

864
01:00:14,429 --> 01:00:16,629
A very special song.

865
01:00:16,629 --> 01:00:18,162
And you know,

866
01:00:18,162 --> 01:00:23,096
for FUWAMOCO, singing and dancing is something that means so much to us.

867
01:00:23,096 --> 01:00:24,129
Yeah, music!

868
01:00:24,129 --> 01:00:25,962
And Ruffians,

869
01:00:25,962 --> 01:00:29,796
you might've heard that you'd like to hear more from us too, right?

870
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:30,962
Yeah! Yeah!

871
01:00:30,962 --> 01:00:32,529
What do you think, yeah?

872
01:00:32,529 --> 01:00:34,662
Oh... wow!

873
01:00:34,662 --> 01:00:36,262
Our announcement is...

874
01:00:36,262 --> 01:00:37,496
Drumroll...

875
01:00:37,496 --> 01:00:38,296
Drumroll!

876
01:00:38,296 --> 01:00:46,129
(Popepopepopepope!)

877
01:00:46,129 --> 01:00:47,429
Done!

878
01:00:47,429 --> 01:00:49,229
A new original song!

879
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,629
Oh!

880
01:00:51,629 --> 01:00:54,162
Its title is "DEMON'S RESIDENCE"!

881
01:00:54,162 --> 01:00:55,196
And...

882
01:00:55,196 --> 01:00:57,196
This song is extra special.

883
01:00:57,196 --> 01:00:58,429
Yeah!

884
01:00:58,429 --> 01:01:03,096
It's written by none other than the legendary rock idol song composer, Matsukuma Kenta-san...

885
01:01:03,096 --> 01:01:06,596
...who works with many famous idol groups that we love!

886
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:07,596
Oh!

887
01:01:07,596 --> 01:01:09,262
Also written music

888
01:01:09,262 --> 01:01:11,062
for the idol group that Kuro-chan produced,

889
01:01:11,062 --> 01:01:13,662
MAMESHIBA NO TAIGUN-san!

890
01:01:13,662 --> 01:01:14,429
Yeah!

891
01:01:14,429 --> 01:01:15,662
But Ruffians,

892
01:01:15,662 --> 01:01:18,629
you might be a little bit surprised, okay?

893
01:01:18,629 --> 01:01:19,562
Oh!

894
01:01:19,562 --> 01:01:21,096
So get ready!

895
01:01:21,096 --> 01:01:22,496
Ruffians,

896
01:01:22,496 --> 01:01:23,796
with this song,

897
01:01:23,796 --> 01:01:26,596
we'd like to express our Ruff-est feelings...

898
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:27,596
...as demon dogs!

899
01:01:30,096 --> 01:01:31,429
DEMON'S RESIDENCE

900
01:01:45,096 --> 01:01:50,096
DEMON'S RESIDENCE
Lyrics: FUWAMOCO Music: 松隈ケンタ
Arrangement: SCRAMBLES
DEMON'S RESIDENCE
Lyrics: FUWAMOCO Music: Kenta Matsukuma
Arrangement: SCRAMBLES

901
01:01:56,596 --> 01:01:58,596
「相棒、どこへ行こうか」
"My partner, where shall we go?"

902
01:01:58,596 --> 01:02:00,696
ネオンの脇を抜け
We pass by the neon lights

903
01:02:00,696 --> 01:02:03,229
バブルガムがはじけたら
When the bubblegum pops

904
01:02:03,229 --> 01:02:06,096
let's go

905
01:02:06,596 --> 01:02:08,629
最低な夜を潜って
Passing through the worst of nights

906
01:02:08,629 --> 01:02:11,096
僕らは群れをなす
We form a pack

907
01:02:11,096 --> 01:02:13,729
「あの頃よりもマシだね」
"It's better than back then"

908
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:16,262
my way

909
01:02:16,629 --> 01:02:18,829
「不完全なんです」
"We are incomplete"

910
01:02:18,829 --> 01:02:21,829
首輪をつけた
We put on our collars

911
01:02:22,096 --> 01:02:24,262
良い子なんじゃもう
We don't want to be good girls anymore

912
01:02:24,262 --> 01:02:26,629
イヤ Ah!!
No way, ah!!

913
01:02:27,096 --> 01:02:29,329
DEMON'S RESIDENCE 噛みついていけ
DEMON'S RESIDENCE, bite through it

914

stray dogs

彼方へと飛ぶ鳥を
The birds flying to the distance

921
01:02:42,229 --> 01:02:43,362
見上げるだけかい
Are you just looking up?

922
01:02:43,362 --> 01:02:44,829
それでいいのかい？
Is that enough for you?

923
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:47,429
燃えるならほら
If we're going to burn, look,

924
01:02:47,429 --> 01:02:49,696
青く
let's burn blue

925
01:02:57,596 --> 01:02:59,729
「説教なんかいらない」
"We don't need any lectures"

926
01:02:59,729 --> 01:03:02,429
スプレー缶振って
Shake the spray can

彩る runway

誰に bet するのか
Who are you betting on?

931
01:03:12,829 --> 01:03:15,396
不確定要素ばかりね
It's full of uncertain elements,

932
01:03:15,396 --> 01:03:17,729
lonely

933
01:03:18,096 --> 01:03:20,629
二人でひとつと
We decided the two of us

934
01:03:20,629 --> 01:03:23,096
決めた

935
01:03:23,096 --> 01:03:25,662
あの日を忘れない
We won't forget that day

936

A sky full of stars

939
01:03:30,662 --> 01:03:33,162

味がするのかい？
Can you taste it?

942
01:03:35,629 --> 01:03:38,096

唸っていたいんだ
We want to keep growling,

944

stray dogs

945
01:03:40,662 --> 01:03:43,329
僕ら空さえも撃ち落として
We'll even shoot down the sky

946
01:03:43,329 --> 01:03:44,429

あの日を忘れない
We won't forget that day

952
01:04:21,662 --> 01:04:23,929
鳴呼

夜を睨んだ
Staring into the night,

954
01:04:28,362 --> 01:04:29,662
stray dogs

955
01:04:29,662 --> 01:04:30,729
そうだ
That's right

956
01:04:30,729 --> 01:04:32,162
怪物はこの世のほうさ
The monsters are the world itself

957
01:04:32,162 --> 01:04:33,429

Can you escape?

958

01:04:37,129 --> 01:04:38,362
DEMON'S RESIDENCE

961
01:04:38,362 --> 01:04:39,629
stray dogs

962
01:04:39,629 --> 01:04:40,762
僕ら
We

963
01:04:40,762 --> 01:04:42,196
この街を駆け抜けていけ
Race through this city

964
01:04:42,196 --> 01:04:44,629
地獄の果てに何が見えるかい

Tear off the chains

966
01:04:47,129 --> 01:04:48,329

We want to keep screaming,

967
01:04:48,329 --> 01:04:49,662
stray dogs

968
01:04:49,662 --> 01:04:50,696
僕ら
We

969
01:04:50,696 --> 01:04:52,196
この街は檻のようで
This city is like a cage

970
01:04:52,196 --> 01:04:53,396
君ならどうだい
How about you?

971
01:04:53,396 --> 01:04:54,696
共に駆けるかい
Will you run with us?

972
01:04:54,696 --> 01:04:57,529
夜明けが合図だ
Dawn is the signal

973
01:04:57,529 --> 01:05:00,096
行こう
Let's go

974
01:05:52,304 --> 01:05:53,404
Bau Bau!

975
01:05:53,604 --> 01:05:57,304
Thank you for always being here for us Ruffians!

976
01:05:57,904 --> 01:05:58,804
Please listen to...

977
01:05:59,104 --> 01:06:02,104
side by side!

978
01:06:04,304 --> 01:06:07,604
Finally we made it through

979
01:06:07,604 --> 01:06:10,604
but not without some tears

980
01:06:12,104 --> 01:06:15,604
With the help of friends so true

981
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:18,604
we faced all of our fears

982
01:06:20,304 --> 01:06:23,104
Now we're here to celebrate

983
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,604
all that we have done

984
01:06:26,204 --> 01:06:30,304
I can feel it's more than just a game of fate

985
01:06:30,504 --> 01:06:34,104
'cause our stories have just begun

986
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:38,904
Hand in hand we're not waiting on tomorrow

987
01:06:39,104 --> 01:06:42,604
From now on it's the heart that we will follow

988
01:06:43,104 --> 01:06:46,604
We'll move on passed the heartbreak

989
01:06:46,604 --> 01:06:47,904
and the sorrow

990
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:50,104
If you stay by my side

991
01:06:51,304 --> 01:06:54,104
Dancing harmonies feeding the music

992
01:06:54,104 --> 01:06:57,304
as we come alive, and sparks ignite

993
01:06:58,304 --> 01:07:02,104
We're making memories everyday underneath

994
01:07:02,104 --> 01:07:05,604
the summer sky and through the night

995
01:07:06,404 --> 01:07:10,104
We're singing melodies every time we hear music

996
01:07:10,104 --> 01:07:13,304
from inside as hearts collide

997
01:07:14,104 --> 01:07:17,104
Bringing out the best in each other

998
01:07:17,104 --> 01:07:21,104
now we're feeling free like we're meant to be

999
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:24,104
Even though there were tough times

1000
01:07:24,104 --> 01:07:25,604
when nobody wanted us

1001
01:07:25,904 --> 01:07:28,104
We kept going, and we kept dreaming

1002
01:07:29,104 --> 01:07:31,604
Now we're here, we're not alone anymore

1003
01:07:32,204 --> 01:07:33,904
We'll be here together,

1004
01:07:33,904 --> 01:07:35,304
with our smiles to protect

1005
01:07:35,404 --> 01:07:36,604
C'mon, let's go!

1006
01:07:37,404 --> 01:07:40,104
Dancing harmonies feeding the music

1007
01:07:40,104 --> 01:07:43,604
as we come alive, and sparks ignite

1008
01:07:44,304 --> 01:07:48,104
We're making memories everyday underneath

1009
01:07:48,104 --> 01:07:51,304
the summer sky and through the night

1010
01:07:52,404 --> 01:07:56,104
We're singing melodies every time we hear music

1011
01:07:56,104 --> 01:07:59,304
from inside as hearts collide

1012
01:08:00,104 --> 01:08:03,104
Bringing out the best in each other

1013
01:08:03,104 --> 01:08:07,104
now we're feeling free like we're meant to be

1014
01:08:07,604 --> 01:08:38,304
Nya nya nya nya nya...

1015
01:08:39,404 --> 01:08:40,604
Bau Bau!

1016
01:08:46,104 --> 01:08:48,304
Bau Bau! Thank you for the encore Ruffians!

1017
01:08:48,604 --> 01:08:52,604
That was side by side! Bau Bau!

1018
01:08:54,104 --> 01:08:58,304
We're really happy we could perform side by side

1019
01:08:58,304 --> 01:08:59,304
for the first time live today!

1020
01:08:59,504 --> 01:09:00,704
え、初披露できてとっても
Uhh, I'm so happy we could perform it for the first time

1021
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:04,304
side by side is a song made by Alobahn-san,

1022
01:09:04,304 --> 01:09:06,604
but also between FUWAMOCO!

1023
01:09:08,904 --> 01:09:12,604
We know it's a song that you love a lot, but we also too,

1024
01:09:13,604 --> 01:09:17,604
because it's very special to us since it's the ending

1025
01:09:17,604 --> 01:09:20,104
theme for a visual novel that we care about...

1026
01:09:20,304 --> 01:09:23,604
Nekopara! Nekopara! Bau Bau!

1027
01:09:24,104 --> 01:09:27,604
And with this song, our dream of singing the opening

1028
01:09:27,604 --> 01:09:30,904
or ending theme for a bishoujo game came true!

1029
01:09:31,104 --> 01:09:34,604
そう、この曲で FUWAMOCO の夢、
Yes, with this song, FUWAMOCO's dream,

1030
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:38,304
美少女ゲームの主題歌を歌うことが叶いました！
of singing a theme song for a bishoujo game has come true!

1031
01:09:39,104 --> 01:09:41,304
Thank you! Thank you! ありがとう！
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

1032
01:09:43,604 --> 01:09:47,604
And thank you so much for joining us

1033
01:09:47,604 --> 01:09:50,104
for our special day again this year!

1034
01:09:50,104 --> 01:09:51,304
It's been a dream of ours!

1035
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:54,304
And you know, it's all because of you

1036
01:09:54,304 --> 01:09:56,104
that we're able to be here

1037
01:09:56,104 --> 01:09:58,604
and do all the amazing things that we do, so thank you!

1038
01:10:00,527 --> 01:10:01,490
We say, but...

1039
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:01,897
Ah...

1040
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:03,653
This next song is our last song.

1041
01:10:05,398 --> 01:10:11,075
But like what we said at the special one, you know FuwaMoco...

1042
01:10:11,075 --> 01:10:14,412
...is Demon Guard Dogs! We're here to protect your smile, right?

1043
01:10:15,223 --> 01:10:16,307
We'll continue to do that.

1044
01:10:16,307 --> 01:10:17,494
Protect your smile.

1045
01:10:17,494 --> 01:10:19,543
Yeah, through our arts, idol,

1046
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:23,112
And just as our fluffy and fuzzy souls too.

1047
01:10:23,212 --> 01:10:24,112
Yeah.

1048
01:10:24,812 --> 01:10:29,012
We'll continue to be here for thousands and thousands of Demon Dog years,

1049
01:10:29,112 --> 01:10:33,312
while remembering that, you know, every day isn't given.

1050
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:34,612
Yeah.

1051
01:10:34,812 --> 01:10:36,712
We don't take anything for granted.

1052
01:10:36,812 --> 01:10:43,212
And you know, when you're down, we hope that you remember that we're always here cheering you on, okay?

1053
01:10:43,312 --> 01:10:45,412
We're cheering you on, Ruffians!

1054
01:10:45,912 --> 01:10:49,612
So please listen closely to the lyrics of our last song for today.

1055
01:11:05,112 --> 01:11:07,812
明日も　明後日も
Tomorrow and the day after too

1056
01:11:07,812 --> 01:11:11,612
あなたが笑ってますように
May you be smiling

1057
01:11:11,612 --> 01:11:13,612
ずっと...
Forever...

1058
01:11:13,712 --> 01:11:16,112
Lala...

1059
01:11:18,612 --> 01:11:22,612
Thank you so much Ruffians for spending our birthday with us today!

01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:26,612
Please think of this song whenever things are rough, and know that we'll be here.

1062
01:11:26,812 --> 01:11:30,112
This last song is for you! Wishful☆Garnet!

1063
01:11:33,112 --> 01:11:37,112
過去を振り返ると　思い出す
Looking back at the past, I remember

1064
01:11:37,112 --> 01:11:39,612
ガーネットの空
The garnet sky

1065
01:11:39,612 --> 01:11:43,912
溢れていく　光
The light that overflows

1066
01:11:44,912 --> 01:11:49,612
この目に映し出されたあの日は
On that day reflected in these eyes

1067
01:11:49,912 --> 01:11:54,112
美しく　揺れる
It sways beautifully

1068
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:59,112
What do you think?

1069
01:11:59,112 --> 01:12:02,612
赤く滲んだ空に
In the red-tinted sky

1070
01:12:02,912 --> 01:12:07,912
願いました　どうかこの願い
I made a wish, please let this wish

1071
01:12:07,912 --> 01:12:10,612
届けてください
Reach you

1072
01:12:11,112 --> 01:12:13,712
明日も　明後日も
Tomorrow and the day after too

1073
01:12:13,712 --> 01:12:17,412
あなたが笑ってますように
May you be smiling

1074
01:12:17,412 --> 01:12:22,612
離ればなれになっても　前を向けますように
Even if we are far apart, may you look forward

1075
01:12:23,212 --> 01:12:28,912
あなたを縛る鎖を　わたしが壊してあげる
The chains that bind you, I will break them for you

1076
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:34,112
もう負けないで進むこと
Keep moving forward without giving in

1077
01:12:34,612 --> 01:12:39,112
いつでもそばにいるから
Because I'm always by your side

1078
01:12:49,512 --> 01:12:56,612
落ち込んだり自信を無くした時だって
Even when you're depressed or lose confidence

1079
01:12:57,112 --> 01:13:00,612
目の前にいてくれる
You're right there in front of me

1080
01:13:00,912 --> 01:13:08,112
あなたの笑顔に何度も救われた
I was saved many times by your smile

1081
01:13:08,312 --> 01:13:11,912
だから So I love you
That's why, So I love you

1082
01:13:12,912 --> 01:13:17,612
挫けそうになったら
When you feel like you're about to give up

1083
01:13:17,912 --> 01:13:23,612
手を伸ばして　まだ知らない明日
Reach out your hand, to the tomorrow you don't know yet

1084
01:13:23,912 --> 01:13:26,612
一緒に見つけよう
Let's find it together

1085
01:13:27,112 --> 01:13:32,612
明日も　明後日も　あなたを照らしていたい
Tomorrow and the day after too, I want to keep lighting you up

1086
01:13:32,912 --> 01:13:38,312
泣きそうになった時は　こっち向いてほしい
When you're about to cry, I want you to look this way

1087
01:13:38,612 --> 01:13:44,312
世界でひとりぼっち　そんな風に思わないで
Don't feel like you're all alone in the world

1088
01:13:44,612 --> 01:13:50,112
愛してくれる人は　きっと
There are surely people who love you

1089
01:13:50,312 --> 01:13:55,612
いつもあなたを想ってる
Always thinking of you

1090
01:13:56,112 --> 01:14:03,112
Uuu... Yeah...

1091
01:14:04,312 --> 01:14:05,612
Wishful Garnet

1092
01:14:19,512 --> 01:14:24,612
La la la...

1093
01:14:25,412 --> 01:14:31,112
願いました　どうかこの願い
I made a wish, please let this wish

1094
01:14:31,612 --> 01:14:33,912
届けてください
Reach you

1095
01:14:34,312 --> 01:14:37,212
明日も　明後日も
Tomorrow and the day after too

1096
01:14:37,212 --> 01:14:40,612
あなたが笑ってますように
May you be smiling

1097
01:14:40,612 --> 01:14:46,212
離ればなれになっても　前を向けますように
Even if we are far apart, may you look forward

1098
01:14:46,612 --> 01:14:52,112
あなたを縛る鎖を　わたしが壊してあげる
The chains that bind you, I will break them for you

1099
01:14:52,612 --> 01:14:57,312
もう負けないで進むこと
Keep moving forward without giving in

1100
01:14:57,612 --> 01:14:59,612
輝く空へ
To the shining sky

1101
01:15:01,243 --> 01:15:06,393
明日も　明後日も　あなたが笑ってますように
Tomorrow and the day after, I hope you'll be smiling

1102
01:15:06,572 --> 01:15:12,405
離ればなれになっても前を向けますように
Even if we are far apart, I hope you'll be able to look forward

1103
01:15:12,548 --> 01:15:18,220
あなたを縛る鎖をわたしが壊してあげる　woh woh
I will break the chains that bind you, woh woh

1104
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:24,070
もう負けないで進むこと
Don't lose and keep moving forward

1105
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:29,920
いつでもそばに　あなたのそばに
Always by your side, right next to you

1106
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:35,870
わたしはいつもいるから
Because I'll always be there

1107
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:41,120
La la la...

1108
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:53,120
Oh yeah...

1109
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:12,700
Bau Bau!

1110
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,720
