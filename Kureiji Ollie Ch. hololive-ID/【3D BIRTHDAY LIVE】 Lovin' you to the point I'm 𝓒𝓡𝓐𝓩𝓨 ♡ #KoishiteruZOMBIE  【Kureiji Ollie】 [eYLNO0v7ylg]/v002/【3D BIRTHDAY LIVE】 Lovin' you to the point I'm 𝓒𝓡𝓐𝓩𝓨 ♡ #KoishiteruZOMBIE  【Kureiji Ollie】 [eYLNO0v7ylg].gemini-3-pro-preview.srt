君の愛を知った気でハイになっていて
Getting high feeling like I knew your love,

317
00:22:04,546 --> 00:22:07,146
感度去っていて毎度泣いていてさ

それくらいがいいんでしょ
That's about right, isn't it?

There you are! I was looking everywhere for you.

336
00:24:28,046 --> 00:24:31,246
Kamu nggak bilang kalau kita bakal main petak umpet~
You didn't tell me we were going to play hide and seek~

337
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:35,246
Ternyata kamu ada di neon stage, ya!
Turns out you're at the neon stage!

Pas kamu lagi sembunyi tadi, Ollie juga ganti baju.
While you were hiding earlier, Ollie also changed clothes.

341
00:24:47,546 --> 00:24:49,846
Loh~ Imut nggak~?
Oh~ Cute right~?

342
00:24:50,246 --> 00:24:54,246
Hehe~ Sebenernya masih banyak yang Ollie siapin buat kamu~
Hehe~ Actually there's still a lot Ollie prepared for you~

343
00:24:54,546 --> 00:24:58,546
Jadi kita udahan ya main petak umpetnya~
So let's finish playing hide and seek~

344
00:25:00,246 --> 00:25:02,046
Hah? Nggak mau?
Huh? You don't want to?

345
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:04,046
Eh, kamu, tuh...

Since getting here, you've been acting really weird...

348
00:25:07,854 --> 00:25:10,154
You're just... standing over there and... I just don't understand.

349
00:25:10,854 --> 00:25:12,854
You've been trying to get my attention...

350
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:15,554
...by liking my posts and commenting on them...

351
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:17,354
Isn't this what you wanted?

352
00:25:18,054 --> 00:25:19,554
You... You love me, right?

353
00:25:20,554 --> 00:25:23,054
Don't you want to spend more time with me?

354
00:25:24,054 --> 00:25:26,054
Why are you not accepting my feelings?

355
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:27,954
You're supposed to be happy, but...

356
00:25:28,054 --> 00:25:29,854
...you're acting so strange...

357
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,554
Eh! Bentar! Chotto! Matte!

00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:45,742
Gosh, where could you be?

468
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:47,142
Ayo tunjukin dirimu!
Come on, show yourself!

469
00:31:47,442 --> 00:31:48,142
Show yourself!

470
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:50,242
Beneran deh, ngasih kerjaan aja ya kamu...
Seriously, you're just making work for me...

471
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:53,242
Hah, I can't believe that you would make me look for you like this.

472
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:55,642
Ah!

473
00:31:55,742 --> 00:31:56,942
Ketemu!
Found you!

474
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:58,742
I found you!

475
00:32:01,142 --> 00:32:02,342
Jangan ke mana-mana lagi, ya?
Don't go anywhere else, okay?

476
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:03,742
Don't go anywhere now.

477
00:32:34,342 --> 00:32:38,142
言葉ひとつ香る 君のその髪が
With a single word, the scent of your hair...

478
00:32:38,142 --> 00:32:41,642
僕の心を踊らせたんです
Has made my heart dance.

479
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:44,442
靡くだけ 今は それだけで
Just swaying, right now, just that...

480
00:32:44,442 --> 00:32:46,742
この身 屈めますから
I will bow my body down.

481
00:32:47,442 --> 00:32:48,542
Hey hey hey

482
00:32:49,142 --> 00:32:51,742
Midnight光線 Darling
Midnight Ray Darling.

483
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:55,442
堪えきれぬ欲望に任せて
Giving in to uncontrollable desire.

484
00:32:55,442 --> 00:32:58,142
Midnight光線 Darling
Midnight Ray Darling.

485
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,442
僕に仕える気になったら
If you feel like serving me.

486
00:33:01,442 --> 00:33:04,742
Ah 願うは三度の絶頂を
Ah, I wish for three climaxes.

487
00:33:04,742 --> 00:33:07,042
胸の中で至る
Reaching it within my heart.

488
00:33:09,442 --> 00:33:13,442
今宵も僕らは繁栄のために
Tonight, for the sake of our prosperity...

489
00:33:13,442 --> 00:33:15,442
愛を放つ
We release our love.

490
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:33,142
抗いの呟きとは裏腹に
Contrary to your murmurs of resistance.

491
00:33:33,142 --> 00:33:36,742
身体は嬉しそうに動いたんです
Your body moved happily.

492
00:33:36,742 --> 00:33:39,442
この翼に輪を付けるかは
Whether to put a ring on these wings...

493
00:33:39,442 --> 00:33:41,442
僕ら次第ですから
Is up to us.

494
00:33:42,142 --> 00:33:44,442
真面目ですかな
Are you serious?

495
00:33:44,442 --> 00:33:46,142
淫らですかな
Or are you lewd?

496
00:33:46,142 --> 00:33:47,242
Hey hey hey

497
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:50,442
Midnight光線 Darling
Midnight Ray Darling.

498
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:54,142
愛と欲に純白を求めて
Seeking purity in love and lust.

499
00:33:54,142 --> 00:33:56,942
Midnight光線 Darling
Midnight Ray Darling.

500
00:33:56,942 --> 00:34:00,142
僕を拒む気になっても
Even if you feel like rejecting me.

501
00:34:00,142 --> 00:34:03,442
Ah 願うは三度の絶頂を
Ah, I wish for three climaxes.

502
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:05,842
胸の中で至る
Reaching it within my heart.

503
00:34:08,142 --> 00:34:11,442
零れる涙が飽和して
Overflowing tears saturate everything.

504
00:34:11,442 --> 00:34:13,742
僕は今に果てる
I will perish soon.

505
00:34:14,942 --> 00:34:18,142
その溢れた吐息の原因なんだって？
What is the cause of that overflowing sigh?

506
00:34:18,142 --> 00:34:20,142
一体どこからいったって？
Where on earth did it come from?

507
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,742
ドキドキなんだって？
You say your heart is pounding?

508
00:34:21,742 --> 00:34:24,742
よろめく恐怖が原因なんだって？
Is faltering fear the cause?

509
00:34:24,742 --> 00:34:26,942
それでも君ならいいんだって
Even so, if it's you, it's fine.

510
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:27,842
さらに
Furthermore...

511
00:34:50,942 --> 00:34:54,142
Ah 願うは三度の絶頂を
Ah, I wish for three climaxes.

512
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:56,442
胸の中で至る
Reaching it within my heart.

513
00:34:57,942 --> 00:35:00,442
今宵も僕らは繁栄の
Tonight, for the sake of our prosperity...

514
00:35:00,442 --> 00:35:01,942
ために
For that sake...

515
00:35:36,263 --> 00:35:38,563
ねえあたし知ってるよ
Hey, I know.

516
00:35:38,563 --> 00:35:41,963
君が一人知ってるの知ってるよ
You're all alone. I know it, I know.

517
00:35:41,963 --> 00:35:44,263
ビクンビクン震えてさ
Trembling and shaking,

518
00:35:44,263 --> 00:35:46,763
恋も留まりなんだわ
Love is at a stalemate too.

519
00:35:46,763 --> 00:35:49,263
正直に言っちゃいなよ
Just say it honestly.

520
00:35:49,263 --> 00:35:51,963
バレてるんだし言っちゃいなよ
It's obvious anyway, so just say it.

521
00:35:51,963 --> 00:35:53,263
効いてんの？
Is it working?

522
00:35:53,263 --> 00:35:55,563
グズグズ恥ずかしい
Whining is embarrassing,

523
00:35:55,563 --> 00:35:58,263
みんな隠しているだけ
Everyone is just hiding it.

524
00:35:58,263 --> 00:35:59,263
ムフッ
Muhu.

525
00:36:13,263 --> 00:36:15,963
うーわ！おねがい君が欲しいの

愛の才能で
With my talent for love.

528
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:22,563
泣いてくれなきゃ枯れてしまう
If you don't cry for me, I'll wither.

529
00:36:22,563 --> 00:36:24,963
濡れていたいねえいいでしょう？
I want to stay wet, hey, it's okay right?

530
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:27,263
ダメ取って飲み干したいん
It's no good, I want to drink it all up,

531
00:36:27,263 --> 00:36:28,763
だだだってば
I said D-D-D!

532
00:36:28,763 --> 00:36:30,563

535
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:05,263
ズクンズクン高まるよ
Throb, throb, it's rising.

536
00:37:05,263 --> 00:37:07,563
君を推すことは止めない
I won't stop pushing for you.

537

君はできる子知ってるよ
You're a capable kid. I know.

539
00:37:13,263 --> 00:37:15,763
辛い時は弱いくらいで丁度いい
When it's tough, being weak is just right.

540
00:37:15,763 --> 00:37:18,263
あたしそれでも好きだよ
I still like you even then.

541
00:37:27,263 --> 00:37:30,563
君が病める時も
Even when you are sick,

542
00:37:30,563 --> 00:37:33,963

That's right, it's not scary.

545
00:37:40,763 --> 00:37:44,963
あぁ
Aah...

546
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:47,563

Let me comfort you, Shake Shake.

548
00:37:49,963 --> 00:37:51,763

549
00:37:51,763 --> 00:37:54,263
泣いてくれなきゃ枯れてしまう

550
00:37:54,263 --> 00:37:56,563
濡れていたいねえいいでしょう？
I want to stay wet, hey, it's okay right?

551

ダメ取って飲み干したいん
It's no good, I want to drink it all up,

552
00:37:58,763 --> 00:38:00,263
だだだってば
I said D-D-D!

553
00:38:00,263 --> 00:38:01,763
うーわ！

555
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,263
Finally done!

556
00:38:54,563 --> 00:38:55,963
Wow.

557
00:38:56,263 --> 00:38:59,763
This way you won't be running away anymore~

558
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:03,263
Now be good and sit tight okay?

559
00:39:04,263 --> 00:39:07,263
Haa, you really made me work up a sweat.

560
00:39:07,563 --> 00:39:10,263
You make me look for you...

561
00:39:10,263 --> 00:39:13,263
Chase you down...

562
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:18,263
But I'm just glad that we are finally together again.

563
00:39:18,763 --> 00:39:21,963
Now we get to spend some time together...

564
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:24,763
Just the two of us.

565
00:39:27,263 --> 00:39:28,263
Ah.

566
00:39:28,263 --> 00:39:29,263
Hey.

567
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:30,563
Pay attention.

568
00:39:30,563 --> 00:39:31,763
Look at me.

569
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:32,963

こっちを見ろよ
Look over here...

571
00:39:35,763 --> 00:39:37,763
Hm. That's a good boy.

572
00:39:37,763 --> 00:39:40,763
I mean that's a good boy~

573
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:43,563
Alright.

574
00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:45,763
Now that I have your attention,

575
00:39:45,763 --> 00:39:49,763

Ollie akan perkenalkan satu-satu ya.
Ollie will introduce them one by one, okay.

581
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:08,304
Always think of Ollie Wide Rubber Mat.

582
00:40:08,404 --> 00:40:10,204
You always remember me.

583
00:40:10,204 --> 00:40:14,204
The theme is kinda... looks like a yandere, doesn't it?

584
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:16,904
But I'm not a yandere, I'm just your girlfriend.

585
00:40:16,904 --> 00:40:20,604
Yeah, it's wide, slightly large size, rubber mat,

586
00:40:20,604 --> 00:40:22,504
recommended for everyday use.

587
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:26,004
And the illustration is by Hanazawa Akira-sensei!

588
00:40:26,004 --> 00:40:28,104
ありがとうございます！
Thank you very much!

589
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:33,104
Okay then the next item will be... こちら！
Okay then the next item will be... This one!

590
00:40:34,004 --> 00:40:35,904
Wow, it's... Hello!

591
00:40:35,904 --> 00:40:38,804
Isn't it so cute? クッションだよ！
Isn't it so cute? It's a cushion!

592
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:41,504
Bantal, yes. So that when you're sleeping...
Pillow, yes. So that when you're sleeping...

593
00:40:41,504 --> 00:40:44,704
...you remember me. You dream of me.

594
00:40:44,704 --> 00:40:48,204
This... it looks so fluffy.

595
00:40:48,204 --> 00:40:51,004
So I guess better get it for a good night sleep.

596
00:40:51,404 --> 00:40:53,404
Right, and followed by... こちら！
Right, and followed by... This one!

597
00:40:54,304 --> 00:40:56,604
It's a Ring Necklace.

598
00:40:56,904 --> 00:41:00,404
Well it's a ring. If it doesn't fit your size,

599
00:41:00,404 --> 00:41:02,204
then you can just wear it as a necklace.

600
00:41:02,204 --> 00:41:03,804
Isn't that really cool?

601
00:41:03,804 --> 00:41:05,904
そう、これはね、指輪。
So, this is a ring.

602
00:41:05,904 --> 00:41:08,304
でも、サイズが合ってないなら、
But, if the size doesn't fit,

603
00:41:08,404 --> 00:41:12,204
ネックレスでも使える... ことができます。
you can use it... as a necklace too.

604
00:41:12,204 --> 00:41:14,204
Ah... It's so cute.

605
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:17,804
So make sure that when you go out, you wear this,

606
00:41:17,804 --> 00:41:20,704
so that whenever you go grocery shopping,

607
00:41:20,704 --> 00:41:24,004
no other girls out there will be hitting on you.

608
00:41:25,204 --> 00:41:27,804
Hai, and then we also have... こちら！
Yes, and then we also have... This one!

609
00:41:28,804 --> 00:41:30,204
It's a mug!

610
00:41:30,504 --> 00:41:33,504
Isn't it so cute? I really like the design.

611
00:41:33,604 --> 00:41:36,104
So not only when you're working, or gaming,

612
00:41:36,104 --> 00:41:39,104
or grocery shopping, or uh, sleeping,

613
00:41:39,104 --> 00:41:42,504
but even when you're drinking, you think of me.

614
00:41:43,304 --> 00:41:46,204
And of course, not forgetting... こちら！
And of course, not forgetting... This one!

615
00:41:47,604 --> 00:41:50,404

Thank you so much for coming to watch the 3D Birthday Live!

739
00:51:28,177 --> 00:51:29,127
How was it?

740
00:51:29,227 --> 00:51:30,827
Did you feel my love?

741
00:51:31,387 --> 00:51:32,727
Oh, look at that!

742
00:51:33,227 --> 00:51:35,627
It's the specially prepared bedroom.

743
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:37,127
Cute, isn't it?

744
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,827
It has a bed, a sofa, Udin...

745
00:51:41,127 --> 00:51:43,227
and, I don't know if you noticed but,

746
00:51:43,527 --> 00:51:47,327
there was a display photo of the people I cherish the most in there.

747
00:51:47,627 --> 00:51:48,827
Did you catch it?

748
00:51:49,327 --> 00:51:52,227
I think the neon stage was really cool too!

749
00:51:52,627 --> 00:51:55,427
You probably spotted a bunch of TVs sitting around.

750
00:51:56,027 --> 00:51:57,227
And, well,

751
00:51:57,527 --> 00:52:00,227
those are there to help me watch you from afar.

752
00:52:02,527 --> 00:52:04,127
Cool, right?

753
00:52:05,127 --> 00:52:07,027
Uh, but come to think of it,

754
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:10,527
I really did drag you around the stages, huh?

755
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:12,827
Um, how are you?

756
00:52:13,127 --> 00:52:14,327
Do you feel sick?

757
00:52:15,327 --> 00:52:17,027
Are you okay?

758
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:22,827
I'm a bit worried but I think it shouldn't affect you too much since I carried you while you were still sleeping.

759
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:24,227
But- huh? Wha-?

760
00:52:25,027 --> 00:52:26,827
N-No, nothing!

761
00:52:27,327 --> 00:52:29,027
I didn't say anything!

762
00:52:30,427 --> 00:52:32,227
Um, speaking of you,

763
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:35,227
you kept running and hiding away from me.

764
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:38,427
Naughty naughty. Tsk, tsk.

765
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:42,527
You always leave comments and like every post I make,

766
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:45,827
so I thought you'd like it if I came to visit.

767
00:52:46,027 --> 00:52:49,327
I didn't think it would actually surprise you that much.

768
00:52:50,027 --> 00:52:55,827
Um, I think maybe it was because you were too surprised when I suddenly appeared in front of you?

769
00:52:56,627 --> 00:52:58,127
Yeah... hmm.

770
00:52:58,627 --> 00:53:00,227
But, just so you know,

771
00:53:00,527 --> 00:53:03,527
I worked really hard, just for you.

772
00:53:05,127 --> 00:53:06,827
I practiced my singing,

773
00:53:07,027 --> 00:53:08,527
I sang a lot,

774
00:53:08,627 --> 00:53:11,227
and changed my outfit so many times,

775
00:53:11,527 --> 00:53:13,827
and I wonder if my feelings reached you.

776
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:18,027
It obviously did, right?

777
00:53:18,827 --> 00:53:20,427
Also, at the end,

778
00:53:20,627 --> 00:53:23,027
I finally managed to catch you.

779
00:53:23,427 --> 00:53:25,227
That's what you hoped for, right?

780
00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:27,527
I mean, 'cause you were running away from me,

781
00:53:27,627 --> 00:53:30,527
because you love me a lot.

782
00:53:31,027 --> 00:53:33,427
Obviously you were expecting it too.

783
00:53:34,027 --> 00:53:35,027
Right?

784
00:53:37,527 --> 00:53:39,227
...Hehe, period!

785
00:53:40,027 --> 00:53:42,827
Anyway, for those of you who are still watching,

786
00:53:42,927 --> 00:53:44,327
thank you by the way,

787
00:53:44,627 --> 00:53:46,327
I have an announcement.

788
00:53:46,827 --> 00:53:49,827
I'll be featured in SO87 song,

789
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:51,327
Love Me Back,

790
00:53:51,527 --> 00:53:53,227
with a music video!

791
00:53:53,627 --> 00:53:55,827
It's going to be so cool,

792
00:53:56,127 --> 00:53:57,827
so keep an eye out, okay?

793
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:01,027
Ah... it's just so exciting, isn't it?

794
00:54:02,627 --> 00:54:06,027
If you ever feel the need to feel my love again,

795
00:54:06,427 --> 00:54:11,327
then don't hesitate and please come back to watch the 3D Birthday Live again, okay?

796
00:54:12,227 --> 00:54:13,827
I'll always be here,

797
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,027
waiting for you.

798
