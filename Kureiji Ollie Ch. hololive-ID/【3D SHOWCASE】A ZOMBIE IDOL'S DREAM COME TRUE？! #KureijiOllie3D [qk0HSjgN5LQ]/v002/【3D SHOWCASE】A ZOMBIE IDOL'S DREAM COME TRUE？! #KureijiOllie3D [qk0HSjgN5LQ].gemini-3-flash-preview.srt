Waktunya bikin semua orang nangis.
Let's make everyone weep with joy!

37
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:39,833
Lullaby, lullaby, wonder hearts be collide,

38
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:43,933
who am I, in a place we've never been before?

39
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:48,333
I'm reaching out for the moon and stars beyond it.

40
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:52,533
Lullaby, lullaby, is it you I will find?

41
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:12,333
The moment that I hit you, you can't avoid the issue,

42
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:16,533
you're disconnected from the world you thought you were part of.

43
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:20,533
Hope you close your eyes and let go of your eyes have met no

44
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:24,433
body else decides the words you see in your heart.

45
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:28,133
Step up to the party's over here come one come all jump into the fire,

46
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:32,133
step up you are whatever you wanna be, you are free that's all we desire.

47
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:36,133
When you pass through the field of fantasy, there's a world with a rhythm for you and me.

48
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:40,433
Lullaby, lullaby, how can I find the love, lost in time there's an answer here in the stars for me.

49
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:44,233
All the way across the galaxy, go on forever.

50
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:48,433
Lullaby, lullaby, I will follow the signs 'cause I know when I reach the end it's you I'll see.

51
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:52,333
No we can't waste our time here it's now or never.

52
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:56,533
The valence force of nature, this visit of our future,

53
00:06:56,533 --> 00:07:00,633
sometimes I know it feels like fate is never on our side.

54
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:04,533
I'm standing inside the vortex, wonder how you here beside me,

55
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:08,533
you're all I need to lead me into a perfect sky.

56
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:12,333
Step up to the party's over here come one come all jump into the fire,

57
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:16,433
each of us could be as fierce and proud and power will never go tired.

58
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:20,333
Wind up the party's right here come one come all let's follow the North Star,

59
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:24,133
step in you are whatever you wanna be you are free it's what we all are.

60
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:28,333
Dance away the world and the love comes to life, drive into the future ready to get part.

61
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:32,433
Lullaby, lullaby, wonder hearts be collide, who am I, in a place we've never been before?

62
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:36,533
I'm reaching out for the moon and stars beyond it.

63
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:40,433
Lullaby, lullaby, is it you I will find, how I feel left behind some of them to a new closed door.

64
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:44,233
How I know who you are, how I wanna know it all.

65
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:51,533
Maybe it's a case I don't wanna wait, even if it's right or wrong, I don't wanna worry.

66
00:07:56,533 --> 00:08:00,633
If we didn't waste our time here it's now or never.

67
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,333
ZOM-BA-LA-LA!

68

えーと、そして、オリだけではなく、
Um, and, not just Ollie,

144
00:11:47,345 --> 00:11:49,445
もう一人が3Dができたよ！
another one became 3D!

145
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:54,045
えーと、うー！ うどーん！
Um, ugh! Udin!

146
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:56,925
Udin! Eh, gimana teman-teman? Hehe.
Udin! Hey, how is it, friends? Hehe.

147
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,545
Kece kan, ya?
Cool, right?

148
00:11:58,545 --> 00:12:00,645
ありがとう！
Thank you!

149
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:03,245
Aduh sudah datang. Wah!
Oh, they've arrived. Whoa!

150
00:12:03,245 --> 00:12:05,845
Keren, keren, keren. Banyak Udinnya, ya!
Cool, cool, cool. There are so many Udins!

151
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:07,445
Aren't they cute?

152
00:12:07,445 --> 00:12:09,645
Just dancing all over the place!

153
00:12:11,145 --> 00:12:13,545
Kalau gitu, Ollie kayaknya butuh satu Udin deh untuk nemenin Ollie.
In that case, I think Ollie needs one Udin to accompany her.

154
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:15,545
Ada nggak ya?
Is there one?

155
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:17,645
Udin? Udin-udin?
Udin? Udin, Udin?

156
00:12:17,645 --> 00:12:20,545
Oh, itu dia! Udin!
Oh, there he is! Udin!

157
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:22,345
Say hi to the camera!

158
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:23,045
Hai!
Hi!

159
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:25,545
Oh, good job, good job!

160
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,545
Muter-muter, muter-muter! Spin around!
Spin around, spin around! Spin around!

161
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:28,045
Ah!

162
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:30,545
Now show us your butt!

163
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:32,145
And that twerk!

164
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:33,545
Aha!

165
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:37,045
めっちゃいい！ Keren kan?
That's so good! Cool, right?

166
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:39,545
Udin high five! High five! High five!

167
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:40,845
Hui!

168
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:44,045
Pendek banget gila, ih!
You're so crazy short, jeez!

169
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:47,045
Anda pendek banget, jadi sulit kan?
You're so short, so it's difficult, right?

170
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:48,545
まぁいいでしょう。
Well, that's fine.

171
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:50,245
うん。やっぱ。
Yeah. I knew it.

172
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:51,545
Ya, kalau gitu, udah! Lu sana pergi! Hush!
Well then, that's enough! Go away! Hush!

173
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:55,245
Yah, じゃ、えーと、楽しかったね。
Well, um, that was fun.

00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:00,645
jadi jangan kalian ke mana-mana.

176
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:03,545
I still have so many things I want to show you guys,

177
00:13:03,545 --> 00:13:05,145

178
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:08,745
よし、えーと、それでは次の曲に行こうかな！
Alright, um, well then, let's go to the next song!

179
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:12,645
Let's go!

180
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:31,745
わっはー　ウィーアーゾンビ　ゾンビ
Wah-ha, we are zombie, zombie

181
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,145
Yeah　死にたい死にたい　死んでもゾンビ
Yeah, wanna die, wanna die, zombie even if dead

182
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:39,145
会いたい会いたい　書ききれないじゃない
Wanna meet, wanna meet, can't write it all

183
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:42,145
いつだって痛いの痛いの飛んでいけの
Always, "pain, pain, fly away"

184
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:45,145
なんでなんで　寂しさだけの　がちゃがちゃしてるんだ
Why, why? Just loneliness is clattering

185
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:48,345
わっはー　ウィーアーゾンビ　ゾンビ
Wah-ha, we are zombie, zombie

186
00:13:48,345 --> 00:13:51,345
わっはー　ウィーアーゾンビ　ゾンビ
Wah-ha, we are zombie, zombie

187
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:53,045
傷を持って　蜜を塗って
Bearing wounds, smeared with nectar

188
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:55,745
何度だって恋をする過程
Process of falling in love over and over

189
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,245
気付かせて　蜜を吸って
Make me notice, suck the nectar

190
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:02,145
何度だって恋がしたい
Want to fall in love over and over

191
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:05,045
腐っちゃってる　I love you, I love you
I'm rotting, I love you, I love you

192
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:08,245
腐りかけもいいわ
Half-rotten is fine too

193
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:11,245
腐っちゃえば　I love you, I love you
If I rot away, I love you, I love you

194
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:14,245
腐りたいけど違う
I want to rot, but it's different

195
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:16,845
わっはー　ウィーアーゾンビ　ゾンビ
Wah-ha, we are zombie, zombie

196
00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:19,445
ドキドキがもっとしたいな
I want to feel more heartbeats

197
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:22,145
わっはー　ウィーアーゾンビ　ゾンビ
Wah-ha, we are zombie, zombie

198
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:25,145
どうしても　すべて嫌なまま
No matter what, everything stays unpleasant

199
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:27,745
なっちゃったんで　しょうがないね
It happened, so it can't be helped

200
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:30,345
わっはー　ウィーアーゾンビ　ゾンビ
Wah-ha, we are zombie, zombie

201
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:33,245
わっはー　ウィーアーゾンビ　ゾンビ
Wah-ha, we are zombie, zombie

202
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:36,145
噛み応えも　足りない足りないよ
Not enough to chew on, not enough

203
00:14:36,145 --> 00:14:38,945
噛み付いて　ビューティフル無い無いよ
Bite down, there's no beauty

204
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,745
ディスコ吐いて　打っちゃう脱帽
Vomit disco, strike, hats off

205
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:44,745
日和見れば　でもそれじゃおかしくなって
Looking at the situation, but that'll get weird

206
00:14:44,745 --> 00:14:46,445
傷を持って　蜜を塗って
Bearing wounds, smeared with nectar

207
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:49,245
何度だって恋をする過程
Process of falling in love over and over

208
00:14:50,045 --> 00:14:51,645
気付かせて　蜜を吸って
Make me notice, suck the nectar

209
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:55,745
何度だって恋がしたい
Want to fall in love over and over

210
00:14:55,745 --> 00:15:00,045
ダメダメ
No, no

211
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:14,557
私になっちゃってるの アイラヴュー ヘイラヴュー 腐りかけもいいね
I'm becoming myself, I love you, hey love you, being half-rotten is nice too

212
00:15:15,357 --> 00:15:20,357
君もなっちゃえば アイラヴュー ヘイラヴュー 二人だけのシークレット
If you become one too, I love you, hey love you, a secret just for the two of us

213
00:15:20,507 --> 00:15:26,407
ゾンビになっちゃって アイラヴュー ヘイラヴュー 死なないからいいじゃん いいじゃん
Becoming a zombie, I love you, hey love you, it's fine since we don't die, right?

214
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:32,407
ゾンビになっちゃえば アイラヴュー ヘイラヴュー 正気じゃないじゃないじゃないな
If you become a zombie, I love you, hey love you, it's not sane, not sane, not sane

215
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:38,207
We're ゾンビ ゾンビ 惹きがもうすごいの
We're zombies, zombies, the attraction is already amazing

216
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:43,757
We're ゾンビ ゾンビ 狂ってもしょーがないね
We're zombies, zombies, it can't be helped even if we go crazy

217
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:46,407
狂ってもしょーがないね
It can't be helped even if we go crazy

218
00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:49,457
ジンガイ ジンガイ 死んじゃうよ
Non-human, non-human, you'll die

219
00:15:49,507 --> 00:15:52,207
段々ノリに 会いたい 会いたい 抱きゃいいじゃん
Gradually getting into the rhythm, I want to see you, I want to see you, just hug me

220
00:15:52,257 --> 00:15:55,157
いっせーのーで いっせーのーで
On the count of three, on the count of three

221
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:58,057
飛んじゃいけの なんで なんで
Why can't I just fly off? Why, why?

222
00:15:58,107 --> 00:16:00,057
寂しさだけ残っちゃってんだ
Only loneliness is left behind

Capek banget, teman-teman.
I'm so tired, friends.

225
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:14,357
Akhirnya, Zombie...
Finally, Zombie...

226
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,757
Giga-san-ssu Zombie... (remix)
Giga-san's Zombie remix...

227
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:18,457
ゾンビも歌った。
I sang Zombie too.

228
00:16:19,557 --> 00:16:21,357
もう、いっぱい練習しましたよ。
I practiced a lot.

229
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:23,957
I practiced a lot, you guys would never know.

230
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:26,457
Ollie latihan banyak-banyak banget.
Ollie practiced a whole lot.

231
00:16:26,557 --> 00:16:27,457
Capek.

232
00:16:27,557 --> 00:16:28,457
Capek.
Tired.

233
00:16:28,557 --> 00:16:31,057
ゴレフ。
*collapses*

234
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,957
大丈夫です。
I'm fine.

235
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:34,457
I'm okay.

236
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:36,457
お腹空いたな。
I'm hungry.

237
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:38,457
次、Ollieのおうちに行こうか。
Next, shall we go to Ollie's house?

238
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:40,457
Ke rumah Ollie aja kali ya?
Maybe we should just go to Ollie's house?

239
00:16:40,557 --> 00:16:42,957
Teman-teman, ayo ikut Ollie.
Everyone, come with Ollie.

240
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:44,457
Kita ke rumah Ollie, yuk.
Let's go to Ollie's house.

241
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:46,457
Everyone, we're going to my house.

242
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:47,957
ラーメン食べたい。
I want to eat ramen.

243
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:50,057
Let's go!

244
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:06,457
まーがん！ラーメン！ラーメン！ラーメン！
Ramen! Ramen! Ramen! Ramen!

245
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:08,457
着いた、着いた！
We're here, we're here!

246
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:10,957
We're finally here at the ramen shop...

247
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:12,957
No, it's not the ramen shop.

248
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:14,457
It's my house!

249
00:17:14,557 --> 00:17:16,457
Sini itu rumahnya Ollie, ya.
This is Ollie's house, okay.

250
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:18,457
ラーメン屋じゃないよ。
It's not a ramen shop.

251
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:20,957
これはOllieのうちだよ、うち。
This is Ollie's house, my home.

252
00:17:21,057 --> 00:17:21,957
うち。
Home.

253
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:24,457
えっとね、ここはTVがあるはず。
Well, there should be a TV here.

254
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:26,457
Di sini itu ada TV.
There used to be a TV here.

255
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:28,457
There used to be a television here.

256
00:17:28,557 --> 00:17:30,457
And over here used to be a sofa.

257
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:32,457
But I don't see it anymore.

258
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:34,457
It's a little bit sad and frustrating.

259
00:17:34,557 --> 00:17:35,957
Agak kesel ya teman-teman.
It's quite annoying, friends.

260
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:37,957
Tapi ya sudahlah.
But whatever.

261
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,957
Ollie udah lapar, jadi kita nggak usah pikirin lagi kali ya.
Ollie is hungry, so let's not think about it anymore.

262
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:44,457
腹がもうペコペコだから、まいっか！
My stomach is growling, so whatever!

263
00:17:44,557 --> 00:17:45,957
食べようか、ラーメン。
Shall we eat ramen?

264
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:48,457
Let's just go and make some ramen.

265
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:49,457
行こう！
Let's go!

266
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:51,457
The kitchen should be this way.

267
00:17:51,557 --> 00:17:52,957
Ini kok nggak ada orang ya?
Wait, there's no one here?

268
00:17:53,057 --> 00:17:54,457
Self-service kali ya?
Maybe it's self-service?

269
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:55,957
セルフサービスかな？
Self-service, maybe?

270
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:58,457
じゃ、着いた！
Well, we're here!

271
00:17:58,557 --> 00:17:59,957
This is the kitchen.

272
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:01,957
Ini adalah dapur.
This is the kitchen.

273
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:03,957
Kalau gitu, Ollie cari dulu...
In that case, Ollie will look for...

274
00:18:04,057 --> 00:18:05,957
あ、どこだ？湯切り、湯切り？
Ah, where is it? The strainer, the strainer?

275
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:09,457
ガサガサ、ガサガサ。
*rustling, rustling*

276
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:10,457
見つけた！
Found it!

277
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:13,457
ヘヘ。Ini ya teman-teman, Ollie udah belajar.
Hehe. This is it friends, Ollie has learned this.

278
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:15,457
湯切りだよね？
It's called yukiri, right?

279
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:16,957
そして動く...
And then you move it...

280
00:18:17,057 --> 00:18:18,457
だから湯切り！
So it's yukiri!

281
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,457
Ini namanya yukiri.
This is called yukiri.

282
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,957
から... 動きに。
From... the movement.

283
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:23,957
Kita masak aja.
Let's just cook.

284
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:26,457
So hungry!

285
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:27,957
な... よいしょ。
Na... there we go.

286
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:30,457
緩やかに。
Slowly.

287
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:32,457
Just slowly.

288
00:18:32,557 --> 00:18:33,957
There we go.

289
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:34,957
And with that...

290
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:36,957
Let me just put this down.

291
00:18:37,057 --> 00:18:38,957
ガサガサ。
*rustle rustle*

292
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:41,457
And our ramen is done!

293
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:42,957
完成、完成！
Finished, finished!

294
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:44,957
Selesai juga.
It's finally done.

295
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,457
美味しそう！

00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:11,281
Eh, Ollie nanti kamu jangan lihat Twitter ya.
Eh, Ollie, don't check Twitter later, okay?

457
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:13,281
Ada apa? Ada apa dengan Twitter?
What's up? What's wrong with Twitter?

458
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:15,281
Jangan lihat Twitter nggak apa-apa.
Just don't check Twitter, it's okay.

459
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:17,281
Jangan-jangan... jangan lihat Twitter kita berdua, jangan.
Don't... don't look at our Twitters, don't.

460
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:20,281
Oh, oh... begitu kah? Oh, oh, baiklah.
Oh, oh... is that so? Oh, oh, alright.

00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:24,081
Oke, mumpung nih kalian di sini. While you guys are still here.
Okay, since you guys are here. While you guys are still here.

462
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:27,581
Enaknya kita main nggak sih? I think it's fun if we play.
Wouldn't it be fun if we played something? I think it's fun if we play.

463
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:30,281
Boleh! Ayo, gas! Mari!
Sure! Let's go! Come on!

464
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:36,281
Tapi jangan yang susah-susah ya, Ollie takut, ID satu tidak boleh berkata kasar.
But nothing too hard, Ollie's scared, Gen 1 shouldn't use harsh words.

465
00:27:37,081 --> 00:27:41,081
Ya, kalau gitu, mari kita main tebak-tebakan... let's play some charades.
In that case, let's play a guessing game... let's play some charades.

466
00:27:41,581 --> 00:27:45,581
Jadi rulesnya simpel ya. Ollie akan memperagakan sesuatu, kalian harus menebak.
The rules are simple. Ollie will act something out and you have to guess.

467
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,581
Apabila benar, kalian boleh ngerikues apa pun dari Ollie.
If you get it right, you can request anything from Ollie.

468
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:55,081
Oke, apa pun? Apa pun? Eh, aku mikirin apa nih? Apa pun?
Okay, anything? Anything? Eh, what should I think of? Anything?

469
00:27:55,581 --> 00:27:59,581

Are you sure you can do it, Yopi? Me, friends...

470
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:05,581
Apa pun! Ini, ini itu kan... gara-gara Risu-senpai di chat pada nulis 'malas' semua 'malas'.
Anything! This is... because of Risu-senpai, everyone in chat is writing 'lazy'.

471
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:08,281
Ya udah, jangan malas-malas lagi kalau gitu! Ayo semangat!
Well then, don't be lazy anymore! Let's get pumped!

472
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:10,581
Nggak boleh! Nggak boleh malas!
No way! You can't be lazy!

473
00:28:11,081 --> 00:28:16,581
Kalau gitu, kita langsung masuk ke pertanyaan per... pertama kalian.
In that case, let's go straight to your very first question.

Kalau gitu, apakah ada... oh tunggu sebentar.
In that case, is there... oh wait a second.

480
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:44,581
Ini mumpung nih, mumpung banget. Kayaknya kalau Ollie berpose pakai sesuatu yang keren, keren juga nggak sih?
Since we're here, it's a great opportunity. Wouldn't it be cool if Ollie posed with something cool?

481
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:47,581
Boleh! Tunggu, Ollie ambil pistol dulu ya.
Sure! Wait, Ollie will get the gun first.

482
00:28:48,081 --> 00:28:52,581
Oke! Ah, buat melawan ini tadi, apa... dorobou.
Okay! Ah, to fight this earlier, what was it... the thief.

483
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:56,581
Dia, si 'Doro-Zombie'.
Her, the 'Thief-Zombie'.

484
00:28:57,081 --> 00:29:00,081
Keren kan? Berpose pakai ini kali ya.
Cool, right? I'll pose with this.

485
00:29:00,581 --> 00:29:04,081
Ets! Boleh, boleh. Kalau gitu, Yopi ada rikues nggak?
Hey! Sure, sure. In that case, Yopi do you have a request?

486
00:29:04,581 --> 00:29:10,081
Ah, ini... kamu jalan ke belakang terus kayak ke samping gitu lho. Ngerti nggak?
Ah, this... you walk to the back and then go to the side like that. Get it?

487
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:15,081
Kamu jalan ke belakang terus langsung kayak balikin badan ke sini gitu lho. Kayak pose habis nembak gitu lho.
You walk to the back and then immediately turn around to here. Like a post-shooting pose.

488
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:22,581
Kalau gitu... na na na! Satu, dua, tiga... PLING! Ck-ya!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Hey! Wow, that's cool.

491
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:37,581
Kalau gitu berikutnya Ollie juga bakal pakai ini kali ya.
In that case, next Ollie will probably use this too.

492
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:47,081
Oke, kalau gitu kita langsung ke... pertanyaan kedua. Eto... sato!

Cute like this and I'm being punished?

746
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:03,617
Masa sih?
Really?

747
00:40:03,617 --> 00:40:05,617
Nah ya udah, kalau gitu...
Well then, in that case...

748
00:40:05,617 --> 00:40:09,117
...itu pose paling tsundere kalau gitu.
...give us your best tsundere pose.

749
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:11,117
Oke, oke.
Okay, okay.

750
00:40:12,617 --> 00:40:13,617
Ha!

751
00:40:13,617 --> 00:40:15,617
Bukannya tsundere bawa pedang gitu ya?
Isn't a tsundere supposed to carry a sword?

752
00:40:15,617 --> 00:40:17,617
Serem ya.
It's scary.

753
00:40:17,617 --> 00:40:20,317
Bukannya aku suka sama kamu ya!
It's not like I like you or anything!

754
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:24,117
別に君のこととか好きじゃないんだから、
勘違いしないよね！
It's not like I like you,
so don't get the wrong idea!

755
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:26,617
ぶっ飛ばすよ！
I'll blow you away!

756
00:40:26,617 --> 00:40:30,117
Sangat-sangat mendalami peran sekali.
Truly getting into the role.

757
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:36,617
Iya suka-suka mau, mau, Onegaishimasu, Kakak.
Yes, whatever you want, please, Sister.

758
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:43,117
Ya udah kalau gitu tadi serem makasih ya udah datang.
Alright then, that was scary, thanks for coming.

759
00:40:43,117 --> 00:40:46,117
Ini ya makasih juga udah ngundang kita.
Thanks for inviting us too.

760
00:40:46,117 --> 00:40:49,117
Makasih, makasih. Pedangnya disimpan lagi, Mas.
Thank you, thank you. Put the sword away, Sir.

761
00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:50,617
Iya, iya. Nanti kusita.
Yes, yes. I'll confiscate it later.

762
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:52,117
Bye bye. Bye bye, Senpai!

763
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,117
Ayo, ayo, ayo ambil ramennya.
Come on, let's take the ramen.

764
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:57,117
Woi, woi, ramennya jangan diambil!
Hey, hey, don't take the ramen!

765
00:40:57,117 --> 00:41:00,117
Nah barusan adalah Gen 3.
Well, that was Gen 3.

766
00:41:00,117 --> 00:41:02,117
Tunggu, ini Ollie tancep lagi ke kepala Ollie kali ya.
Wait, let me stick this back in my head.

767
00:41:02,117 --> 00:41:03,617
Chotto matte ne.
Wait a second.

768
00:41:05,117 --> 00:41:06,617
Ittai!
Ouch!

769
00:41:07,617 --> 00:41:10,117
Ketancep lagi.
It's stuck again.

770
00:41:11,117 --> 00:41:14,617
Mou... Dokka Kenka?
Man... A toxic fight?

771
00:41:14,617 --> 00:41:21,117
Ya kalau gitu kan tadi udah ada Gen 1, udah ada Gen 3...
Well, since we had Gen 1 and Gen 3...

772
00:41:21,117 --> 00:41:25,117
...berarti seharusnya ada satu Gen lagi nggak sih?
...there should be one more Gen, right?

773
00:41:25,117 --> 00:41:27,617
Moshi-moshi.
Hello?

774
00:41:28,117 --> 00:41:33,117
Halo, halo, halo, di mana Ollie?
Hello, hello, hello, where is Ollie?

775
00:41:33,117 --> 00:41:34,617
Kok serem ya?
This is scary.

776
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,117
Siapa ya? Halo, halo.
Who is it? Hello, hello.

777
00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:43,117
Kayaknya aku tadi mendengar ada seseorang yang mencurigakan.
I think I heard someone suspicious.

778
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:46,117
Enggak kok, apa sih?
No, what do you mean?

779
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:54,117
Ayo buka! Hoi! Ayo, ayo, ayo!
Open up! Hey! Come on, come on, come on!

780
00:41:54,117 --> 00:41:57,117
Hehe, horror dayo.
Hehe, it's horror.

781
00:41:57,117 --> 00:42:01,117
Siapa kak ini? Horololive? Silakan perkenalkan diri.
Who is this? Horololive? Please introduce yourself.

782
00:42:02,617 --> 00:42:04,117
Hai! Aku adalah...
Hi! I am...

783
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:09,117
I'm Pavolia Reine dari Holo ID Generasi 2!
I'm Pavolia Reine from Holo ID Generation 2!

784
00:42:11,617 --> 00:42:14,117
Dan... Halo,
And... Hello,

785
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:17,117
aku Anya Melfissa dari Holo ID Generasi 2.
I'm Anya Melfissa from Holo ID Generation 2.

786
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,117
I don't talk like that.

787
00:42:19,117 --> 00:42:22,117
Itu Anya Melfissa plus Shinto ya?
Is that Anya Melfissa plus Shinto?

788
00:42:23,117 --> 00:42:24,617
Mirip gitu.
It's similar.

789
00:42:25,117 --> 00:42:26,617
Oh my god.

790
00:42:26,617 --> 00:42:28,117
Apaan itu banget?
What was that?

791
00:42:28,117 --> 00:42:30,117
Lucu kan? Gemoy, gemoy!
Cute, right? So cute!

792
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:34,117
Kalau kalian pengen pose lagi, kalian harus main game.
If you want to pose again, you have to play a game.

793
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:36,117
Oke, baiklah. Game apa tuh?
Okay, fine. What game?

794
00:42:36,617 --> 00:42:40,117
Kita bakal main Charades.
We're going to play Charades.

795
00:42:41,117 --> 00:42:43,117
Oke, kalau kalian bener baru boleh pose lagi.
Okay, if you're right, then you can pose again.

796
00:42:43,117 --> 00:42:46,117
Aku sih kayaknya jago banget nggak sih main ini?
I think I'm really good at this game, right?

797
00:42:46,117 --> 00:42:49,117
Aku udah kepikiran mau request Ollie ngapain.
I already have an idea of what to ask Ollie to do.

798
00:42:49,117 --> 00:42:50,617
Masa?
Really?

799
00:42:50,617 --> 00:42:53,117
Ya udah kalau gitu kita langsung masuk aja nih ya.
Alright then, let's get right into it.

800
00:42:53,117 --> 00:42:55,117
Pertanyaan pertama, stop!
First question, stop!

801
00:43:00,117 --> 00:43:01,617
Oi!
Hey!

802
00:43:01,617 --> 00:43:03,117
Zombie.

803
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:06,117
Theme: Zombie

804
00:43:03,617 --> 00:43:06,117
Zombie! Let's go!

805
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:12,117
Kalau gitu... aduh, biar seru nih, kan dari tadi Ollie sendiri kan ya.
In that case... to make it more exciting, since Ollie's been alone this whole time.

806
00:43:13,117 --> 00:43:16,117
Ollie panggil teman dulu kali ya biar bisa pose bareng.
Let me call a friend so we can pose together.

807
00:43:16,117 --> 00:43:19,117
Eh siapa tuh? Siapa tuh?
Oh, who's that?

808
00:43:19,117 --> 00:43:21,117
Woi! Udin!
Hey! Udin!

809
00:43:21,117 --> 00:43:24,117
Aku jadi ngeri gitu diteriakin.
I got scared being shouted at.

810
00:43:24,117 --> 00:43:27,617
Jadi nanti Ollie bakal pose sama Udin. Gemoy banget!
So Ollie will pose with Udin. So cute!

811
00:43:30,117 --> 00:43:33,117
Udin muter! Muter!
Udin, spin! Spin!

812
00:43:33,617 --> 00:43:36,617
Wah goyang ngebor hanya untuk tante.
Wow, doing the 'drilling' dance just for the auntie.

813
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:40,117
Aduh makasih banget ngebor banget nggak sih?
Oh, thank you so much, that's really 'drilling' isn't it?

814
00:43:41,117 --> 00:43:44,117
Kalau gitu ada request apa nih Reine?
In that case, what's your request, Reine?

815
00:43:44,117 --> 00:43:48,117
Aku mau kamu kayak... kamu tahu nggak sih kalau orang tuh dance off gitu?
I want you to... you know when people have a dance-off?

816
00:43:48,617 --> 00:43:52,117
Aku mau kamu sama Udin kayak twerk-off gitu loh.
I want you and Udin to have a twerk-off.

817
00:43:52,617 --> 00:43:53,617
Demi apa?
Are you serious?

818
00:43:54,117 --> 00:43:55,617
Udin lu bisa?
Udin, can you do it?

819
00:43:55,617 --> 00:43:58,117
Ya udah, ditantang tuh. Akan kita coba.
Alright, challenge accepted. We'll try it.

820
00:43:59,117 --> 00:44:01,617
Ayo kita lihat siapa yang paling jago.
Let's see who's the best.

821
00:44:01,617 --> 00:44:03,117
Ya pasti saya dong.
Obviously it's me.

822
00:44:06,117 --> 00:44:10,117
Ini pantat aku nggak kelihatan, agak sedih ya.
My butt isn't showing, that's a bit sad.

823
00:44:10,117 --> 00:44:13,617
Nggak apa-apa kayak dikipasin gitu.
It's okay, it's like being fanned.

824
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,617
Dikipasin pakai rok ya.
Fanned with the skirt.

825
00:44:15,617 --> 00:44:18,117
Iya betul banget. Wah seru banget.
Yeah, exactly. Wow, so fun.

826
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:24,117
Sepertinya dejavu gitu deh.
Feels like déjà vu.

827
00:44:25,617 --> 00:44:30,117
Mohon maaf sebelumnya saya tidak bermaksud.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

828
00:44:30,617 --> 00:44:33,117
Tasukaru. Terima kasih.
Helpful. Thank you.

829
00:44:33,117 --> 00:44:35,617
Oke yuk kita langsung aja kali ya.
Okay, let's just get straight to it.

830
00:44:35,617 --> 00:44:38,617
Ini yang terakhir kali ya satu buat Anya gitu.
This is the last one, one for Anya.

831
00:44:38,617 --> 00:44:40,117
Anya semangat.
Anya, good luck.

832
00:44:40,617 --> 00:44:42,117
Oke siap.
Okay, ready.

833
00:44:42,117 --> 00:44:44,117
Oke kalau gitu... satu!
Okay then... one!

834
00:44:44,117 --> 00:44:46,117
Duh ini susah ya.
Oh, this is hard.

835
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:48,117
Udin bantu gua, Din.
Udin, help me.

836
00:44:48,117 --> 00:44:50,117
Buat aku sesimpel itu ya.
Make it simple for me.

837
00:44:50,117 --> 00:44:52,617
Kan kamu pro-nya, bisalah.
You're the pro, you can do it.

838
00:44:52,617 --> 00:44:54,117
Gitu.
Like that.

839
00:44:54,117 --> 00:44:56,117
Ngapain? Menyihir?
Doing what? Casting a spell?

840
00:44:56,617 --> 00:44:59,117
Oh oke, Puppet Master gitu.
Oh okay, like a Puppet Master.

841
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:14,129
Theme: Sorcerer 魔法使い
Theme: Sorcerer

842
00:45:01,454 --> 00:45:02,229
Sorcerer!

843
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:03,629
Keren banget ya!
So cool, right!

844
00:45:06,229 --> 00:45:08,629
Keren, keren, keren, Game Master. Game Master.
Cool, cool, cool, Game Master. Game Master.

845
00:45:08,729 --> 00:45:10,029
Lucu banget!
So cute!

846
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:13,629
Iya, kalau gitu ada request apa ya?
Yes, so what requests are there?

847
00:45:14,429 --> 00:45:16,529
Oh, iya. Kamu sama Udin.
Oh, right. You and Udin.

848
00:45:16,929 --> 00:45:19,529
Mumpung Udin ada di sini...
Since Udin is here...

849
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:22,429
Eh, aku pengen lihat kalian panco bisa nggak sih?
Eh, I want to see you guys arm wrestle, can you?

850
00:45:23,129 --> 00:45:24,529
Bisa nggak ya? Din.
Can we? Udin.

851
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:27,829
Kita pengen lihat kalian panco, adu panco gitu bisa nggak ya?
We want to see you arm wrestle, like an arm wrestling match, is it possible?

852
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:32,529
Kita gandengan aja deh.
Let's just hold hands.

853
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:34,429
Panco sepertinya... gandengan aja nggak apa-apa.
Arm wrestling seems... holding hands is fine.

854
00:45:34,529 --> 00:45:36,229
Tete.
Sister.

855
00:45:36,229 --> 00:45:37,529
Lu pendek sih!
You're short!

856
00:45:37,629 --> 00:45:38,929
Ih, kayak gini.
Eh, like this.

857
00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:41,329
Ah, Tete!
Ah, Sister!

858
00:45:42,229 --> 00:45:44,929
Tete tapi aku nggak punya...
Sister, but I don't have...

859
00:45:45,129 --> 00:45:46,529
Tete...
Sister...

860
00:45:46,629 --> 00:45:48,629
Bukan aku yang bilang!
I wasn't the one who said it!

861
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:51,729
Aku sadar diri kok, tidak apa-apa.
I'm self-aware, it's okay.

862
00:45:52,129 --> 00:45:55,829
Kalau begitu, makasih, aduh Holoro-ku tersayang!
In that case, thank you, oh my dear Holoro!

863
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,629
Selamat ya, Cece!
Congratulations, Cece!

864
00:45:59,029 --> 00:46:02,229
Congratulations for the 3D!

865
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:04,029
Tonton sampai menang, Ton.
Watch until victory.

866
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:06,129
Jangan lupa kalian nge-tweet pakai hashtag ini dong!
Don't forget to tweet using this hashtag!

867
00:46:06,229 --> 00:46:08,629
Udah, udah pasti dong.
Already, definitely.

868
00:46:08,729 --> 00:46:11,929
Kapan-kapan mampir tonton sampai habis susu stroberi yang di fountain kamu boleh nggak?
Can I drop by sometime and drink all the strawberry milk in your fountain?

869
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:13,329
Oke, sip!
Okay, deal!

870
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:15,629
Oke banget, oke banget.
Very okay, very okay.

871
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:17,429
Yes, thank you banget.
Yes, thank you so much.

872
00:46:17,729 --> 00:46:19,429
Kalau gitu, bye-bye!
If so, bye-bye!

873
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:21,429
Bye-bye! Semangat!
Bye-bye! Good luck!

874
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,429
Thank you!

875
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:28,129
Wah, barusan adalah teman-teman Ollie dari Holo ID.
Wow, those were Ollie's friends from Holo ID.

876
00:46:28,229 --> 00:46:29,729
Iya nggak, Din? Seru nggak?
Right, Udin? Was it fun?

877
00:46:30,129 --> 00:46:32,129
Barusan dadakan.
That was sudden.

878
00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:34,129
Heeh, emang.
Yeah, indeed.

879
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:38,329
Gitu lah, ada apa tuh di chat?
That's how it is, what's in the chat?

880
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:41,029
Kalian cepat banget, Ollie cuma bisa baca 'tasukaru' aja.
You guys are so fast, Ollie can only read 'tasukaru'.

881
00:46:41,129 --> 00:46:42,629
Kalau gitu, ehm...
In that case, um...

882
00:46:42,729 --> 00:46:46,929
Sebenarnya masih ada banyak nih, teman-teman. We still have a few more things that we want to show you.
Actually, there's still a lot more, friends. We still have a few more things that we want to show you.

883
00:46:47,129 --> 00:46:49,129
So don't go anywhere, jangan go ke mana-mana.
So don't go anywhere, don't go anywhere.

884
00:46:49,229 --> 00:46:53,429
え、この後はまだいっぱい、いっぱいあるよ！
Eh, there's still plenty more after this!

885
00:46:53,529 --> 00:46:56,229
だからね、えーっと、ついて来いよ！
So, um, follow me!

886
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:58,629
Let's go!

887
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:15,629
Yah, kalau kalian pengen sikat miring sudah pasti awalnya harus kita sanggupin. Iya nggak?
Well, if you want to do the 'sikat miring', you definitely have to be able to do it first. Right?

888
00:47:16,129 --> 00:47:18,629
Kalau kalian nggak sanggup, ya sanggupin!
If you can't, then make yourself able!

889
00:47:19,129 --> 00:47:22,629
Kalau niat kalian sudah bulat. Kalau gitu niatnya itu kita lempar ke atas.
If your intention is firm. Then let's throw that intention upwards.

890
00:47:24,129 --> 00:47:25,629
DONG! Sundul sayang.
BOOM! Header, dear.

Ohayou konbanwa kami serukan kepada dunia

Ku tak dapat pernah memutuskan
I could never decide

Kata-kata perih membuatku kehilangan arah

959
00:52:32,141 --> 00:52:37,341
Seakan seperti keluarga bersatu dalam perbedaan
Like a family, united in diversity

Dapatkah harmoni tercipta?

Bergandengan tangan berjuang raih mimpi bersama
Holding hands, struggling to achieve dreams together

Semua bersorak dengan suara gempita
Everyone cheers with a thunderous voice

Menyebarkan kebahagiaan di mana pun itu
Spreading happiness wherever it is

Panggung yang lebih besar kini menunggu
A bigger stage is now waiting

Hilanglah semua rasa bimbang di hati
All feelings of doubt in the heart are gone
