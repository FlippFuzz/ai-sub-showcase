279
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:41,081

00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:55,081
You love the live? Oh thank you, thank you.

284
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:59,081
Oh my hat's cut off a little bit. Let me fix that. There we go.

285
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:04,081
Yeah, sounds good? Okay, sweet.

286
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:08,581
Oh, I was going to add something else. So, yes, I'm in Japan right now.

287
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:12,581
I wanted to go over the merch again because Small Ame did it like super, super fast.

288
00:27:12,581 --> 00:27:15,081
Um, so let's go over the merch again.

289
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:18,081
Really quick, let's see, the slideshow. Oops.

290
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:22,081
Don't mind that. Don't mind, don't mind.

291
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:25,081
All right, let me restart it. Will this restart it?

292
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:30,081
All right, let me bring up the image manually so that we can take a look.

293
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:35,081
Ah, thank you guys. The static, yeah, was it getting crunchy at all during the...

294
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:40,081
it's, uh, it's getting a little crunchy sometimes. I don't know why it does that.

295
00:27:40,081 --> 00:27:44,081
Ah, but it goes away after a little bit.

296
00:27:44,781 --> 00:27:48,081
All right, so the first item in the merch,

297
00:27:48,081 --> 00:27:51,081
um, yeah, a dakimakura.

298
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:56,081
Excuse me. Dakimakura drawn by Nabi-mama.

299
00:27:56,081 --> 00:28:00,081
Let's zoom in on this. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Damn! Whoa!

300
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:09,581
So this is, uh, actually a cover. You do have to get the pillow separately,

301
00:28:09,581 --> 00:28:13,581
but you can get the cover if any of you guys are interested in that.

302
00:28:15,581 --> 00:28:20,081
Um, and then after that, I think these items should be up for sale in one minute

303
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:23,081
if you want. If you want, you don't have to of course.

304
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:28,081
But then also there's this, uh, this is actually a magnet,

305
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:33,081
and this is like something to put on your fridge

306
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:37,081
and write down the tasks that you've got to do for the day, right?

307
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:42,081
The Ame-toes, yeah, they're covered unfortunately for you sick ones out there.

308
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:47,081
Um, yeah, this one's a task manager. It's a magnet

309
00:28:47,081 --> 00:28:51,081
and it comes with a Small Ame pen. Look at her.

310
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:54,081
Um, so yeah, this is pretty useful, you know, help you finish your tasks.

311
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:58,081
And there's also these, um, magnets, which look at them, so cute.

312
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:02,081
These are magnets to go along with the set.

313
00:29:02,081 --> 00:29:05,081
You can see the artist here. Haru-ya, Haru-ya.

314
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:11,081
So cute.

315
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:17,081
And then the my favorite item personally is this Bubba lamp.

316
00:29:17,081 --> 00:29:22,081
Look at the Bubba lamp! It lights up and it's also a little squishy.

317
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:27,081
Squishy Bubba lamp. Um, please do not dent his face, okay?

318
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:32,081
Yeah, this one's really cool. All the items are available for purchase separately.

319
00:29:32,081 --> 00:29:37,081
Um, so you can get this just by itself if you don't want the dakimakura

320
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:42,081
or any of the other stuff. That's totally fine.

321
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:45,081
I'm pretty sure they're available for purchase separately.

322
00:29:45,081 --> 00:29:48,081
Um, manager confirm?

323
00:29:48,081 --> 00:29:53,081
Yeah, gotta take good care of the lamp. That's right. Head pats only.

324
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:55,081
Don't punch it, okay?

325
00:29:55,081 --> 00:29:58,081
All right, the merch is live. Yeah, all the links are in the description.

326
00:29:58,081 --> 00:30:00,081
It'll be live for one month, so if you guys need to save a little bit...

327
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:17,581
Watson Amelia Official Pillow Cover

328
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:19,581
Watson's Task Manager

329
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:56,081
Magnet Sticker Sheet

330
00:29:15,081 --> 00:29:17,581
Squishy Bubba Night Lamp

331
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,443
a little tiny dakimakura card...

332
00:30:01,443 --> 00:30:02,918
...which uh has my signature back there...

333
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:04,343
...and a special message...

334
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:06,743
...which is uh I don't want to spoil it for you guys...

335
00:30:06,743 --> 00:30:10,043
...so you gotta wait until you get it in one year.

336
00:30:10,043 --> 00:30:13,593
Wait what? Hopefully it won't take that long.

337
00:30:13,593 --> 00:30:16,243
Yeah, sorry about the static. I don't know why it does that.

338
00:30:16,243 --> 00:30:17,743
It does that every now and then.

339
00:30:17,743 --> 00:30:19,543
I hope it's not that bad.

340
00:30:19,543 --> 00:30:20,743
I don't think it's part of the BGM,

341
00:30:20,743 --> 00:30:22,593
I think it's just the audio setup that I'm using.

342
00:30:22,593 --> 00:30:25,093
So sorry, sorry, sorry!

343
00:30:25,093 --> 00:30:27,243
Um so yeah, that's uh pretty much everything.

344
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:29,893
I'm gonna put this slideshow back up here.

345
00:30:29,893 --> 00:30:32,743
Birthday Celebration!

346
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:35,543
And yeah, oh what'd you guys think of the...

347
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:37,943
What'd you guys think of... Here I'm gonna bring it,

348
00:30:37,943 --> 00:30:40,643
I'm gonna bring it up here.

349
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:43,093
Okay let's switch to here actually.

350
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:45,643
Let's do this!

351
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,943
Ta-da!

352
00:30:47,943 --> 00:30:51,743
I think I forgot to put chat and myself on the screen. Oops.

353
00:30:51,743 --> 00:30:54,543
Very busy day.

354
00:30:54,543 --> 00:30:57,743
Uh but I hope you guys enjoyed the birthday concert.

355
00:30:57,743 --> 00:31:00,643
It was a lot of uh recording and stuff.

356
00:31:00,643 --> 00:31:03,343
Yeah we'll talk about that now.

357
00:31:03,343 --> 00:31:06,943
Uh but at the start, did you guys get to play this game?

358
00:31:06,943 --> 00:31:10,643
Did you guys get to play with the uh claw machine?

359
00:31:10,643 --> 00:31:13,643
This was really cool uh to work on.

360
00:31:13,643 --> 00:31:17,543
It's actually interactive, so if you guys put in controls in the chat...

361
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:21,943
...like forward, grab, left, right, um up, down...

362
00:31:21,943 --> 00:31:24,543
Up down? I don't know about up down.

363
00:31:24,543 --> 00:31:28,243
But yeah this is uh something that I wanted to show.

364
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:32,543
I wanted to show grab, grab, what are you guys gonna grab?

365
00:31:29,093 --> 00:31:31,093
GOT WATSON CONCOCTION!!!

366
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:36,543
There's actually, there might be some surprises!

367
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:38,943
Oh, is it time for that huh?

368
00:31:38,943 --> 00:31:42,643
I'm just kidding, I don't have anything planned for that.

369
00:31:42,643 --> 00:31:46,543
It's just I think there's some random items in there.

370
00:31:46,543 --> 00:31:49,243
So yeah you guys can control this.

371
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:52,643
This is gonna be our new intro screen.

372
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:57,643
And it'll be really fun like if there's a day where you guys get to decide...

373
00:31:57,643 --> 00:32:01,943
...what I wear for my hat. You know, like what I wear...

374
00:32:01,943 --> 00:32:04,643
I think that'll be really cool.

375
00:32:04,643 --> 00:32:08,643
I do have some more, I have another announcement...

376
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:13,343
...but I'm gonna do it in a little bit after some chatting.

377
00:32:13,343 --> 00:32:15,943
And I guess there's some fanmade projects

378
00:32:15,943 --> 00:32:20,243
that you guys worked together on that we're gonna take a look at.

379
00:32:20,243 --> 00:32:24,643
I believe there's a VRChat world and there's also a fanbook.

380
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:27,643
So we'll probably do that.

381
00:32:27,643 --> 00:32:30,543
Um so yeah, I'm gonna put down the recap here

382
00:32:30,543 --> 00:32:33,343
because I think that... Uh...

383
00:32:33,343 --> 00:32:36,643
Okay it's gone, it's gone.

384
00:32:36,643 --> 00:32:38,943
I think the um the recap will help

385
00:32:38,943 --> 00:32:41,643
'cause people will tune in and they'll be like...

386
00:32:41,643 --> 00:32:45,643
"Wait where's the 3D Live?" Well you missed it.

387
00:32:45,643 --> 00:32:49,643
So we're gonna put the recap here, we're gonna type there...

388
00:32:49,643 --> 00:32:52,643
...so that they know that they missed it.

389
00:32:52,643 --> 00:32:55,643
And then what's up next on the list?

390
00:32:55,643 --> 00:32:59,943
Put the chat here. I'm gonna put this thingy here somewhere.

391
00:32:59,943 --> 00:33:03,093
Why don't we put this, I'll put this down here.

392
00:33:03,093 --> 00:33:05,543
What'd you guys get now?

393
00:33:05,543 --> 00:33:08,643
I'm putting it right in here.

394
00:33:08,643 --> 00:33:13,543
That way you guys can still play while I'm doing this recap thing, okay?

395
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:14,093
RECAP:

396
00:33:13,543 --> 00:33:17,943
All right recap. 3D Live.

397
00:33:17,943 --> 00:33:22,643
Maybe I should get a little checkmark symbol in here.

398
00:33:22,643 --> 00:33:26,643
I do have another announcement besides all this.

399
00:33:26,643 --> 00:33:29,643

Um what else should I put on this recap?

411
00:34:02,243 --> 00:34:06,243
I guess we haven't really done so much yet.

412
00:34:06,243 --> 00:34:09,743
Did you guys get my hat? You found my hat.

413
00:34:09,743 --> 00:34:13,243
That must be my spare then.

414
00:34:13,243 --> 00:34:16,643
Um okay so yeah I'm in Japan now

415
00:34:16,643 --> 00:34:21,543
and I actually already met up with Mumei and Kiara.

416
00:34:21,543 --> 00:34:25,643
And yeah it was fun and Mumei and I went to eat

417
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:29,643
at one of those conveyor belt places with sushi.

418
00:34:29,643 --> 00:34:33,643
That was fun. I haven't met anyone else yet,

419
00:34:33,643 --> 00:34:38,643
but I'm still, I have only been here for like a few days.

420
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:43,943
So I just been exploring and it's been really cool.

421
00:34:43,943 --> 00:34:48,943
It's crazy, Japan is pretty crazy. It's really cool.

422
00:34:48,943 --> 00:34:52,643
It feels like unreal that I'm here, you know?

423
00:34:52,643 --> 00:34:55,643
It's like a dream. It's like a dream.

424
00:35:00,105 --> 00:35:02,205
You know, getting here is with you guys...

425
00:35:02,205 --> 00:35:04,205

426
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:05,505
so thank you.

427
00:35:05,505 --> 00:35:08,605

Yeah, it's really cool. Uhm... yeah when I first got here,

449
00:37:00,405 --> 00:37:02,605
it was really nice.

450
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:05,605
I mean, it's thoroughly nice, but there's so much food everywhere.

451
00:37:05,605 --> 00:37:08,105
All the food everywhere you go,

452
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:11,105
it's like it smells good, tastes good...

453
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:15,605
Oh, I actually have an announcement. I have an announcement, a very cool announcement.

454
00:37:16,105 --> 00:37:17,605
The bread here,

455
00:37:18,505 --> 00:37:22,105
for some reason... Okay, you guys are gonna think I'm crazy or lying,

456
00:37:22,105 --> 00:37:24,105
but it doesn't make me sick!

457
00:37:24,105 --> 00:37:28,105
I haven't been sick, and I— I've been eating a ton of bread.

458
00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:33,605
I— I had like a little bit... I got a little itchy yesterday,

459
00:37:35,105 --> 00:37:37,105
uh, but I think there's a reason for that.

460
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:40,605
But I found out that I guess in the US they spray...

461
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:43,105
they spray wheat with something,

462
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:47,105
and it can— some people could be allergic to it or it's like bad for your tummy,

463
00:37:47,605 --> 00:37:50,105
but they don't do that in like other parts of the world, so...

464
00:37:50,605 --> 00:37:53,405
I don't know. Maybe it's because I've been walking— Oh!

465
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:55,305
ちょっと待ってください！
Please wait a minute!

466
00:37:55,405 --> 00:37:56,605
Ah!

467
00:37:57,805 --> 00:37:59,605
Now my ears...

468
00:38:00,105 --> 00:38:02,605
Yeah, I don't know what it is. Maybe I've been walking,

469
00:38:02,605 --> 00:38:05,605
I've been eating healthier, maybe that helps.

470
00:38:07,105 --> 00:38:09,605
Yeah, I'm not sure, but it's been really cool.

471
00:38:09,605 --> 00:38:12,105
Let's see, my favorite thing that I had so far,

472
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:15,605
I had curry udon that was really, really, really, really tasty.

473
00:38:15,605 --> 00:38:17,605
Oh, it was so good!

474
00:38:17,605 --> 00:38:20,605
I'm so happy I was able to eat it. I don't know if it made me sick or not, but...

475
00:38:22,605 --> 00:38:24,105
It was really fun.

476
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:27,605
So yeah, I— I'm planning to meet some other Hololive members...

477
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,105
soon, but uh...

478
00:38:30,605 --> 00:38:33,605
I think I do have a collab stream planned coming soon,

479
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:36,605
so you guys will have to wait and see.

480
00:38:38,605 --> 00:38:41,605
But now, I do have another announcement.

481
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:45,105
But first, I guess I'll take a look at some fan stuff. Alright.

482
00:38:46,605 --> 00:38:48,605
はい。
Yes.

483
00:40:00,717 --> 00:40:01,617
Um, yeah.

484
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:05,217
I'll be in my hotel chilling, playing Mario Kart.

485
00:40:06,017 --> 00:40:07,817
We'll be gaming.

486
00:40:08,917 --> 00:40:10,617
Any nice moss?

487
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,117
I've only seen one thing of moss,

488
00:40:13,817 --> 00:40:15,617
and I touched it and it was pretty soft.

489
00:40:15,617 --> 00:40:17,717
It was pretty soft.

490
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:21,017
No, this is not pre-recorded. It's not.

491
00:40:21,017 --> 00:40:23,817
How could it be pre-recorded? Look, you guys are like

492
00:40:23,817 --> 00:40:25,817
trying to control the claw machine right now.

493
00:40:25,817 --> 00:40:28,217
See? Isn't it addictive? It's very addictive.

494
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,917
Did I keep any dirt?

495
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:32,217
No, apparently you're not supposed to bring

496
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:33,917
any plants or dirt back.

497
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:35,517
But maybe dirt is okay.

498
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:43,817
But every time I try to buy something, it's like

499
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,417
Oh, Bubba!

500
00:40:46,117 --> 00:40:49,117
I encounter two types of people while I'm buying stuff

501
00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:51,617
here in Japan. It's like I ask them a question.

502
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:54,617
Oh, like I had to buy a hard drive, so I was like,

503
00:40:54,617 --> 00:41:00,117
「すみません。パソコンのハードドライブは、どこですか？」
“Excuse me. Where are the computer hard drives?”

504
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:05,517
And so, they might try to respond like in Japanese,

505
00:41:05,517 --> 00:41:08,617
but one thing I didn't account for

506
00:41:08,617 --> 00:41:12,417
is everybody speaks really fast. So I'm just like,

507
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:14,417
trying to listen, I'm like, "Hai, hai. Oh..."
trying to listen, I'm like, "Yes, yes. Oh..."

508
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:16,917
「あ、すみません、わかりません。」
“Oh, sorry, I don't understand.”

509
00:41:19,517 --> 00:41:23,717
Um, but then there's another type, yeah, where

510
00:41:23,717 --> 00:41:26,017
they just immediately, as soon as I speak,

511
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:28,717
they pull out their phone and they use Google Translate.

512
00:41:28,917 --> 00:41:31,517
「ありがとうございます。」
“Thank you very much.”

513
00:41:32,317 --> 00:41:35,117
Yeah, yeah. But it makes me so nervous

514
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:38,417
because, you know, even when I speak English,

515
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:41,417
I'll stutter when I'm speaking to new people,

516
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:44,317
and I'll mess up what I'm saying.

517
00:41:44,317 --> 00:41:46,717
So, you know, in another language I'm like,

518
00:41:46,717 --> 00:41:48,917
I always mess something up.

519
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:51,417
Even though I practice it in my head,

520
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:54,517
and I think it's fine. I just need to practice more.

521
00:41:55,517 --> 00:42:00,017
Um, Google Translate 助かる。助かる。
Um, Google Translate helps. It helps.

522
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:04,217
All right. I have the fan book here.

523
00:42:04,217 --> 00:42:08,617
Oh... I just gotta practice more, right?

524
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:13,117
So far I've only seen, um, I guess like,

525
00:42:13,117 --> 00:42:16,917
you know, more urban places. Yeah.

526
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:21,117
I want to see more like trees and stuff.

527
00:42:21,117 --> 00:42:23,617
Maybe I'll go to a park or something.

528
00:42:24,517 --> 00:42:27,617
I'll let everybody go to the park.

529
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:32,017
All right, apparently you guys made a birthday book.

530
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:36,517
A birthday book. It's a PDF. I'm downloading it now.

531
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:44,217
Yeah, I saw Kiara and Mumei... I don't know...

532
00:42:44,217 --> 00:42:46,717
I think Kiara talked about it a little bit,

533
00:42:46,717 --> 00:42:49,117
but yeah, we went to the arcade.

534
00:42:49,117 --> 00:42:51,617
We mostly just did claw machines there. We didn't really play...

535
00:42:51,617 --> 00:42:54,417
Oh, we played Mario Kart, and Kiara won.

536
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:57,517
Okay, she won this time!

537
00:42:58,317 --> 00:43:00,717
But I was... they kept using

538
00:43:00,717 --> 00:43:03,117
the abilities on me because I was in front.

539
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:05,517
I was first a lot of the time.

540
00:43:05,517 --> 00:43:08,417
And so, you know, if you're first,

541
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:12,117
you end up getting hit with the most items.

542
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:15,617
And she got it. She got it right at the end.

543
00:43:15,617 --> 00:43:17,617
Ow, my ears.

544
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:23,317
All right, let me try to add this.

545
00:43:26,617 --> 00:43:29,117
Okay, we're going to switch to the intro screen

546
00:43:29,117 --> 00:43:31,617
for just a second while I add this fan book.

547
00:43:35,517 --> 00:43:38,117
I'm sorry, hold on. What was it?

548
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,617
Ah, you got the time distortion! Ah!

549
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:45,417
And technically, here we go.

550
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:47,417
Now you guys can still play.

551
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:50,517
Okay, let me make the recap text smaller.

552
00:44:50,917 --> 00:44:52,517
All right, I'm going to take a look at this fan stuff.

553
00:44:52,517 --> 00:44:55,517
Thank you guys so much for all of the,

554
00:44:55,517 --> 00:44:58,517
all of the Super Chats and all of the support.

555
00:44:58,517 --> 00:45:00,117
And... I'm going to take a look at this.

556
00:45:00,129 --> 00:45:02,429
Then, thank you for all the birthday wishes...

557
00:45:02,629 --> 00:45:06,129
...and thank you for all the memberships. And thank you, thank you, thank you.

558
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:10,629
Without you guys, I wouldn't have been able to get this far celebrating our third birthday together.

559
00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:13,629
Is it our third birthday together? Our third one? So...

560
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:16,929
本当にありがとうございます！
Thank you so very much!

561
00:45:17,129 --> 00:45:21,129
Yes, wow. Our third birthday together. It went by pretty fast, though.

562
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:24,129
It went by pretty fast!

563
00:45:25,129 --> 00:45:29,129
Alright, so take a look at this fanbook. I don't know, some of you guys may have contributed.

564
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:32,129
I think there's a scroll function here.

565
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:37,129
Oh yeah! Whoa, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look! I'm just kidding. I'll let you guys look just for today, okay?

566
00:45:37,329 --> 00:45:39,629
Wow, look how pretty! Our illustration by Ardenlolo.

567
00:45:40,129 --> 00:45:44,129
Ah, it's it's it's it's... Ow! Foreword: Teammates Case File No. 002.

568
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:49,129
This book was made for the one and only Amelia Watson, including content from the VRC map portion of the project.

569
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:54,129
I don't know if we'll be able to look at the VRC map today. I'm not sure if we'll have any time.

570
00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:58,629
But, um, yeah, I definitely want to take a look at it on stream at some point. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that'd be really fun.

571
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:03,129
Messages within this book from teammates are for the eyes, only for the eyes of Ame.

572
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:06,129
Wait, does that mean I can't stream it? Oh well, you guys are you guys are put on the spot now!

573
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:08,629
Put on the spot now!

574
00:46:08,829 --> 00:46:13,629
Front cover art, rear cover art, page design, assets. Thank you, thank you!

575
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:18,129
Only one copy of the book will be printed, which will be sent to you, Ame #1237.

576
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:21,129
That's me! Uh-oh, just in case this one has been lost in another timeline, burnt by Small Ame, stolen by Bee Ame, etc.

577
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:24,129
Yes, the digital copy. You guys are all put on the spot now!

578
00:46:24,329 --> 00:46:29,129
To all Ames who have their birthday on January 6th, this project was made and compiled especially for you by teammates all over the globe.

579
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:34,129
This is our way to say thank you for all that you do for us. You mean a lot to every teammate, and this is our way to show it.

580
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:39,129
Whoa, everyone involved has worked incredibly hard to make this gift, which goes to show how special this community is that you've built...

581
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:44,129
...and all the values and inspirations you've given us. Whoa, you guys are too nice.

582
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:48,129
Here, here, let me help you guys out. Hold on. For those of you guys still playing, trying to get every item...

583
00:46:48,329 --> 00:46:53,129
I think there's some pretty rare items in there that you guys haven't gotten yet in the claw machine.

584
00:46:53,329 --> 00:46:55,129
Excuse me... Grab! What is it?

585
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:59,129
Whoa, my hat! You guys have got that one already. How many of those do you need? Do you each need a hat? Is that it?

586
00:47:00,129 --> 00:47:04,129
Uh, okay, let's see. As mentioned before, this project also includes the 3D VRC map...

587
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:08,129
...so we hope you can check it out if you have some time. This book contains the art from that map, but we still hope you check the map out.

588
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:11,629
Whoa! We apologize for any kind of scruff you might find in the book, we hope you enjoy your gift nonetheless.

589
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,629
It's okay, scruff is par for the course. Par for the course.

590
00:47:14,829 --> 00:47:18,129
Hold on, let me drink some water though. You guys having fun?

591
00:47:19,129 --> 00:47:22,129
Par for the EN course, right? Oh, my magnifying glass!

592
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:25,129
Ah! Papaya! Uh, teammates always look forward to spending more time with you...

593
00:47:25,329 --> 00:47:29,129
...and we can't wait to see more of your achievements in the future. Oh, thank you. Oh, cute! Shuzzo!

594
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:32,129
By Shuzzo! Whoa, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi!

595
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:35,129
Don't look, don't look! And a message... Ah, sorry, I think my computer's lagging a little bit. Here we go.

596
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:40,129
Thank you for always bringing joy to everyone with your stream. I can't express how much we appreciate your hard work on trying to push the boundaries of EN Vtubing...

597
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:45,129
...setting up collabs with your coworkers. Me personally, you were my first time someone used my art for a thumbnail...

598
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:49,129
...and gave me the greatest joy and motivation to continue grinding my art skill. I'm happy to see how much you've grown well since debut.

599
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:51,629
Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you! Ah, I'm happy that you let me use your art for a thumbnail. That's so sweet. Thank you, thank you.

600
00:47:52,129 --> 00:47:56,629
Ame, you are awesome beyond comprehension, truly a one of a kind human, even if you are British.

601
00:47:56,829 --> 00:48:01,129
Kidding aside, you have gone beyond measure in your endeavors as an idol, a detective, and a friend.

602
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:06,129
I wish you the happiness of all timelines combined and please know that no matter into what adventure you get into, your investigation will be behind...

603
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:08,629
...cheering and supporting you all the way! Oh, thank you!

604
00:45:00,129 --> 00:48:10,129

You guys got Bubba!

612

Oh, I miss Bubba. Bubba's doing good though.

613
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:14,441
Bubba is being watched over by Brother Watson, so...

614
00:50:14,441 --> 00:50:16,841
Bubba's having a good time.

615
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:19,541
Yeah, Bubba really likes him, so he's doing good.

616
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:23,641
Ah... "3D models off-collab with your JP senpais despite language barriers"...

617
00:50:23,641 --> 00:50:26,641
Yes! Now we'll, hopefully at some point...

618
00:50:26,641 --> 00:50:30,541
Not hopefully, there will be um, at least one off-collab that I have planned.

619
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:33,841
So, hope you guys look forward to that!

620
00:50:33,841 --> 00:50:38,141

Ah, thank you, thank you!

Ah, cute! "Keep reaching for the stars, Ame!"

625
00:50:50,141 --> 00:50:53,441
Ah, thank you! Oh, I liked this one on Twitter.

626
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:53,341
GOT SMOL AME!!

627

Ah, yes, a comic artist. "Sincerely, an Ame fan."

628
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:03,341
Ah... "I hope the concert..." It turned out pretty good, right?

629
00:51:03,341 --> 00:51:06,641
I did a lot of mocap recording for it.

630
00:51:06,641 --> 00:51:10,341
And it took me a long time to record the songs because I...

631
00:51:10,341 --> 00:51:14,141
...like, to record each song will probably take me somewhere between like...

632
00:51:14,141 --> 00:51:18,641
...three to six hours because I record it and I'm just like, "No, this is not it. This is not it."

633
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:21,941
And so I keep going and then I look at the time and I'm like, "Oh my god, I've been doing this for over two hours."

634
00:51:21,941 --> 00:51:25,641
And then I keep going until I get something I'm satisfied with!

635
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:29,641
Um, my mic doesn't get static, it's just the BGM. Okay, that's good to know.

636
00:51:29,641 --> 00:51:31,641
Oh, thank you!

637
00:51:31,641 --> 00:51:34,641
I love the Gator animation where you guys slap it to grab it.

638
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:37,141
The Bee Ame! The Bee Ame!

639
00:51:37,141 --> 00:51:39,941
Oh, you guys are so sweet! Thank you, thank you!

640
00:51:39,941 --> 00:51:43,641
¡Feliz cumpleaños! ¡Muchas gracias!
Happy birthday! Thank you very much!

641
00:51:43,641 --> 00:51:46,941
You know, actually when I was... when I like buy something here in Japan...

642
00:51:46,941 --> 00:51:49,941
...I'll be saying like, "はい、はい！"
...I'll be saying like, "Yes, yes!"

643
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:54,141
And like it's happened twice already where I accidentally went like, "¡Sí! ¡Sí! Oh, はい、はい！"
And like it's happened twice already where I accidentally went like, "Yes! Yes! Oh, yes, yes!"

644
00:51:54,141 --> 00:51:56,141
¡Perdón! すみません！
Sorry! Excuse me!

645
00:51:56,141 --> 00:52:00,141
"Saturday of March last year when I fell hard down the rabbit hole... I spent the whole day watching everything Hololive EN related."

646
00:52:00,141 --> 00:52:03,641
And I got to... all the things you did for your genmates...

647
00:52:03,641 --> 00:52:07,641
...and that was when you became my favorite. At that moment, my interest only increased over time.

648
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:10,641
"Woah! You built a 3D studio!" Yeah!

649
00:52:10,641 --> 00:52:14,441
Yes, I used the Ame Studio for the concert.

650
00:52:14,441 --> 00:52:17,641
I don't know if you guys could tell, the hands were a little... I still need to work on the hand mocap, but...

651
00:52:15,641 --> 00:52:17,641
GOT BEE AME!!

652
00:52:17,641 --> 00:52:22,141
...everything else I thought looked pretty good. There were like some hiccups every now and again with like an arm or two or...

653
00:52:22,141 --> 00:52:27,641
But yeah, I thought it turned out really nice, especially like on my official 3D model.

654
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:30,141
I thought it turned out really nice.

655
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:35,141
Yeah, huge shoutout to... That was actually my first time watching it with you guys, and I was like laughing.

656
00:52:35,141 --> 00:52:39,641
I love the Small Ame idol outfit. That was by Seafoam. I'd like to use that again at a later date...

657
00:52:39,641 --> 00:52:44,341
...because it's really cute and we only got to see it for one song! Ah!

658
00:52:44,341 --> 00:52:47,141
I'm glad you guys liked it!

659
00:52:47,141 --> 00:52:51,641
Oh, "I love your karaokes, I love all the different Ames you come up with... I love when you speak Spanish!"

660
00:52:47,641 --> 00:52:49,641
GOT GATOR PLUSHY!!

661
00:52:51,641 --> 00:52:58,341
¡Sí, sí, muchas gracias para venir a mi cumpleaños! How do you say party?
Yes, yes, thank you very much for coming to my birthday! How do you say party?

662
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,141
¡A mi fiesta! ¡Ame fiesta! ¡Ame fiesta!
To my party! Ame party! Ame party!

663
00:53:01,141 --> 00:53:03,141
¡Ame fiesta! ¡Ame fiesta!
Ame party! Ame party!

664
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:06,141
Oh, thank you! So sweet!

665
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:09,141
The Pie Maker says thank you. Oh, cute!

666
00:53:09,141 --> 00:53:12,141
Oh, I like the hair like this, all curly!

667
00:53:12,141 --> 00:53:15,141
¡Ame fiesta! Yay yay yay!
Ame party! Yay yay yay!

668
00:53:15,141 --> 00:53:20,641
"Hello, happy birthday Ame! Started to watch your streams more religiously back in March... became a member after seeing all the fun VR stuff you've done."

669
00:53:20,641 --> 00:53:22,841
Oh, thank you! Similar hobbies! やった！
Oh, thank you! Similar hobbies! Yay!

670
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:01,353
Hey, thank you for your membership!

671
00:55:01,353 --> 00:55:02,253
Oh, Gator... whoop!

672
00:55:02,253 --> 00:55:03,553
What was that? A gator what?

673
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:05,553
I haven't seen that one yet. Is that a new one?

674
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,453
Gator plushie!

675
00:55:11,953 --> 00:55:13,453
Oh, so sweet!

676
00:55:13,453 --> 00:55:15,453
...wishing you brightened up my day.

677
00:55:15,453 --> 00:55:17,453
Thank you so much for being an amazing person.

678
00:55:17,453 --> 00:55:19,553
Aw, proud to be an Investigator! So cute!

679
00:55:19,553 --> 00:55:21,153
Thank you! Are you guys just spamming Grab?

680
00:55:21,153 --> 00:55:24,553
No, you guys are planning this out, right?

681
00:55:24,553 --> 00:55:26,653
Hehe! The few of you playing.

682
00:55:27,653 --> 00:55:29,653
Thank you, thank you!

683
00:55:32,553 --> 00:55:33,753
Oh, Albert!

684
00:55:33,753 --> 00:55:36,653
And prosperous growth of the channel and community.

685
00:55:36,653 --> 00:55:39,153
Oh, thank you! Oh, you guys got it again!

686
00:55:39,153 --> 00:55:41,153
Twice in a row!

687
00:55:41,153 --> 00:55:43,153
Is it a sign? Should we have...

688
00:55:43,153 --> 00:55:45,153
...maybe we should get a Gator plushie.

689
00:55:48,153 --> 00:55:50,153
I still have one more announcement left!

690
00:55:50,153 --> 00:55:51,653
What could it be?

691
00:55:51,653 --> 00:55:53,153
I'm just kidding! It's not more merch.

692
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:59,153
By the way, the merch is...

693
00:55:59,153 --> 00:56:00,753
I think I'm blocking it with my head, oh!

694
00:56:03,153 --> 00:56:05,653
Hold on, I'll just go a little bit like this.

695
00:56:08,653 --> 00:56:10,653
The merch is on sale, yeah!

696
00:56:10,653 --> 00:56:12,653
There's the links underneath the stream.

697
00:56:12,653 --> 00:56:15,153
Oh, and you know what's interesting? I'm just saying...

698
00:56:15,153 --> 00:56:16,953
I'm a doctor. Oh wait, let me read.

699
00:56:16,953 --> 00:56:19,553
I wanted to congratulate you and thank you...

700
00:56:19,553 --> 00:56:21,153
...because your streams light up my day.

701
00:56:23,153 --> 00:56:25,153
You guys are so sweet! I'm glad you enjoyed the stream.

702
00:56:25,153 --> 00:56:28,153
Thank you, thank you!

703
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:32,353
I hope you're all having a beautiful day too!

704
00:56:32,353 --> 00:56:34,153
What happens? Can we put a timer on...

705
00:56:34,153 --> 00:56:37,153
...for how often the audio... it's like on a cycle.

706
00:56:43,153 --> 00:56:45,153
I was hearing this all throughout the concert.

707
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:47,153
But I'm glad you guys couldn't hear that.

708
00:56:48,653 --> 00:56:50,153
Aw, cute!

709
00:56:50,153 --> 00:56:52,153
Look how time flies! Ame, it's already been 3 years!

710
00:56:52,153 --> 00:56:55,153
Thank you for your hardworking spirit!

711
00:56:56,653 --> 00:56:58,653
Please drink more water, right? I actually have...

712
00:56:58,653 --> 00:57:01,153
...hold on, let me get something.

713
00:57:04,153 --> 00:57:06,153
My version of the cake, which I got from the konbini...
My version of the cake, which I got from the convenience store...

714
00:57:06,153 --> 00:57:08,153
...is a fruit sando!
...is a fruit sandwich!

715
00:57:08,153 --> 00:57:10,153
Which I don't think it makes me sick, I don't know.

716
00:57:10,153 --> 00:57:12,653
I don't want to get too TMI with you guys, but...

717
00:57:12,653 --> 00:57:15,653
...obviously since I have my PDF...

718
00:57:15,653 --> 00:57:18,153
...and I'm also a doctor. You guys are also a doctor.

719
00:57:22,153 --> 00:57:24,153
So maybe your opinion would be helpful.

720
00:57:26,653 --> 00:57:28,153
Okay, right?

721
00:57:29,653 --> 00:57:32,153
I don't know if I want to share details, but...

722
00:57:32,153 --> 00:57:34,153
Okay, you know when you eat something, okay...

723
00:57:34,153 --> 00:57:37,653
...and later, like between 3 to 8 hours later...

724
00:57:37,653 --> 00:57:39,653
...hopefully, you go to the bathroom, right?

725
00:57:39,653 --> 00:57:42,653
And something might come out, or might not.

726
00:57:42,653 --> 00:57:45,153
If you're an idol, definitely nothing would come out.

727
00:57:45,153 --> 00:57:48,653
The color can change depending on what you eat, right?

728
00:57:48,653 --> 00:57:51,653
Okay, well, sometimes people allergic to bread...

729
00:57:51,653 --> 00:57:54,653
...they eat bread, and they have to go to the bathroom...

730
00:57:54,653 --> 00:57:57,153
...right away and it makes them really sick.

731
00:57:57,153 --> 00:58:00,153
But for me, it's the opposite.

732
00:58:02,153 --> 00:58:04,653
Okay, I don't go to the bathroom, 'cause I'm an idol.

733
00:58:04,653 --> 00:58:07,153
Okay, you guys getting what I'm getting at?

734
00:58:07,153 --> 00:58:10,153
But when I eat the bread at home...

735
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,653
...it makes my tummy hurt.

736
00:58:12,653 --> 00:58:16,153
And I make such, like, all the stuff that comes out...

737
00:58:16,153 --> 00:58:18,653
...is like a weird color, okay.

738
00:58:18,653 --> 00:58:21,153
But then when I eat the bread here, everything's normal!

739
00:58:24,153 --> 00:58:26,653
So, I think it's all 大丈夫, is what I'm trying to say.
So, I think it's all fine, is what I'm trying to say.

740
00:58:26,653 --> 00:58:29,653
So I have a fruit sando here, which is my cake.
So I have a fruit sandwich here, which is my cake.

741
00:58:29,653 --> 00:58:32,653
I wanted to put some cakes from Twitter on the screen...

742
00:58:32,653 --> 00:58:34,153
...but I kind of ran out of time.

743
00:58:34,153 --> 00:58:36,653
Is it okay with you guys? Just play...

744
00:58:36,653 --> 00:58:39,153
...just play the claw machine.

745
00:58:39,153 --> 00:58:42,153
It's like when a mom, or like a parent, you know...

746
00:58:42,153 --> 00:58:44,653
...they're busy with something, so they just...

747
00:58:44,653 --> 00:58:46,653
...they give their kid an iPad. Okay.

748
00:58:46,653 --> 00:58:48,653
Can you guys... you guys look at the iPad.

749
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:53,653
I'm gonna try this fruit sando...
I'm gonna try this fruit sandwich...

750
00:58:53,653 --> 00:58:56,653
...while I search for a cake to put on the screen.

751
00:59:02,153 --> 00:59:03,653
Mmm!

752
00:59:04,153 --> 00:59:06,653
The fruit sandwiches here are so good!

753
01:00:00,365 --> 01:00:01,465
True, right?

754
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:03,265
True.

755
01:00:10,665 --> 01:00:12,865
I still haven't eaten, like...

756
01:00:13,265 --> 01:00:15,565
I want to have Tempura Udon.

757
01:00:17,465 --> 01:00:19,565
But I haven't eaten any yet.

758
01:00:20,365 --> 01:00:23,265
But when Mumei and I went to conveyor belt sushi...

759
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:27,665
...I had, like, a tempura fried shrimp.

760
01:00:27,765 --> 01:00:29,165
It was so good!

761
01:00:29,265 --> 01:00:31,565
It was so tasty.

762
01:00:34,565 --> 01:00:36,265
I want more.

763
01:00:36,365 --> 01:00:37,865
I want more.

764
01:00:38,865 --> 01:00:41,465
I also had, um...

765
01:00:41,965 --> 01:00:44,965
...even though I...

766
01:00:45,065 --> 01:00:47,465
Even though... okay, so you know like...

767
01:00:47,665 --> 01:00:49,365
...they have the ekibento...

768
01:00:49,465 --> 01:00:54,165
...which is like the type of bento that you eat while you're on like the Shinkansen or something.

769
01:00:54,565 --> 01:00:57,465
I think? Ekiben? Ekibento?

770
01:00:57,565 --> 01:01:00,765
It's like a bento you're supposed to eat while you're on a train.

771
01:01:01,265 --> 01:01:04,365
Well, I was just like exploring around and...

772
01:01:04,465 --> 01:01:08,665
...I saw like a place selling them while I was like trying to get on a train.

773
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:10,565
And, uh, I ate one.

774
01:01:10,665 --> 01:01:12,565
And it was so good!

775
01:01:12,865 --> 01:01:16,565
Oh! It had like fried rice and...

776
01:01:16,765 --> 01:01:20,665
...it had like a little tiny fried... what's it called?

777
01:01:20,965 --> 01:01:24,165
Katsu... like a pork...

778
01:01:24,265 --> 01:01:26,665
I forgot what it's called.

779
01:01:27,265 --> 01:01:28,565
Katsu...

780
01:01:30,265 --> 01:01:32,165
Katsudon?

781
01:01:35,565 --> 01:01:37,165
Katsudon? Karaage?

782
01:01:37,265 --> 01:01:39,165
It did have a piece of karaage too.

783
01:01:39,265 --> 01:01:42,665
It was just Tonkatsu! Tonkatsu!

784
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:44,965
Yeah, even though it was like cold...

785
01:01:45,165 --> 01:01:48,665
...it wasn't like crunchy or fresh, it was still so tasty!

786
01:01:48,765 --> 01:01:50,665
It was so tasty.

787
01:01:52,565 --> 01:01:56,665
The food here is so good! It's so good.

788
01:01:56,865 --> 01:02:01,965
I don't know what kind of miracle it is that I actually can eat it.

789
01:02:03,565 --> 01:02:08,665
But... I don't know, it seems like it's okay. Maybe it's because I've been walking so much.

790
01:02:09,565 --> 01:02:11,165
I don't know.

791
01:02:11,865 --> 01:02:13,665
It's... it's crazy.

792
01:02:14,065 --> 01:02:15,665
Victory Don!

793
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:18,165
Yeah, good news, right?

794
01:02:19,065 --> 01:02:22,665
I don't know, maybe it is making me sick, but I'm like powering through it or something.

795
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:25,665
I still get really sleepy.

796
01:02:27,565 --> 01:02:29,665
All right, I'm gonna...

797
01:02:31,565 --> 01:02:35,165
Um... I can't find any like cakes to put on there...

798
01:02:35,265 --> 01:02:39,165
...but there's some really, really good cake art, thank you, thank you.

799
01:02:39,265 --> 01:02:41,265
All right, let's continue with...

800
01:02:41,365 --> 01:02:42,965
...the fanbook.

801
01:02:43,065 --> 01:02:47,165
And then I want to chat with you guys for a little bit, just do some questions.

802
01:02:47,265 --> 01:02:50,165
And then that'll probably be it for our birthday stream.

803
01:02:50,265 --> 01:02:51,665
But yeah, I still want to chat.

804
01:02:52,065 --> 01:02:55,665
Ah, very cute. "Happy Birthday #1 Detective".

805
01:02:55,765 --> 01:02:57,665
By Jeys. Thank you.

806
01:03:00,565 --> 01:03:02,065
Yeah. Excuse me.

807
01:03:04,265 --> 01:03:07,665
I went to eat ramen at a place...

808
01:03:07,765 --> 01:03:10,665
...and it was like a really small place...

809
01:03:10,765 --> 01:03:13,265
...and I was like one of the only people in there.

810
01:03:13,865 --> 01:03:16,365
And the... I think it was the owner.

811
01:03:18,565 --> 01:03:22,665
The owner was there and he was like standing there with his arms crossed watching me.

812
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:25,965
And I was like really full already...

813
01:03:26,065 --> 01:03:29,665
...but I was trying to eat as much as I could.

814
01:03:29,865 --> 01:03:33,165
But afterwards, Kiara told me, she's like...

815
01:03:33,265 --> 01:03:37,165
..."Yeah, you're supposed to, you know, slurp really loudly".

816
01:03:37,265 --> 01:03:41,165
And I was like trying to be quiet because, you know...

817
01:03:41,265 --> 01:03:45,165
...I just didn't want to be like rude, I don't know, because, you know...

818
01:03:45,265 --> 01:03:48,665
...they see like a girl, they're like, "Oh, why are they being so messy?".

819
01:03:48,765 --> 01:03:50,665
You know, that sort of thing.

820
01:03:50,765 --> 01:03:54,665
But afterwards, Kiara told me that... yeah, they like want to hear you slurp really loud.

821
01:03:54,765 --> 01:03:57,165
Yeah, I was trying to be polite.

822
01:03:57,265 --> 01:04:00,665
But he was like staring me down as I was eating!

823
01:04:00,865 --> 01:04:02,665
But it was good.

824
01:04:02,765 --> 01:04:06,165
It was kind of weird. It had like some...

825
01:04:06,265 --> 01:04:08,665
...it was like ground beef or something.

826
01:04:08,865 --> 01:04:11,665
I don't know what it was, but I ate it.

827
01:04:18,865 --> 01:04:22,665
I'm sorry, I'm going for another bite of my fruit sando.

828
01:04:22,765 --> 01:04:24,965
The food here is the best!

829
01:04:25,065 --> 01:04:29,165
If you guys haven't been to Japan, I hope you can go at some point because the food is so good.

830
01:04:33,265 --> 01:04:37,665
I feel like if I never went to another country...

831
01:04:37,765 --> 01:04:40,665
...I'd probably just be satisfied.

832
01:04:40,765 --> 01:04:44,165
Just cause this is the first time I've ever gone anywhere.

833
01:04:44,265 --> 01:04:47,165
This is the first time I've ever traveled anywhere.

834
01:04:47,265 --> 01:04:51,665
You know, aside from being brought over from Englisland, which is...

835
01:04:51,765 --> 01:04:54,165
...if you guys know, you know.

836
01:04:56,865 --> 01:04:58,665
So it's my first time.

837
01:05:00,177 --> 01:05:01,977
It's scary because I thought maybe they would ask...

838
01:05:01,977 --> 01:05:03,677
...like while I was in the airport.

839
01:05:03,677 --> 01:05:05,677
I thought that customs would maybe like question...

840
01:05:05,677 --> 01:05:08,677
...whether or not, like why, why do you have a laptop?

841
01:05:08,677 --> 01:05:11,677
Why do you have a microphone? And what are you really doing here in Japan, you know?

842
01:05:11,677 --> 01:05:14,677
But thankfully nobody asked any questions. So that was nice.

843
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:17,177
It was really simple. Very easy.

844
01:05:17,177 --> 01:05:20,677
And the laptop's allowed, no no no, it's fine, it's fine.

845
01:05:20,677 --> 01:05:23,677
Yeah, it's scary going first time. I'll be here for a little while...

846
01:05:23,677 --> 01:05:27,677
...for a little while and then I'm going to go back, and then who knows...

847
01:05:27,677 --> 01:05:31,177
...I might come again, come back again soon. Alright let's continue.

848
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:34,677
Happy birthday Ame, I hope you'll have a wonderful birthday celebration this year too.

849
01:05:34,677 --> 01:05:38,177
It was pretty cool. Watching your streams always brightens up my day.

850
01:05:38,177 --> 01:05:41,677
It always brings me joy to watch and talk about your streams with other people...

851
01:05:41,677 --> 01:05:46,177
...in the community because of how friendly you taught them to be.

852
01:05:46,177 --> 01:05:50,177
Yeah, you guys are being nice right? Be nice to each other, huh?

853
01:05:50,177 --> 01:05:54,177
And to the other fanbases too, right? Yeah, yeah.

854
01:05:54,177 --> 01:05:58,177
Have I met Yagoo? Um, I met Yagoo um...

855
01:05:58,177 --> 01:06:03,177
...it was also a few months ago I met Yagoo during our first Myth off-collab.

856
01:06:03,177 --> 01:06:07,677
But I haven't seen her yet. This trip, not yet. Not yet.

857
01:06:07,677 --> 01:06:10,677
Hopefully though. Um, let's see.

858
01:06:10,677 --> 01:06:14,677
The amount of hard work you put in for your friends... I can't even count how many times...

859
01:06:14,677 --> 01:06:19,177
...your streams have watched something new or different... Thank you, thank you, thank you...

860
01:06:19,177 --> 01:06:23,677
...for the support all the way through. All the way through the journey.

861
01:06:23,677 --> 01:06:27,677
Yagoo meet up when? Um, I might be able to meet Yagoo at some point soon, I think.

862
01:06:27,677 --> 01:06:31,177
Probably. Um, alright let's see. Man I want to meet IRyS too.

863
01:06:31,177 --> 01:06:35,177
Want to meet IRyS. I know the BGM gets fuzzy.

864
01:06:35,177 --> 01:06:39,677
And then we'll see, maybe we'll meet some other senpais.

865
01:06:39,677 --> 01:06:43,177
Hopefully, lots of people to meet, right? Here we go.

866
01:06:43,177 --> 01:06:47,677
I remember following Ame... your fearlessness to be innovative...

867
01:06:47,677 --> 01:06:52,177
...you guys are too sweet. Oh, thank you, anonymous teammate. Oh thank you.

868
01:06:52,177 --> 01:06:55,177
Oh cute! Oh this cake, oh my god.

869
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:59,177
I've had so much, so many different types of cakes since I got here.

870
01:06:59,177 --> 01:07:03,177
So many different types of cakes. I had an orange cake, I had tiramisu.

871
01:07:03,177 --> 01:07:07,177
I had a strawberry... no, I don't think I've had strawberry cake yet.

872
01:07:07,177 --> 01:07:11,177
But I had pistachio cheesecake. Um, yeah and I tried like pretty much all the conbini food.

873
01:07:11,177 --> 01:07:15,677
And that was like the only thing I ate for the first two days I got here.

874
01:07:15,677 --> 01:07:19,677
I just had conbini food. They have like cream puffs, they have really tasty onigiri...

875
01:07:19,677 --> 01:07:23,677
...and these different sandwiches. Oh, like I have egg sando right now in my bag.

876
01:07:23,677 --> 01:07:28,177
They're so good, right? You have to eat the conbini food.

877
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:32,177
Because the 7-Eleven in the US, they just sell the stinky hot dogs.

878
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:36,677
But here they have like a crispy chicken, a piece of crispy chicken, it's so tasty.

879
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:40,177
And they also have um... was it? Oh yeah I had the curry bread, curry bread.

880
01:07:40,177 --> 01:07:44,177
So good. All the food here is so good. And a lot of it is like pretty cheap too.

881
01:07:44,177 --> 01:07:49,177
It's kind of crazy. How much good food there is for not even that much.

882
01:07:49,177 --> 01:07:54,043
Yes! Now the new year started after I'm done traveling. Then we'll get back to normal streams.

883
01:10:00,189 --> 01:10:02,989
Happy birthday Ame! May your special day be as epic...

884
01:10:02,989 --> 01:10:04,389
...and sweet as you are.

885
01:10:04,389 --> 01:10:05,989
Oh, this is so cute!

886
01:10:05,989 --> 01:10:07,589
I like this Smolsen.

887
01:10:07,589 --> 01:10:09,289
I like this Smolsen here.

888
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:12,489
I don't know, can you guys see my cursor?
I don't think so, but maybe.

889
01:10:15,389 --> 01:10:17,489
And this Japanese food, I can see why...

890
01:10:17,489 --> 01:10:19,089
Oh my god, everything is so tasty!

891
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:21,989
I— every time I go to bed, I'm just like so full.

892
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:24,889
It's a good thing I've been walking a lot,
so I'm like burning it off.

893
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:39,289
Well, I decided that even if it was going to make
me sick, I would still eat bread and stuff anyways.

894
01:10:41,189 --> 01:10:42,689
But it seems like it's okay.

895
01:10:42,689 --> 01:10:45,489
I mean, I get really sleepy pretty early...

896
01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:47,489
...and then I just take a nap on the train.

897
01:10:49,189 --> 01:10:51,689
And then I just keep going.

898
01:10:58,889 --> 01:11:00,889
Let me take this last bite.

899
01:11:03,689 --> 01:11:06,189
Maybe it's jet lag? Hmm... yeah, maybe.

900
01:11:10,889 --> 01:11:12,389
I'm honestly...

901
01:11:14,189 --> 01:11:18,189
Well, I got kind of lucky with my timing cause I
have a friend group that's also visiting Japan...

902
01:11:18,189 --> 01:11:21,689
...and then Hololive people as well.

903
01:11:21,689 --> 01:11:25,989
So I just kind of tag along, but then I'll also
just like go by myself...

904
01:11:25,989 --> 01:11:29,189
...and I'll get lost in some random street.

905
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:33,589
But I just keep walking because everything is so
interesting to look at, you know?

906
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:36,889
Even if it's not like the usual tourist stuff.

907
01:11:36,889 --> 01:11:40,989
I'm just going to like some of the back streets
and like the alleys and stuff like that.

908
01:11:40,989 --> 01:11:43,789
And it's so nice.

909
01:11:43,789 --> 01:11:47,489
It's fun to get lost.

910
01:11:49,689 --> 01:11:52,589
Yeah, the best way to visit, right?

911
01:11:52,589 --> 01:11:55,889
No, not the backrooms. Yeah, back alleys.

912
01:12:02,689 --> 01:12:07,589
And even like compared to the US, everything is
so clean and the buildings are so cute!

913
01:12:08,689 --> 01:12:11,889
I see some like vending machines that they look
like I could pick them up, you know what I mean?

914
01:12:16,989 --> 01:12:21,189
Oh my god, and I've done so much
gacha gacha, gachapon!

915
01:12:22,189 --> 01:12:23,689
痛てっ！
Ouch!

916
01:12:25,689 --> 01:12:28,189
I've done so much gacha.

917
01:12:28,189 --> 01:12:30,189
It's great.

918
01:12:32,489 --> 01:12:34,689
Gacha everywhere.

919
01:12:34,689 --> 01:12:39,289
Every time I see like a few I'm just like,
'Okay hold on, let me pull out my coin purse.'

920
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,989
Got anything good?

921
01:12:43,389 --> 01:12:48,489
I did get some good stuff, but I don't remember
right now off the top of my head, so maybe it wasn't that good.

922
01:12:52,689 --> 01:12:54,789
Is it cold in Japan?

923
01:12:54,789 --> 01:12:58,489
It's a little cold, but it's nice.

924
01:12:58,489 --> 01:13:00,989
The wind is really cold.

925
01:13:02,489 --> 01:13:05,089
Ooh, long hair Ame! Art by Zen! Thank you!

926
01:13:10,689 --> 01:13:15,689
Yeah, cold is better than hot, right? Cause it's
like when you're hot, you can only take off so much clothes.

927
01:13:15,689 --> 01:13:18,189
You can't take off your skin.

928
01:13:18,189 --> 01:13:22,189
But when you're cold you just put on more clothes, so easy.

929
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:26,689
Hi Ame, I'm a long time viewer of yours,
and while you may not see my name in chat,

930
01:13:26,689 --> 01:13:31,189
but I really do love your content and streams.
I've watched the streams you do since debut,

931
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:34,689
even though I can't sub, but I hope and got membership...
so I try to support your content by watching.

932
01:13:34,689 --> 01:13:38,989
I hope someday I will be able to get a membership.
But keep doing what you're doing,

933
01:13:38,989 --> 01:13:41,989
the streams are great and entertaining.
I will always try to catch your streams.

934
01:13:41,989 --> 01:13:44,389
Thank you for many great ones and hope it
will keep on going. Thank you Ame! Iris-chi.

935
01:13:44,389 --> 01:13:49,189
Well thank you Iris-chi! I hope I said it right.
See, this is why gifted memberships are nice

936
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:52,189
cause look, some people can't get it, but they
might get lucky in the chat and get some gifted ones.

937
01:13:52,189 --> 01:13:54,189
It's so sweet, thank you so much.

938
01:13:56,689 --> 01:14:00,989
Hi Ame, happy birthday! Your streams have gotten
me through many hard days throughout the past two years,

939
01:14:00,989 --> 01:14:05,689
and brighten many more. You're an inspiration to
me and watching you motivates me to grow my creativity

940
01:14:05,689 --> 01:14:10,189
and work ethic. Ah, my work ethic needs some
work too. Thank you for all your hard work

941
01:14:10,189 --> 01:14:14,189
and you put into your projects and streams, looking
forward to seeing what you do and accomplish in the future.

942
01:14:14,189 --> 01:14:16,389
Well thank you, Rinsuke.

943
01:14:18,189 --> 01:14:21,189
Thank you for always working hard, your smile gives
happiness to many people, thank you so much, Zinia.

944
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:24,189
Oh, actually I have an asset that Zen made for me.
Is this like a... hold on.

945
01:14:28,189 --> 01:14:31,689
I'll just leave it. What'd I do? What'd I do?

946
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:41,389
Ah, thank you for the gifts! No, I wasn't trying to
get you guys to gift... oh, I see because it's supposed to be a book!

947
01:14:41,389 --> 01:14:44,189
Ah, yeah yeah yeah, this is the other side.

948
01:14:48,189 --> 01:14:51,189
Ah, thank you, thank you, thank you for the gifts.

949
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:56,189
Dear Ame, Happy birthday Ame! Three birthdays already!
Time flies by so fast... oh this is cute!

950
01:15:00,201 --> 01:15:01,501
...letter. Like, it's just like a scan of a letter.

951
01:15:01,643 --> 01:15:02,301
Ah!

952
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:08,701
I hope the birthday girl is having a wonderful birthday.

953
01:15:09,001 --> 01:15:12,001
Thank you for introducing the rest of Hololive to me, always so supportive of your friends...

954
01:15:12,001 --> 01:15:14,501
...and coworkers, Holo-Birds just to Holo-Pro, for me...

955
01:15:14,501 --> 01:15:17,501
...as a Teammate, to feel like part of a big Hololive family.

956
01:15:17,601 --> 01:15:20,701
Supportive of anything and creativity has created countless memories...

957
01:15:20,701 --> 01:15:22,701
...for other Holo members and Teammates.

958
01:15:23,001 --> 01:15:23,901
Mmm!

959
01:15:24,201 --> 01:15:26,701
When you debuted, I was still just a kid, living the toughest years of my life...

960
01:15:26,701 --> 01:15:28,701
...seeing things I'd rather forget.

961
01:15:29,001 --> 01:15:30,701
You've come into my life...

962
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:34,001
...always streaming early morning in my time zone, gave me something to look forward to...

963
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:36,001
...every time I wake up.

964
01:15:36,101 --> 01:15:38,701
Watching streams to start my day always brightens me up, and being developed since this year.

965
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:41,201
Ah! A kid while watching. Mmm.

966
01:15:44,701 --> 01:15:47,501
Seen attitude and values, you do things in your own way...

967
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:50,701
...doing things you know is right for you, even when people tell you otherwise.

968
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:52,701
It's truly an inspiration...

969
01:15:52,701 --> 01:15:55,501
...and has helped me make some important decisions.

970
01:15:57,801 --> 01:16:00,201
Aww, well I'm glad I could help! Keep working hard.

971
01:16:00,701 --> 01:16:03,701
Yeah, growing up isn't an easy road.

972
01:16:05,701 --> 01:16:08,701
But, I'm glad you enjoyed the streams. Thank you so much for all your support.

973
01:16:09,001 --> 01:16:12,001
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

974
01:16:14,501 --> 01:16:17,701
Oh, there's so much of this book, and I want to go through all of it...

975
01:16:17,701 --> 01:16:19,701
...but I don't think we'll have time.

976
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:23,201
Aw, so cute! Gismo! Look at this cute art!

977
01:16:23,501 --> 01:16:25,701
Hehe!

978
01:16:27,701 --> 01:16:31,201
You're someone I met on the other side of the world, you can't imagine I say I love you, what!

979
01:16:31,501 --> 01:16:34,201
Ah!

980
01:16:35,501 --> 01:16:38,501
Oh, so sweet! So cute!

981
01:16:38,701 --> 01:16:41,001
So cute, so cute, so cute!

982
01:16:41,201 --> 01:16:43,201
Wwwwww.

983
01:16:44,201 --> 01:16:46,701
This art is really good too.

984
01:16:46,701 --> 01:16:48,001
Ah, so cute!

985
01:16:48,201 --> 01:16:51,001
Alright, alright. We'll be scrolling all day if we stay here...

986
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:54,201
...so I'm going to look at the rest off-stream, and... um...

987
01:16:54,201 --> 01:16:57,701
...I think my manager mentioned something about possibly getting an actual printed version...

988
01:16:57,701 --> 01:16:59,701
...maybe at some point.

989
01:17:00,201 --> 01:17:04,001
So I'm looking forward to that, actually holding it in my hands, and...

990
01:17:04,001 --> 01:17:06,001
I'm going to keep it on my coffee table. Is that weird?

991
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:08,001
I'm going to keep it on my coffee table.

992
01:17:08,001 --> 01:17:09,001
Haha!

993
01:17:09,001 --> 01:17:12,501
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

994
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:17,001
Uh, alright. Now you guys plan on your iPad. Give me a second.

995
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:18,701
Hehe!

996
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:20,701
You give me one moment.

997
01:17:21,701 --> 01:17:24,201
Ah, hold on, I wanted to, um... do this.

998
01:17:32,501 --> 01:17:35,701
It is just so sweet. Thank you so much for all the work put into the fan book. It's really nice.

999
01:17:35,701 --> 01:17:38,701
It's really nice, and I can't wait to get, uh, a hardcopy version.

1000
01:17:46,701 --> 01:17:50,201
I'm going to bring the crane up here, but give me a second.

1001
01:18:00,201 --> 01:18:03,701
We'll put it right here. There.

1002
01:18:04,701 --> 01:18:07,701
Okay, just give me a second while I prepare one more thing. I'm going to do my...

1003
01:18:07,701 --> 01:18:10,701
...final announcement. Final announcement, I believe.

1004
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:14,501
Coz then it's time to get ready for Mario Kart!

1005
01:18:20,701 --> 01:18:22,701
Let me see.

1006
01:18:38,701 --> 01:19:02,701
(Humming melody)

1007
01:19:03,701 --> 01:19:06,701
Ah, looking for the perfect files. Excuse me.

1008
01:19:24,701 --> 01:19:26,701
All right, we're going to hide... uh...

1009
01:19:26,701 --> 01:19:30,201
...we're going to hide this for a second actually. Oh, let's... let's... so you guys get the last item.

1010
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:34,001
Huh, Bubba!

1011
01:19:35,001 --> 01:19:37,501
Bubba plushie! Alright, we'll pause.

1012
01:19:39,701 --> 01:19:42,701
Actually, let me move over. We'll put it here for a second.

1013
01:19:44,201 --> 01:19:46,701
We'll go this way. Put this here.

1014
01:19:56,701 --> 01:19:58,201
Okay.

1015
01:20:11,413 --> 01:20:12,213
Oh.

1016
01:20:25,613 --> 01:20:28,213
All right, are you guys ready? We're going to play a game.

1017
01:20:28,313 --> 01:20:30,713
Now everything's ready.

1018
01:20:31,213 --> 01:20:34,213
Tada! Wait, tada! Wait, you can't see it.

1019
01:20:34,313 --> 01:20:36,713
Tada! Wait, can you guys see that?

1020
01:20:37,213 --> 01:20:39,713
Okay, there. There we go.

1021
01:20:39,813 --> 01:20:41,713
What is that? There's a new item on the screen.

1022
01:20:41,713 --> 01:20:43,713
GOT SMOL AME!!!

1023
01:20:43,813 --> 01:20:45,213
There is a new item.

1024
01:20:45,313 --> 01:20:47,213
Can you guys get that?

1025
01:20:47,313 --> 01:20:50,213
Are you guys able to grab that? I don't know.

1026
01:20:50,313 --> 01:20:54,213
It's kind of in a weird spot, huh?

1027
01:20:54,313 --> 01:20:57,213
Kind of in a weird spot.

1028
01:20:57,313 --> 01:21:00,213
I need you guys to grab it.

1029
01:21:08,013 --> 01:21:10,213
Uh, a little bit more to the right. Okay.

1030
01:21:10,313 --> 01:21:13,713
A little more to the right. You guys got the the concert start symbol really fast.

1031
01:21:17,013 --> 01:21:19,713
Really, really fast.

1032
01:21:23,713 --> 01:21:27,213
A little bit more to the right. Come on, come on.

1033
01:21:29,713 --> 01:21:31,713
Oh, you guys are so close.

1034
01:21:31,813 --> 01:21:33,713
You're so close.

1035
01:21:33,813 --> 01:21:36,713
Oh! Right there, it's right there, it's right there.

1036
01:21:36,813 --> 01:21:39,213
Don't grab yet. Don't grab yet.

1037
01:21:39,313 --> 01:21:41,713
The shadow, do you guys see the shadow? It's like almost on it.

1038
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:44,213
You might be able to get it.

1039
01:21:44,313 --> 01:21:46,213
Wait, oh! Right there, right there. Okay.

1040
01:21:46,313 --> 01:21:48,213
Grab, grab, grab!

1041
01:21:49,213 --> 01:21:52,213
Eh? Okay, that should be good if you go that far.

1042
01:21:52,313 --> 01:21:55,213
Are you guys... you guys are over it, I think.

1043
01:21:55,313 --> 01:21:56,713
Grab!

1044
01:21:57,713 --> 01:22:00,713
Oh! Yep! What is it?

1045
01:22:00,813 --> 01:22:03,713
GOT ORIGINAL SONG PREVIEW

1046
01:22:01,213 --> 01:22:05,713
Original song preview! I misspelled it.

1047
01:22:05,813 --> 01:22:08,713
That's right, I have an original song... now.

1048
01:22:08,813 --> 01:22:13,213
But it won't be releasing until the 14th of January.

1049
01:22:13,313 --> 01:22:17,213
So you guys do have to wait.

1050
01:22:17,313 --> 01:22:20,713
But I have some more surprises in store for that.

1051
01:22:20,813 --> 01:22:24,213
Hold on, I have a logo that I am going to put here,

1052
01:22:24,313 --> 01:22:26,713
which I totally did not prepare beforehand.

1053
01:22:26,813 --> 01:22:29,713
But I do have a little preview that I'm going to show you guys.

1054
01:22:30,213 --> 01:22:32,713
I have a little preview that I'll show you.

1055
01:22:32,813 --> 01:22:36,713
Just give me a second while I put this on the screen.

1056
01:22:37,213 --> 01:22:40,713
An original song, finally!

1057
01:22:43,213 --> 01:22:46,213
And here it is.

1058
01:22:46,313 --> 01:22:49,213
It's called... wait, let me move this over.

1059
01:22:49,313 --> 01:22:51,713
It's called...

1060
01:22:53,213 --> 01:22:57,213
Ta-da! Chiku Taku. Chiku Taku,

1061
01:22:57,313 --> 01:22:59,213
which means tick-tock,

1062
01:22:59,313 --> 01:23:02,213
but it's not, you know, it's Chiku-Chiku Taku.

1063
01:23:02,313 --> 01:23:05,213
Not tick-tock. Chiku Taku.

1064
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:09,213
Okay, I'm going to play a little preview for you guys.

1065
01:23:09,313 --> 01:23:12,713
There's no vocals, but it's a really nice preview,

1066
01:23:12,813 --> 01:23:16,213
and you guys will have to wait until January 14th PST.

1067
01:23:16,313 --> 01:23:19,713
It'll be January 15th JST.

1068
01:23:19,813 --> 01:23:22,713
You guys will have to wait to hear it then.

1069
01:23:22,813 --> 01:23:25,213
But for now, please listen.

1070
01:23:25,313 --> 01:23:28,713
Hopefully it doesn't get buzzy, but please listen.

1071
01:23:34,113 --> 01:23:35,213
Sorry.

1072
01:23:54,413 --> 01:23:56,713
Sorry. Can you hear it?

1073
01:24:26,713 --> 01:24:30,713
Okay, I'll let it play one more time because last time it got messed up.

1074
01:24:30,813 --> 01:24:33,213
Okay, from the beginning one more time.

1075
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:31,125
Yay!

1076
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:35,225
So yeah, that's... it's kind of a different mix...

1077
01:25:36,025 --> 01:25:40,625
But you guys will be able to hear the full original song,

1078
01:25:40,625 --> 01:25:44,425
obviously with vocals, on January 14th.

1079
01:25:44,425 --> 01:25:48,725
So please listen and please wait for the music video premiere

1080
01:25:48,725 --> 01:25:51,425
on January 14th.

1081
01:25:51,425 --> 01:25:54,225
I just had to delay it a little bit to finish up something for it.

1082
01:25:54,725 --> 01:25:56,725
But you guys will see.

1083
01:25:56,725 --> 01:26:00,225
And yeah, I have some more surprises in store on that day.

1084
01:26:00,225 --> 01:26:03,425
So we'll do another stream for sure on that day

1085
01:26:03,425 --> 01:26:05,725
during the premiere

1086
01:26:05,725 --> 01:26:08,725
and we'll do like a watch-along and yeah, some other stuff.

1087
01:26:35,725 --> 01:26:38,425
I really can't wait for you guys to hear it,

1088
01:26:38,425 --> 01:26:41,225
the official version. So yes, please look forward to it.

1089
01:26:41,225 --> 01:26:44,725
And I'm gonna end this stream right about now.

1090
01:26:44,725 --> 01:26:48,025
As the pinned message showed before, the merch top pinned...

1091
01:26:48,025 --> 01:26:51,425
I will be reading super chats at a later date.

1092
01:26:51,425 --> 01:26:53,625
I'd like to read them

1093
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,725
even though I'm gonna have a lot, a lot piled up.

1094
01:26:56,725 --> 01:26:58,425
But I'd still like to do it anyways.

1095
01:26:58,425 --> 01:27:01,225
So thank you guys so much for all your support.

And Melon Turtle for this really cool new background that we have.

1117
01:28:12,725 --> 01:28:17,225
やった！ I'm gonna make sure I'm not missing anything.
Yay! I'm gonna make sure I'm not missing anything.

1118
01:28:17,725 --> 01:28:19,725
Oh, and to K-Ace...

1119
01:28:19,725 --> 01:28:22,725
I think it's K-Ace? For the quick mix.

1120
01:28:22,725 --> 01:28:25,725
Yes, thank you Calli for the connection,

1121
01:28:25,725 --> 01:28:28,225
the connect, the hookup.

1122
01:28:29,025 --> 01:28:33,725
Happy birth... oh thank you guys! Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1123
01:28:34,025 --> 01:28:37,725
I will be exploring Japan, so I do...

1124
01:28:37,725 --> 01:28:41,725
I would like to stream some more and do some off-collab streams.

1125
01:28:45,025 --> 01:28:47,725
So I'll keep you guys updated and I'll let you know.

1126
01:28:47,725 --> 01:28:51,725
And now that it's known that I'm here in Japan, I'd like to share,

1127
01:28:51,725 --> 01:28:55,425
you know, some... some maybe some stuff I've eaten.

1128
01:28:55,425 --> 01:28:58,425
Not very identifiable things.

1129
01:29:00,225 --> 01:29:03,725
But yeah, I'll take some pictures of food for you guys.

1130
01:29:04,025 --> 01:29:07,725
And I'll probably be updating the members with that more likely.

1131
01:29:07,725 --> 01:29:11,025
I'm too nervous to post it like on Twitter.

1132
01:29:11,025 --> 01:29:13,725
But yeah, thank you guys!

1133
01:29:13,725 --> 01:29:18,225
Thank you for watching and thank you for all your support.

1134
01:29:18,225 --> 01:29:21,425
And I hope you had fun. I had fun this birthday.

1135
01:29:21,725 --> 01:29:25,025
So thank you guys for all the love.

1136
01:29:25,025 --> 01:29:27,725
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1137
01:29:27,725 --> 01:29:31,225
I can't wait for you guys to hear the original song.

1138
01:29:31,225 --> 01:29:34,725
I hope that this birthday stream met your guys' expectations.

1139
01:29:34,725 --> 01:29:38,425
I worked really hard on the mocap and the dancing,

1140
01:29:38,425 --> 01:29:41,725
which I definitely need to work on that more.

1141
01:29:41,725 --> 01:29:44,425
And the recording... and the recording for the song.

1142
01:29:44,425 --> 01:29:46,725
And planning a lot of things out.

1143
01:29:46,725 --> 01:29:49,225
And yeah, I can't wait for January 14th.

1144
01:29:50,225 --> 01:29:52,725
It was great! Um, glad you guys liked it.

1145
01:29:52,725 --> 01:29:54,725
Alright, I'm gonna go now.

1146
01:29:54,725 --> 01:29:58,225

1147
01:30:10,687 --> 01:30:11,687
