00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,200
Hello, everybody!

3
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,000
Welcome to my 3D debut!

4
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh god, what year is it? Where am I?

5
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,500
Well, we're here in my office. Hello, everyone!

6
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,000
Hi!

7
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,000
Whee!

8
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,000
So today we have some exciting stuff happening,

9
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,000
but don't you guys want to see my desk and my office?

10
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,800
Isn't this nice? Ooh! Wow!

11
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,500
Got all these papers here.

12
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,000
Shall we do a spin?

13
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hyoo!

14
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,200
We're watching the pre-chat and you guys were being so cute.

15
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Thank you for coming.

16
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,500
あ、こんにちわっつ、皆さん、ありがとう！
Ah, konnichiwa-tsu, everyone, thank you!

17
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
I'm gonna try to put my feet up on this desk. Let's see if it works.

18
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,800
Kyuu! Yoh! Ta-da!

19
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,000
Just, you know, just hanging around. Just chillin'.

20
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,800
Hey, I want to get some cool screenshots. Make sure you guys take pictures.

21
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,000
You can post them on Twitter with this hashtag. Yeah.

22
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,500
Kick back, relax, you know, just thinking around.

23
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,500
Ooh. Maybe I'll just take a nap.

24
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,000
I've been working so hard for this, for today's showcase,

25
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,200
and now I just want to take a break.

26
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,500
Oh, who's this? There's people here. Oh, pictures. Let's see.

27
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Uh, who was first? Ina! First had her debut.

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,500
Ina's debut. So cute. I love her. She does this so well.

29
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't know how she does it. And mine looks pretty cool, too, right?

30
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Eh, and then we have Kiara? Kiara what? Or Calli first?

31
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:12,000
No, it was Kiara first. Yeah. Wasn't it? Ah, the worm.

32
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Oh, sorry, just reading chat. Okay, yeah.

33
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,000
And then after it was Calli and then Gura was yesterday.

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,500
Their debuts were so fun to watch. We have a collab happening tomorrow, too.

35
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,000
So make sure to tune into that. But first...

36
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,500
...don't you guys want to see my office? Yay!

37
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,200
I want to see how fast it can go. Bum bum bum bum bum bum...

38
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,800
Very high speeds. Wait, I'm gonna get dizzy. Okay.

39
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,500
All right. Let me scoot on over here. I want to show you guys around my office.

40
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Scoot, scoot. Oh. Oh my god. It's like the first time reveal.

41
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You guys have never seen this before, right? Ooh! Whistle, whistle. Ho!

42
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:01,133
Oh!

43
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:04,233
Look at these nice kicks. Cute, cute, cute, cute.

44
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:05,833
Pop, pop!

45
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:08,533
Heh, cool, right? Uh, what are those?

46
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:10,533
So smooth.

47
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,533
What are you looking at?

48
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:20,533
Oh, oh, and my watch.

49
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:25,033
Brrrr! We time traveled. What year is it?

50
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,033
Okay, let's see.

51
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,533
Yeah! Ta-da!

52
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:40,033
Finally, full high quality official 3D. Let's go!

53
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,533
All right. Well, should I show you guys around

54
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,033
over here?

55
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:52,533
Bubba! Bubba made it all the way to Japan!

56
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,533
Eh, Bubba's so cute!

57
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,033
Oh Bubba, pet-the-pet-the-pet-the.

58
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:02,033
Eh Bubba, Bubba... maybe Bubba knows some tricks.

59
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,533
Bubba! Bubba can fly!

60
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,533
It's magic!

61
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:11,233
Bubba, how are you doing that? Maybe it's his cape.

62
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,033
The cape's making him fly.

63
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,833
Eh Bubba, can you do... Bubba do flip.

64
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,033
Let's see if Bubba can do flip.

65
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,533
Holy shit, he did a flip!

66
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:24,033
Now if you guys ask for it, there it is.

67
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:25,833
There's the flip.

68
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,533
Bubba, Bubba's so small, right?

69
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:31,533
I wonder if Bubba can sit down.

70
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:33,533
Maybe Bubba can sit over here.

71
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:38,533
Bubba use the chair. Bubba use the chair.

72
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:45,033
Bubba's a detective now! Wow, how cute!

73
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:50,033
Eh, I want to see from the desk. Bubba, cute, cute, cute.

74
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,033
Okay Bubba. Bubba jump!

75
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:04,033
Eh, can Bubba dance? Bubba dance, Bubba dance!

76
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,533
Oh, Bubba, good boy! Good boy, Bubba! So cute, right?

77
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,333
All right Bubba, come on this way.

78
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,533
I want to show you guys around my office a little bit.

79
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,033
Ta-da!

80
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,033
This is a conspiracy board,

81
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,233
and I'm at the center of it all.

82
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:26,533
But this is... this is evil Ame, right?

83
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:29,033
We don't look exactly the same, see?

84
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,533
That one's evil. I'm the good Ame.

85
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:34,533
Aha. Yes, yes, totally.

86
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,533
Right Bubba? That Ame's evil. Bubba, attack!

87
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:47,533
All right, over here. Fish tank, fish tank!

88
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,833
Yeah, there's no fish in it, but it's pretty, right?

89
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,033
Bubba ate all the fish. Bubba was hungry.

90
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,833
Oh, there's no fish in there yet. They did not die.

91
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,033
They were... Bubba ate them. They're just sleeping.

92
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:06,333
Um, and then over here the window. Ah, I love having a window in the back.

93
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,533
I mean this one, I need to clean it a little bit, I'm not gonna lie.

94
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:11,533
It needs a little bit of a scrub.

95
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:16,533
And then we have the stars up here. Wow!

96
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,533
They're too high, I can't reach.

97
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,533
And then the monitors so I can look at chat.

98
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:26,833
This is definitely where I'm looking at chat.

99
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:31,033
And not somewhere else in the room. Yes, right here. Right here.

100
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,233
And of course my mixing set.

101
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,033
And now over here. Oh...

102
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:40,033
Sus.

103
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,233
These are the ones on the desk were the good Myth members,

104
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:46,033
but these are the evil versions.

105
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,033
Sus.

106
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,033
Sus.

107
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,033
Sus.

108
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,533
And just a little sus. Oh yeah.

109
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,533
Well, we have some things, you know, to get to.

110
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:06,533
I'll show you a little bit more over here.

111
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,533
These are my boxes I need to unpack.

112
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,833
Did you guys know that box is hako in Japanese?

113
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,533
Doesn't it sound familiar? Like a certain something...

114
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,533
Getting a phone call.

115
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,533
I have a phone? Oh yeah, I do have a phone.

116
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:27,533
Let me see. I wonder who it could be.

117
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,833
もしもし
Hello?

118
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:34,533
Huh? Yagoo? Yagoo's on the phone. He's calling me.

119
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,533
Hold on let me sit. Gotta sit for this.

120
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:38,533
Uh, huh.

121
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,533
はい。なるほど。お。
Yes. I see. Oh.

122
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:45,533
え？本当ですか？
Eh? Really?

123
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:50,033
Okay, okay. Uh-huh. Okay.

124
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,033
Really important phone call, item meeting.

125
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,533
Actually, there's a case for us to go check out.

126
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,033
A crime scene.

127
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:00,945
I mean...

128
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:04,945
We've gotta go and see what the heck all that was about.

129
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:08,545
Let's go to detective work!

130
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:10,545
やったー！ババ、カモン！
Yatta! Bubba, come on!

131
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:27,245
Huh?

132
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:29,945
A crime scene right here in the middle of the street?

133
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:33,845
I guess this is what YAGOO called me for.

134
00:10:34,545 --> 00:10:38,245
Hmm... We should take a really close look,

135
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:40,945
examine all the clues and try to figure out who might be behind this.

136
00:10:41,545 --> 00:10:45,945
I guess the investigators came by and prepped this scene already for me.

137
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,045
We have the outline of a body here,

138
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:54,545
and one, two, three, four... four clues.

139
00:10:57,545 --> 00:11:00,245
Well, before I touch anything,

140
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:03,545
my hands are clean, don't worry, I'm going to take a picture.

141
00:11:03,645 --> 00:11:04,445
Let's take a picture.

142
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:05,945
Hold on, let me get my camera.

143
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:12,845
Alright. This is better before I infect everything with my germs and fingerprints.

144
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:15,545
Let's take a look.

145
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:18,945
Take a picture here. Gun.

146
00:11:23,045 --> 00:11:24,545
Now let's see here.

147
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:25,845
A banana?

148
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:28,945
What's this doing here?

149
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:33,245
Okay...

150
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:37,445
Let me just take one of the crime scene in total.

151
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:45,445
And here we have... what is this, a machete?

152
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:47,345
A gun? I mean, a knife?

153
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:50,545
Hmm.

154
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,245
And lastly we have...

155
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:57,545
a hat. Baseball cap.

156
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:59,545
Let me see.

157
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:01,845
Alright, let's take a picture.

158
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:09,545
Okay, I'm gonna have to get closer now.

159
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,545
Let me get my magnifying glass out of my pocket.

160
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:21,045
Alright. First, let's have a look at this banana.

161
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:23,945
This banana really caught my interest.

162
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:31,145
It looks unopened, uneaten banana. Let me take a look.

163
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:38,545
I don't see any bruises on it yet.

164
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:42,545
So, maybe... maybe what happened is

165
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:46,045
they were walking down the street and about to eat their banana

166
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:48,845
when somebody attacked them.

167
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,845
Alright, let me take a look at this hat.

168
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:02,145
Baseball cap.

169
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:07,545
They were probably wearing this and it's pretty far from their head.

170
00:13:08,645 --> 00:13:10,945
There's no blood on it, so...

171
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:15,545
let me take a closer look.

172
00:13:18,645 --> 00:13:20,945
Maybe somebody wanted their hat?

173
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:23,845
Maybe somebody was trying to steal their hat, I wonder,

174
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:26,545
and tried taking it from them while they were eating a banana...

175
00:13:26,645 --> 00:13:28,845
about to eat a banana.

176
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,245
Alright, let me take a look at this.

177
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:37,445
Let me see.

178
00:13:38,245 --> 00:13:40,845
We have this machete.

179
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:46,545
It doesn't look like there's any marks on it,

180
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:49,445
so they probably didn't even get to use this.

181
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:53,345
I don't think that that's the murder weapon,

182
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:55,245
but maybe...

183
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:58,245
maybe a case of self-defense.

184
00:13:59,645 --> 00:14:02,345
Alright, and last but not least, let's take a look at the gun,

185
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:05,145
which I suspect to be the murder weapon.

186
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,145
Let's see.

187
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:09,145
Shiny?

188
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:12,845
It's like a skin, very shiny skin on this.

189
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,845
Pretty flashy looking gun.

190
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:20,645
Let me think.

191
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:25,545
Well, maybe what happened was that they were walking down the street

192
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:28,045
after just buying a fresh banana,

193
00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:30,945
and they were about to eat it when suddenly

194
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:33,445
somebody attacked them

195
00:14:33,545 --> 00:14:35,845
and wanted their hat?

196
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,245
What do you guys think?

197
00:14:41,345 --> 00:14:46,345
Could it be maybe somebody was filming like a TikTok video or something?

198
00:14:46,645 --> 00:14:48,845
I mean, look at how their pose was.

199
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:52,245
Maybe... no, it's probably like "No, please!"

200
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:55,345
But it kind of looks like they're doing a, you know, (mimes shooting).

201
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:58,245
Well...

202
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:01,407
I think I...

203
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:02,377
...I missed one.

204
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:04,007
There's something over here.

205
00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:06,057
Hold on, I need to get a closer look.

206
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:07,807
I'll show you guys.

207
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:12,657
Whoa! Hehe.

208
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:15,557
Now I have the view, huh?

209
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:18,557
Footsteps.

210
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:20,057
Hold on.

211
00:15:20,357 --> 00:15:23,557
Let me get this for archive purposes.

212
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:25,857
Whole scene.

213
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:28,157
Hmm...

214
00:15:29,007 --> 00:15:31,057
Their legs are spread so wide.

215
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:32,457
What happened?

216
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:34,257
Huh?

217
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:37,057
Okay.

218
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:40,057
Now let's take a closer look here.

219
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:42,157
Footsteps.

220
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:44,907
Hmm. These are way smaller than my feet.

221
00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:47,357
Super small footsteps.

222
00:15:47,357 --> 00:15:49,157
Wait. Small footsteps?

223
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:50,557
Hmm...

224
00:15:52,057 --> 00:15:53,157
I wonder.

225
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:56,557
Hmm...

226
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,857
Let's think this through.

227
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:02,157
Small footsteps...

228
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:03,057
...banana...

229
00:16:03,507 --> 00:16:05,157
...a hat that somebody wanted...

230
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:08,157
...a shiny gun?

231
00:16:08,557 --> 00:16:09,557
Wait a second.

232
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:12,057
Why is this ringing bells?

233
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:13,307
Huh?

234
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:14,357
Could it be?

235
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:15,607
Could it be?

236
00:16:15,857 --> 00:16:16,857
Wait, what is that?

237
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:19,457
I hear... I hear something from up there.

238
00:16:19,957 --> 00:16:20,357
Huh?

239
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:21,107
What...

240
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:22,357
...what is that?

241
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:40,557
WHOOOOOOO!

242
00:16:44,257 --> 00:16:46,157
Wah ha ha ha!

243
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:48,557
You dare enter my dimension?

244
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:52,607
This city ain't big enough for the two of us.

245
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:55,357
Especially with your fat ass!

246
00:16:59,057 --> 00:17:00,057
Oh!

247
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:01,357
Not this again!

248
00:17:01,557 --> 00:17:04,607
Smol Ame, I could tell it was you from these clues.

249
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:08,457
Appearing at the crime scene just confirms it.

250
00:17:09,557 --> 00:17:12,357
Smol Ame, I'm putting you under citizen's arrest!

251
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:16,257
Hehe! You fell right for my trap!

252
00:17:21,857 --> 00:17:23,557
Take this!

253
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:25,557
Look at this! Ugh!

254
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:28,207
Keep missing, it's the ping!

255
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,557
I got hit.

256
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:41,057
Ugh...

257
00:17:47,857 --> 00:17:49,057
Ah, don't worry guys.

258
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:51,357
These are tranquilizer darts, not real bullets.

259
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:56,257
Phew!

260
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:58,857
Usually I would take you back to the office for holding...

261
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:00,057
...until police arrive, but...

262
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:02,357
I have guests coming over.

263
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:03,157
Hmm...

264
00:18:03,507 --> 00:18:04,957
Here, this should do the trick.

265
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:10,057
And...

266
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:11,807
...one!

267
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:15,707
Next then...

268
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:17,457
...two!

269
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:20,207
And Smol Ame, you're next.

270
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:24,057
He-yah!

271
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:27,157
And don't come back!

272
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:28,457
Ah.

273
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,557
I think we should head back to the office and celebrate.

274
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:32,707
Let's go!

275
00:18:57,257 --> 00:18:58,357
Yay!

276
00:18:58,607 --> 00:19:00,057
We did it! Case closed!

277
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:01,357
Hehehe.

278
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,507
Smol Ame, beat that!

279
00:19:03,607 --> 00:19:06,057
I'm sure she'll be back, she's like a cockroach.

280
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:07,507
I can't get rid of her.

281
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:09,157
Ah, well...

282
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,657
...now that we're here, back at the office...

283
00:19:12,857 --> 00:19:15,157
...I am expecting guests, like I said, so...

284
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:16,157
Uh...

285
00:19:16,457 --> 00:19:18,057
Maybe we should celebrate first.

286
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:18,957
How about that?

287
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:22,057
And then we'll have some guests, maybe?

288
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:22,807
Hmm.

289
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:24,457
I do have a treat for you guys.

290
00:19:24,557 --> 00:19:26,757
For being such good investigators.

291
00:19:27,257 --> 00:19:29,857
Ta-ta-ta-daa!

292
00:19:29,957 --> 00:19:30,557
Oof!

293
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:33,457
Oof! This thing is heavy!

294
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:34,457
Hehe.

295
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:36,207
Look at this!

296
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:37,557
Tada!

297
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:40,057
Whoa!

298
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:43,057
Whoa. There's a lot of liquid in here, huh?

299
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:45,407
At least two gallons.

300
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:47,357
Because there's so many of you guys in chat...

301
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:51,557
...we gotta get an appropriate amount to make sure it's effective, that is.

302
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,057
Isn't it cool? It's like a rocket launcher.

303
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:55,357
Like...

304
00:19:55,557 --> 00:19:58,557
Pew, pew, pew! Pew!

305
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:03,069
I like it.

306
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,569
Alright, well... you guys ready for your dose?

307
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:13,569
Wait, before we do this, do you guys have any dance requests for me?

308
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:17,069
Cause we're gonna have a little dance, dance-off sort of.

309
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:22,069
I wanna know if you guys have any dances that you want to see first before I give you this... injection.

310
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:25,069
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

311
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:26,569
The worm?

312
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:28,569
Alright, alright. Maybe I'll do a worm. Maybe.

313
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:30,069
Flossing?

314
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:34,069
Eh, flossing really? Okay, you know what? That's it.

315
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:36,269
Stab!

316
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:54,069
Hey, can you feel the effects yet? Huh?

317
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:01,869
Hey, do you guys recognize this song?

318
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:16,869
Alright, you guys asked for a floss, right? The floss.

319
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,869
I can't... I still can't floss. Shit!

320
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:30,569
If you guys recognize this song, you're a real one. A real one.

321
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:34,569
The worm. Okay, I'll do a worm like this. How about this?

322
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,569
Okay, a short worm, short worm.

323
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,569
Whoa, it doesn't really work with the triad.

324
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:55,569
Hey, come here. Oh...

325
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:00,569
Alright, snap out of it. We got guests coming. Come on!

326
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:09,569
Hey, did that help you guys snap out of it?

327
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:11,269
Come on, come on.

328
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:14,269
We have a guest now.

329
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,569
One guest for right now.

330
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:22,569
Let's see. Who could it be? Any... any guesses?

331
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:30,569
No? Maybe... now? Maybe?

332
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:33,569
Ah!

333
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:34,869
Hello!

334
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:36,569
コンカップー！
Kon-kapu!

335
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:41,069
My name is Genius Vampire, Yozora Mel!

336
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:44,069
Yay! Thank you for coming!

337
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:46,069
Thank you for Mel!
Thank you for having me!

338
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:47,569
I'm so happy you're here.

339
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:51,569
Yeah! Today we're going to play a game.

340
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:52,569
Yeah?

341
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:54,069
Yeah! What?

342
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:56,569
With... a ball!

343
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:58,069
A ball! Wah!

344
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:01,069
What game do you think?

345
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:02,569
Uh... let's go?

346
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:04,269
Maybe... baseball?

347
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:05,569
Baseball?

348
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:07,569
さっきやってたね。
We were doing that earlier.

349
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:10,569
Home run!

350
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:14,269
Home run!

351
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:17,069
No, we're not playing baseball. Maybe... soccer?

352
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:18,569
Soccer ball?

353
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:20,569
Yeah, should we play soccer?

354
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,569
Goal!

355
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:33,569
Okay, well... why don't we go see... 一緒に？
Okay, well... why don't we go see... together?

356
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:35,569
なになになに？
What, what, what?

357
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:37,569
Okay, we'll kick.

358
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:39,069
なんだこれ？
What is this?

359
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:41,569
Ready? Ready? せーの、よっ！
Ready? Ready? One, two... go!

360
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:46,069
Wah! なにこれ、なにこれ？
Wah! What's this, what's this?

361
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:48,569
It's Hopscotch!

362
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:51,569
Oh! ケンケンパ！
Oh! Ken Ken Pa!

363
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:53,569
ケンケンパ！ Yeah!
Ken Ken Pa! Yeah!

364
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:56,569
We're going to play Hopscotch.

365
00:23:56,869 --> 00:24:00,569
英語の名前は Hopscotch.
The English name is Hopscotch.

366
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:02,569
ホップスコッチ？ うん。
Hopscotch? Yeah.

367
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:04,569
But in Japan it's called Ken Ken Pa.

368
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:05,569
ケンケンパ！
Ken Ken Pa!

369
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:09,569
And every time you jump on one, you do... ケンケンパ！
And every time you jump on one, you do... Ken Ken Pa!

370
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:11,869
ケンケンパ！ ケンケンパ！
Ken Ken Pa! Ken Ken Pa!

371
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:14,569
So I'll explain the rule to you guys, but...
So I'll explain the rules to you guys, but...

372
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:17,569
Yeah, so this is how it works.

373
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:22,569
So you throw the ball and whichever square it lands on, you get the points for that square.

374
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:25,569
So we're going to try to throw it on like a high number.

375
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,569
But also, we only have five turns.

376
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:34,569
So whoever wins at the end of five turns that has most points will get a prize. Victory prize!
So whoever wins at the end of five turns with the most points will get a prize. A victory prize!

377
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:38,269
なるほど、説明しよう、日本語で。
I see. Let me explain in Japanese.

378
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:42,569
えー、今回はちょっと特殊なルールになっているみたいです。
Um, it seems like there are some special rules this time.

379
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:46,569
お互い5点を取るまでは... 投げられると。5回までか。
We throw until we each get 5 points... Oh, up to 5 times?

380
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:49,269
5回まで投げられますと。
We can throw up to five times.

381
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:53,269
そしてそして、数字のマスはそのまま得点になるので、
And, and, the numbered squares become your score just as they are,

382
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:57,569
えー、できるだけ多く取りたい人は、10のマスを目指してボールを投げる。
So, those who want as many points as possible should aim for the 10 square and throw.

383
00:25:00,393 --> 00:25:01,935
ことだ。イエーイ！
That's it. Yay!

384
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:05,018
そして、合計点数が多い方が勝ち！
And, the one with the higher total score wins!

385
00:25:05,226 --> 00:25:12,268
ケンケンパを失敗したり、特定の升からボールがはみ出したりしたら失敗！
If you fail the hopscotch or if the ball goes out of the specific square, it's a fail!

386
00:25:13,331 --> 00:25:16,372
はい。点数は加算されない、ということだね！
Yes. Points won't be added, that's what it is!

387
00:25:17,393 --> 00:25:20,539
イエーイ！落ち着け！イエーイ！よしよしよし
Yay! Calm down! Yay! Good, good, good.

388
00:25:20,747 --> 00:25:25,581
So because Mel is my senpai, Mel gets the first turn. イエーイ！
So because Mel is my senpai, Mel gets the first turn. Yay!

389
00:25:25,893 --> 00:25:27,831
よし！しょうがないな。
Alright! Can't be helped then.

390
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:31,497
ジーニアス・ヴァンパイアの力を見せてやろう。
Let me show you the power of a genius vampire.

391
00:25:31,622 --> 00:25:32,789
Let's see, let's see.

00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:37,539
では、第一球。行きます！なー！
Now, the first ball. Here I go! Naa!

マジか。マジか。
For real? For real?

395
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:48,456
So the rules are if you get it out, it goes to the next person's turn. So I guess it's my turn.

396
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:52,497
アメリア。へへへ。アメリア。ネクスト。オッケー。

00:45:04,789 --> 00:45:06,189
Jumping, jumping.

659
00:45:06,389 --> 00:45:07,609
I used to do this in the cave.

660
00:45:08,229 --> 00:45:10,149
My stamina is really bad.

661
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:11,729
Thank you.

662
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,329
It's punishment.

663
00:45:13,949 --> 00:45:16,369
Oh, I forgot to do the screenshot, oh no.

664
00:45:17,429 --> 00:45:19,109
Oh no, oh, you need one more, is that what you're saying?

665
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:20,789
All right, all right, you got it ready?

666
00:45:21,029 --> 00:45:22,509
Wait, more jumping jacks?

667
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:24,209
Yeah, yeah, I got this one.

668
00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:26,669
Hyah! Okay, hyah!

669
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:30,469
Did you really get it that fast?

670
00:45:30,949 --> 00:45:32,869
All right, next pose, Mumei.

671
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:38,349
Hmm, oh god, I gotta think about it.

672
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:44,369
How about you do the thinker pose again?

673
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:45,869
I asked you to do it last year.

674
00:45:45,989 --> 00:45:47,589
Thinker! Oh, that's right.

675
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:50,169
Yeah, I did this at the Bub-sen birthday.

676
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:52,609
Yes! Okay, uh.

677
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:55,909
I think I have to like, kneel. Oh wait, let me move over here a little bit.

678
00:45:57,369 --> 00:45:58,389
Oh, okay.

679
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:01,509
Deep thought.

680
00:46:02,029 --> 00:46:05,229
Oh, whoa, she looks so cool.

681
00:46:05,309 --> 00:46:06,729
Oh, she is super thinking.

682
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:12,729
Thinking so hard, that would be perfect. Super deep thinking thinker. Penny for your thoughts, ma'am?

683
00:46:15,669 --> 00:46:17,389
Um, you guys are cute.

684
00:46:17,469 --> 00:46:19,029
That's it, that's all I can think of right now.

685
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:22,049
I knew it.

686
00:46:23,129 --> 00:46:24,589
All right, next up, Ollie's pose.

687
00:46:25,689 --> 00:46:26,669
What would you like, ma'am?

688
00:46:28,649 --> 00:46:31,409
Well, uh, since Vet asked for jumping jacks...

689
00:46:31,529 --> 00:46:33,549
Can I ask for a, for a 20-second plank?

690
00:46:37,509 --> 00:46:40,529
A plank? Or, okay, not like the one where you have to hold for your abs...

691
00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:42,649
But like the one, the meme one, right?

692
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:46,049
The me— what does the meme one look like?

693
00:46:46,529 --> 00:46:48,489
It was like the, the— it was popular for a while.

694
00:46:48,689 --> 00:46:50,209
I'm gonna plank here.

695
00:46:50,609 --> 00:46:52,669
Yeah, in random spots.

696
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:55,829
The more random, the more likes you got.

697
00:46:56,369 --> 00:46:57,769
Oh, I want to see it.

698
00:46:58,429 --> 00:46:59,969
Okay, yeah, yeah, it's just this one.

699
00:47:00,789 --> 00:47:03,169
Wait, 20 seconds?

700
00:47:03,269 --> 00:47:05,229
I'm workin' mentally and physically here.

701
00:47:09,249 --> 00:47:11,129
Now do the worm!

702
00:47:12,909 --> 00:47:14,769
I look like a dead fish.

703
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:17,709
Has it been 20 seconds yet?

704
00:47:20,769 --> 00:47:22,189
I forgot to count.

705
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:24,149
We'll just say it was 20 seconds.

706
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:26,029
Good enough, phew!

707
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:28,309
Okay, thank you guys for the poses.

708
00:47:30,529 --> 00:47:32,609
Thank you for doing them. Oh yeah.

709
00:47:34,129 --> 00:47:36,269
You guys are such streamers.

710
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:41,349
All right, I'm so happy that you guys could be here with me.

711
00:47:41,469 --> 00:47:42,669
Thank you for coming.

712
00:47:43,209 --> 00:47:47,509
Thank you for inviting! Pleasure. You're so cute.

713
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:51,709
All right, you're cute! I'll see you guys again soon.

714
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:53,169
Okay, thank you.

715
00:47:53,669 --> 00:47:54,809
Yeah! All right.

716
00:47:54,929 --> 00:47:56,689
Mata ne, thank you!

717
00:47:57,009 --> 00:48:01,029
Okay, bye bye! Otsukaresama, bye bye!

718
00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:03,369
All right, next up we have...

719
00:48:03,749 --> 00:48:06,809
Um, let me check my bulletin board back there.

720
00:48:08,649 --> 00:48:10,149
Ah, that's right.

721
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:13,369
It's kind of a bit messy 'cause we had so many guests here...

722
00:48:13,569 --> 00:48:14,769
And we haven't cleaned in a while.

723
00:48:15,069 --> 00:48:16,969
I gotta get my vacuum cleaner.

724
00:48:17,049 --> 00:48:20,209
Yeah, that's right. 3D vacuum cleaner stream.

725
00:48:20,289 --> 00:48:21,969
Where is that vacuum cleaner?

726
00:48:24,029 --> 00:48:25,349
What's all this?

727
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:26,709
Bubba!

728
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:29,229
Ah, there's my vacuum cleaner.

729
00:48:29,669 --> 00:48:31,549
Right over there, Bubba.

730
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,469
Yeah, these treats are just incentives...

731
00:48:34,749 --> 00:48:36,689
For Bubba to clean the room.

732
00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:39,269
Just kidding, these are actually all of your guys's Super Chats.

733
00:48:39,509 --> 00:48:42,269
I saw like a bunch of rainbow in the preview, in the pre-chat.

734
00:48:42,709 --> 00:48:45,469
And, uh, yeah, I saw so many gifted memberships too.

735
00:48:45,549 --> 00:48:46,669
Thank you so much.

736
00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:50,309
As you can see, all of these Super Chats go straight into Bubba's belly.

737
00:48:50,709 --> 00:48:52,469
Bubba, wait Bubba, come back.

738
00:48:54,789 --> 00:48:55,829
Bubba.

739
00:48:57,789 --> 00:48:59,149
There he goes!

740
00:49:00,109 --> 00:49:03,389
Hah! Go! So Bubba's eating all of them.

741
00:49:03,549 --> 00:49:05,549
So thank you so much for all the support.

742
00:49:06,269 --> 00:49:07,909
This is a Super Chat.

743
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:10,189
That one's a Super Chat.

744
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:12,549
And that one's a Super Chat.

745
00:49:15,149 --> 00:49:17,509
All right, well, now we have some time...

746
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:20,829
While Bubba cleans up all of these bones...

747
00:49:20,909 --> 00:49:25,549
Now we have some time for pose requests and stuff, yeah, from you guys, from chat.

748
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:29,229
Because I can see the chat.

749
00:49:29,989 --> 00:49:32,589
And I wanted to know if there's anything that you guys want to see in 3D...

750
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:35,469
Since I'm only here, it's only possible because you guys made it possible.

751
00:49:35,549 --> 00:49:37,509
Yeah! All of your support over the last few years...

752
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:42,669
Isn't that weird to say?

753
00:49:43,269 --> 00:49:44,949
Splits? Kabe-don?

754
00:49:49,269 --> 00:49:51,469
Oh, wait, what do you usually say in a Kabe-don?

755
00:49:52,109 --> 00:49:53,749
Oh, you come around here often?

756
00:49:54,789 --> 00:49:56,389
I don't know. Okay, okay.

757
00:49:58,389 --> 00:49:59,909
A cartwheel? Oh, I knew you guys...

758
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:01,179
Doesn't hurt to ask.

759
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:02,641
I mean, we have to compare, right?

760
00:50:02,641 --> 00:50:03,552
We have to be able to compare.

761
00:50:03,552 --> 00:50:04,745
Alright, hopefully I don't mess this up.

762
00:50:04,745 --> 00:50:06,116
I didn't do a cartwheel today.

763
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:07,552
Not even during rehearsal or anything.

764
00:50:07,552 --> 00:50:08,711
I was like, "I'm gonna save it."

765
00:50:08,711 --> 00:50:09,258
Okay.

766
00:50:09,258 --> 00:50:10,168
Wait, I gotta warm up.

767
00:50:12,778 --> 00:50:13,252
Okay.

768
00:50:13,252 --> 00:50:14,219
Wheee!

769
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:16,636
Kyah!

770
00:50:16,636 --> 00:50:17,580
Yeah, we did it!

771
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,608
A cartwheel's just a side flip, okay?

772
00:50:19,608 --> 00:50:21,082
Just so you guys know, it's like a sideways flip pretty much.

773
00:50:21,082 --> 00:50:21,982
I think.

774
00:50:21,982 --> 00:50:23,277
Nice, nice.

775
00:50:23,277 --> 00:50:24,609
Okay, okay. Any other requests you guys have for me?

776
00:50:24,609 --> 00:50:26,296
We have some time, so I think we're good.

777
00:50:26,296 --> 00:50:27,388
Sorry, my nose is itchy.

778
00:50:27,388 --> 00:50:28,609
The worm? I already did the worm!

779
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,761
My pants? No!

780
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:31,439
You guys have seen them enough times already.

781
00:50:31,439 --> 00:50:32,547
Crab? Okay, I can do crab.

782
00:50:32,547 --> 00:50:33,576
Akani.
Crab.

783
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:36,670
This is kind of like a crab.

784
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:37,528
A JoJo pose.

785
00:50:37,528 --> 00:50:40,993
I mean, some random pose from some generic thing.

786
00:50:40,993 --> 00:50:42,734
Wait, what do they usually do? Like this?

787
00:50:44,345 --> 00:50:45,452
I don't know what to do with my hands.

788
00:50:45,452 --> 00:50:46,547
T-pose. Okay, okay.

789
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:47,519
Whoa, T-pose.

790
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:48,988
Ame helicopter!

791
00:50:50,263 --> 00:50:52,682
Oh, Jack-O pose. Wait, how does that go again?

792
00:50:54,815 --> 00:50:56,267
Is this right? Is it something like this? I don't remember, actually.

793
00:50:56,267 --> 00:50:57,311
Something like that.

794
00:50:57,311 --> 00:50:58,254
A ground pound.

795
00:50:58,254 --> 00:50:59,528
I don't think I can do that on this floor.

796
00:50:59,528 --> 00:51:00,812
I could do like a...

797
00:51:00,812 --> 00:51:01,902
A ground pound squat, kind of.

798
00:51:01,902 --> 00:51:02,976
It seems close enough.

799
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,092
A bridge? Oh, isn't that like where you go back?

800
00:51:04,092 --> 00:51:05,559
I feel like I'm gonna mess up something if I do that.

801
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:06,153
Oh well.

802
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:08,713
They said no. No bridge.

803
00:51:08,713 --> 00:51:09,787
Okay, something else?

804
00:51:09,787 --> 00:51:11,374
How about you guys pose? 'Cause I'm sure your gamer posture's messed up.

805
00:51:11,374 --> 00:51:12,496
Posture check!

806
00:51:12,496 --> 00:51:13,682
Gamer stretches, let's go.

807
00:51:13,682 --> 00:51:14,777
Do you guys stretch today?

808
00:51:14,777 --> 00:51:16,179
Do you know how important stretching is for your limbs?

809
00:51:16,179 --> 00:51:17,654
You guys just sit and watch streams all day. You don't stretch.

810
00:51:17,654 --> 00:51:19,184
Your neck's probably like...

811
00:51:19,184 --> 00:51:19,710
Like that.

812
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:20,734
Okay, check, posture check.

813
00:51:20,734 --> 00:51:21,988
Oh yeah, I discovered this when we were practicing. Look.

814
00:51:21,988 --> 00:51:22,724
Wait.

815
00:51:22,724 --> 00:51:23,777
What did I do?

816
00:51:23,777 --> 00:51:24,559
I look like a bird.

817
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:25,892
Caw! Caw! Oh, I know you guys are gonna ask.

818
00:51:25,892 --> 00:51:27,130
But this does not come off.

819
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:28,328
The cape always stays on, okay?

820
00:51:28,328 --> 00:51:29,496
It always stays on.

821
00:51:29,496 --> 00:51:30,483
The coat always stays on.

822
00:51:30,483 --> 00:51:31,252
I look like a lizard. Oh yeah.

823
00:51:31,252 --> 00:51:33,595
Ow, my elbow cracked. Whew.

824
00:51:33,595 --> 00:51:34,482
Feels nice.

825
00:51:34,482 --> 00:51:35,179
Nerfed!

826
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:36,670
Okay, what else?

827
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:38,345
Do you guys have any other poses for me? This is your last chance.

828
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,609
Last chance!

829
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:40,559
A dab. Oh, of course.

830
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:41,528
How could I forget?

831
00:51:41,528 --> 00:51:42,654
I'll do a really epic one.

832
00:51:42,654 --> 00:51:43,856
Did it work?

833
00:51:46,547 --> 00:51:47,609
Not singing any song in particular.

834
00:51:48,653 --> 00:51:50,184
I can't do a backflip, okay? Don't ask.

835
00:51:50,184 --> 00:51:51,469
Maybe if I was on a trampoline.

836
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:52,682
I used to be able to do one on a...

837
00:51:52,682 --> 00:51:53,834
We gotta get a trampoline here, staff, okay?

838
00:51:53,834 --> 00:51:55,345
In my office, yes, I need a trampoline.

839
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:56,382
It has so many hidden features though.

840
00:51:56,382 --> 00:51:57,024
You guys probably don't even know.

841
00:51:57,024 --> 00:51:58,082
Not yet, anyways.

842
00:51:58,082 --> 00:51:58,882
Moonwalk.

843
00:51:58,882 --> 00:51:58,991
I can try.

844
00:52:00,795 --> 00:52:02,469
I actually don't really know how to do it, how to moonwalk properly.

845
00:52:02,469 --> 00:52:03,609
What is... can you guys... what is the Griddy? Can you guys teach me?

846
00:52:03,609 --> 00:52:04,896
I feel like I've seen it, but...

847
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:06,153
Maybe I just time traveled too much, you know? I don't know it properly.

848
00:52:06,153 --> 00:52:07,559
Wait, no, this is...

849
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:08,892
This is the sprinkler, like the...

850
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:11,223
Shopping cart, beep, beep, beep, beep.

851
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:14,184
Macarena.

852
00:52:14,184 --> 00:52:15,496
Hey, Macarena!

853
00:52:15,496 --> 00:52:16,961
Isn't... don't you do a slap during that? I didn't sing anything.

854
00:52:16,961 --> 00:52:17,795
There was no song there.

855
00:52:17,795 --> 00:52:19,130
Oh, this one.

856
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,388
How do you do this again?

857
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:21,179
Stupid.

858
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,130
Ah, Idol Step.

859
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:23,153
Wait, how do you do it again? Oh, I'm an idol.

860
00:52:23,153 --> 00:52:24,328
I can do it.

861
00:52:24,328 --> 00:52:25,734
Skiing dance.

862
00:52:25,734 --> 00:52:26,682
Alright.

863
00:52:26,682 --> 00:52:27,896
Now...

864
00:55:00,278 --> 00:55:02,303
Pose, what'd you do for the last one?

865
00:55:02,553 --> 00:55:04,603
Skanking! If you guys don't know what skanking is...

866
00:55:04,603 --> 00:55:07,953
...it's a specific dance where you go like this.

867
00:55:16,603 --> 00:55:20,403
Alright! That was the last pose, so I've been told.

868
00:55:21,053 --> 00:55:22,653
Alright!

869
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:26,453
Now it's time for... announcements!

870
00:55:26,653 --> 00:55:28,403
I can't believe how fast the time went.

871
00:55:28,403 --> 00:55:32,553
Alright, let's go! Announcements! Yeah!

872
00:55:36,653 --> 00:55:41,403
Alright! As you guys know, always at the end of these things, there's an announcement.

873
00:55:43,203 --> 00:55:47,503
Hmm... What could it be? I wonder. Hehe.

874
00:55:48,503 --> 00:55:52,603
Uh... could it be something in this room? Like a really cool box?

875
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:57,303
Or that cool vase over there that doesn't hold anything weird in it?

876
00:55:57,603 --> 00:56:02,303
Or... uh... yeah, I actually don't know.

877
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:04,403
Why don't we take a look at the image! Yata!

878
00:56:04,803 --> 00:56:08,503
Whoa! Ame hat!

879
00:56:09,103 --> 00:56:11,603
That's right, you too can become a detective!

880
00:56:11,603 --> 00:56:14,603
And actually, this picture makes it look super like a hexagon,

881
00:56:14,603 --> 00:56:16,503
but it doesn't look like that when you wear it, okay?

882
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:21,003
It's very cool and round, and it looks just like my hat. And it's very cool.

883
00:56:21,303 --> 00:56:23,603
You guys... I want you to see it, so...

884
00:56:23,603 --> 00:56:26,003
...you know, if you want to, you can get one,

885
00:56:26,003 --> 00:56:30,503
and it will be on sale tomorrow during all of Myth's items sales.

886
00:56:30,703 --> 00:56:34,503
Yeah, it looks really, really cool. And it's adjustable in the back.

887
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:37,503
And also, the ribbon comes off.

888
00:56:37,503 --> 00:56:42,003
So, you know, if you're a cool macho man and you don't want to be a cute anime girl,

889
00:56:42,003 --> 00:56:46,003
you can just... and it comes off.

890
00:56:48,603 --> 00:56:52,503
So much excitement! And I still have something else in store.

891
00:56:52,503 --> 00:56:57,003
Something else, soon! But as I said... so yeah, you can buy it now...

892
00:56:57,503 --> 00:57:00,003
...not now, tomorrow, it'll go on sale.

893
00:57:00,203 --> 00:57:05,303
And I have a—I have one actually, I mean obviously, I have one myself.

894
00:57:05,603 --> 00:57:08,503
But uh... I have one and people have been trying it on,

895
00:57:08,503 --> 00:57:10,603
and they're like, "Oh my god, this is so cute!"

896
00:57:10,603 --> 00:57:16,603
Like IRyS tried it on, and Zeta tried it on, and Ina tried it on, and yeah, it's super cute.

897
00:57:16,703 --> 00:57:20,303
So if you guys are interested, you can buy it. Yeah, it's right here.

898
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:24,403
You know, this is my model for today. You can get... this could be you.

899
00:57:24,603 --> 00:57:30,003
But you'll look way cooler wearing it, I promise. Okay, not I promise. But... um...

900
00:57:31,103 --> 00:57:34,503
Yeah, we still have... we still have some stuff left, huh?

901
00:57:34,503 --> 00:57:37,503
We still have some time left. A little bit of time.

902
00:57:37,603 --> 00:57:40,003
Alright. Shoo, shoo! Go away.

903
00:57:43,103 --> 00:57:45,503
Oh yeah, I just wanted to thank you guys also.

904
00:57:46,203 --> 00:57:49,103
Make sure to check out our group collab stream tomorrow.

905
00:57:49,203 --> 00:57:53,203
It will be live, and we're all going to be there, all five of Myth.

906
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:57,103
And we have some cool stuff to show you and it's going to be really, really fun.

907
00:57:57,203 --> 00:58:02,403
I'm actually really looking forward to it because... you know, just being together is really fun in general.

908
00:58:02,603 --> 00:58:07,603
And yeah, I'm really happy. It's super weird that I got to be here in Japan doing this.

909
00:58:07,603 --> 00:58:10,503
You know, where I am. So it's super cool.

910
00:58:10,603 --> 00:58:16,303
I used to just be somebody that would do like... you know, really terrible, bad VR stuff.

911
00:58:16,303 --> 00:58:20,003
Sometimes in public, even at an internet cafe once.

912
00:58:20,203 --> 00:58:24,003
And now I get to do it in front of professional staff.

913
00:58:24,203 --> 00:58:28,003
So it's pretty crazy to think about. And I hope that one day...

914
00:58:28,203 --> 00:58:33,603
...you know, even if you don't have the same experience, that you guys get to experience something just as fulfilling.

915
00:58:33,603 --> 00:58:36,003
Because I feel really happy to be here. Yeah.

916
00:58:36,103 --> 00:58:38,103
I'm not gonna cry. I'm not gonna cry.

917
00:58:38,203 --> 00:58:42,503
But yeah, I'm super happy, so thank you, thank you for making it possible to be here.

918
00:58:42,703 --> 00:58:46,603
And... uh... there is one last thing that I want to show you guys, okay?

919
00:58:47,203 --> 00:58:51,003
And share my happiness with you a little bit too. Okay.

920
00:58:51,203 --> 00:58:55,003
Shall we see what it is? Okay, I'm going now.

921
00:58:56,403 --> 00:59:00,003
What's this surprise? Surprise!
