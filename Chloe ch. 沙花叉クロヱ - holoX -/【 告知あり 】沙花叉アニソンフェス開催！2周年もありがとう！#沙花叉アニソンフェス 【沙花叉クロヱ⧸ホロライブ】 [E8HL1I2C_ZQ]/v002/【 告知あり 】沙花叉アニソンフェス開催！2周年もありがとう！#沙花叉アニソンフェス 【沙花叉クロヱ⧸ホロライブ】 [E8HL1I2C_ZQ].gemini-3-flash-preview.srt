いっちょやって　まだいっちょ
Do it once, then once more

31
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:45,033
ぶっちゃけありえない
To be honest, it's impossible

32

笑う門に福来るでしょ
Good fortune comes to those who laugh, right?

40
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:15,533
ネガティブだってブッ飛ぶ
Even negativity will fly away

41

命の華
The flower of life

42
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:21,033

おしゃべり　ベリーたい
Want to chat-chat so much

49
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:44,833
噂は恋する乙女の
Rumors are like vitamins

50
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:47,533
ビタミン剤だもん
For a girl in love

51
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:53,633
闇夜に浮かんだ虹の架け橋
A rainbow bridge floating in the dark night

52

ここに降りて　奇跡
Come down here, it's a miracle

必殺技でハートキュン！
A special move to make your heart throb!

58
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,833
瞳に星
With stars in your eyes

59
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,233
映して　思い切り
Reflecting them with all your might

60
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:19,233

More and more sparkling

舵向きわかんない
I don't know which way the rudder points

68
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,433
今しかできない宿題
Homework that can only be done now

The opening of carelessness, if very very measured

146
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:10,145
ワン！ワン！ワン！
One! One! One!

147
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:12,945
計られちゃったら　物惜しげにじわじわ　ジク膨らんだなら
If it's measured, and it swells up bit by bit reluctantly

148
00:13:12,945 --> 00:13:13,445
ワン！ワン！ワン！
One! One! One!

149
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:14,645
走り出しましょう
Let's start running

150
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:20,045
ウィンク飛ばしましょう
Let's blow a wink

151
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:37,045
Someone else! Someone else! Someone else! Someone else!

152
00:13:38,045 --> 00:13:41,045
イェーイ！
Yeah!

153
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:58,045
The Everlasting Guilty Crown

154
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:10,545
あぁ... 世界は終わりを告げようとしている
Ah... the world is about to meet its end

155
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:19,545
誰にも止められはしない
No one can stop it

156
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:33,545
始まる崩壊のシンフォニーが鳴り響いて
The symphony of beginning collapse resounds

157
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:42,045
降る雨はまるで涙の音色
The falling rain is like the sound of tears

158
00:14:42,545 --> 00:14:44,245
あぁ　教えて
Ah, tell me

159
00:14:44,745 --> 00:14:49,845
支配し支配され人たちは
People who rule and are ruled over...

160
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:55,245
いつかその心に憎しみを
...will they one day have hatred in their hearts...

161
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:59,045
そして愛することも...
...and even loving...

162
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:02,097
自由を あらわす
Expressing freedom

163
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:06,657
その
That

164
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:09,897
この歌が聴こえてる
You can hear this song

165
00:15:09,897 --> 00:15:12,977
命あるすべてのものよ
All living things

166
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:16,937
真実はあなたの胸の中にある
The truth is within your heart

167
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:20,977
嵐の海を行く時も
Even when crossing stormy seas

168
00:15:20,977 --> 00:15:25,937
決して屈することのない強さを
A strength that never gives in

169
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:32,497
くれるから
Because it gives me that

170
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:59,137
けれども進むほど風は強い
But the further I go, the stronger the wind

171
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:10,577
希望の光はやがて消えていく
The light of hope will eventually fade

172
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:19,017
「よこせ」と奪い合い 果てに人は
People fight and snatch, and in the end,

173
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:30,257
殺し合う 涙さえ枯れ果てて
Kill each other, until even tears dry up

174
00:16:36,777 --> 00:16:41,657
気付いて その目は互いを認めるため
Realize, those eyes are for recognizing each other

175
00:16:42,097 --> 00:16:47,137
その声は想いを伝えるため
That voice is for conveying feelings

176
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:55,817
その手は大事な人とつなぐためにある
Those hands are for holding onto loved ones

177
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:01,497
この歌が聴こえてる
You can hear this song

178
00:17:01,497 --> 00:17:04,657
世界中の夜標のものよ
O guides of the night across the world

179
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:09,137
希望はあなたの胸の中にある
Hope is within your heart

180
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:12,777
燃え盛る炎の中でも
Even amidst the blazing flames

181
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:17,737
決して傷つくことのない強さを
A strength that will never be hurt

182
00:17:19,937 --> 00:17:24,537
くれるから
Because it gives me that

183
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:37,457
その手で守ろうとしたものは
Was what you tried to protect with those hands

184
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:41,417
愛するものだったのだろうか
Something that you loved?

185
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,217
赤く染まったその手を眺めて
Looking at those blood-stained hands

186
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:46,297
やっと自覚してきた重さを
The weight you finally realized

187
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:48,857
過ちと認めるその罪を
The sin of admitting it as a mistake

188
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:54,657
止めどなく溢れるその涙を知る
Knowing those tears that overflow endlessly

189
00:17:56,937 --> 00:17:59,497
この歌が聴こえてる
You can hear this song

190
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:02,617
命あるすべてのものよ
All living things

191
00:18:03,497 --> 00:18:08,457
真実はあなたの胸の中にある
The truth is within your heart

192
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:11,257
嵐の海は静まった
The stormy sea has calmed

193
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:16,537
失ったものは数えきれなくとも
Even if what was lost is beyond count

194
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:22,977
この歌が聴こえてる
You can hear this song

195
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:26,177
世界中の夜標のものよ
O guides of the night across the world

196
00:18:27,177 --> 00:18:30,617
希望はあなたの胸の中にある
Hope is within your heart

197
00:18:30,617 --> 00:18:34,137
悲しみの夜を越える時
When crossing the night of sorrow

198
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:39,217
必ずあなたが生きていく強さを
The strength to surely keep on living

199
00:18:41,657 --> 00:18:46,457
持ってるから
Because you have it within you

200
00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:55,377
超天変地異みたいな狂騒にも慣れて
Getting used to an uproar like a catastrophe

201
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:59,057
こんな日常を平和と見間違う
Mistaking this daily life for peace

202
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:03,569
狂っておちてコースター 揺さぶられながら
Going crazy and falling off the coaster while being shaken

203
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,569
見失えないものは何だ？
What is it that I cannot lose sight of?

204
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:10,569
平等性原理主義の概念に呑まれて
Swallowed by the concept of egalitarian fundamentalism

205
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:13,869
心までがまるでエトセトラ
Even my heart is just an "et cetera"

206
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:17,569
大嫌い 大好き ちゃんと喋らなきゃ
Hate it, love it, I've got to speak up properly

207
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:20,569
人形とさして変わらないし
Otherwise I'm not much different from a doll

208
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:25,069
あぁ 宵街を行く人だかりは
Ah, the crowds moving through the evening streets

209
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:28,569
嬉しそうだったり 寂しそうだったり
Look happy, look lonely

210
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:32,069
コントラストが五線を飛びまわり
The contrast flies around the staff

211
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:35,569
歌とリズムになる
Becoming song and rhythm

212
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,869
ママレード＆シュガーソング、ピーナッツ＆ビターステップ
Marmalade & Sugar Song, Peanuts & Bitter Step

213
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:43,369
甘くて苦くて目が回りそうです
It's sweet and bitter, it makes my head spin

214
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:46,869
南南西を目指してパーティを続けよう
Let's head south-southwest and keep the party going

215
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:50,369
世界中を驚かせてしまう夜になる
It'll be a night that surprises the whole world

216
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:53,869
I feel 上々 連鎖になってリフレクト
I feel great, becoming a chain and reflecting

217
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:05,369
蓋然性合理主義の正義に呑まれて
Swallowed by the justice of probabilistic rationalism

218
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:08,569
僕らの音楽は道具になりさがる
Our music degenerates into a tool

219
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:12,069
こっちを向いてよ 背を向けないでよ
Look this way, don't turn your back on me

220
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:15,369
それは正論にならないけど
That doesn't make it the right thing to say

221
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:19,869
祭囃子のその後で 高ぶったままの人
After the festival music, those who are still excited

222
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:23,069
泣き出し出してしまう人
Those who burst into tears

223
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:26,569
多分同じだけど 言葉にしようものなら
They're probably the same, but if I were to put it into words

224
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:29,869
稚拙なものばかり
It would be nothing but childish things

225
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:34,369
最高だってシュガーソング、幸せってビターステップ
Sugar Song is the best, Bitter Step is happiness

226
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:37,869
死ねない理由をそこに映し出せ
Reflect the reason you can't die right there

227
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:41,369
惜しがったって等速で明日は来ちゃうけど
Even if you regret it, tomorrow will come at the same speed

228
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:44,869
脳内天国お花畑のアップデートを果たしたのなら
If you've updated the flower garden in your head

229
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:30,569
someday 狂騒が息を潜めても
Someday, even if the frenzy catches its breath

230
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:34,569
someday 正論に意味がなくなっても
Someday, even if the right argument loses its meaning

231
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:38,069
feeling 探すまで 鳴らし続けることだけが
Feeling, until we find it, just continuing to ring

232
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:43,569
僕たちを僕たちたらしめる証明になる Q.E.D.
Will be the proof that makes us who we are. Q.E.D.

233
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:48,369
ママレード＆シュガーソング、ピーナッツ＆ビターステップ
Marmalade & Sugar Song, Peanuts & Bitter Step

234
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:51,869
生きてく理由をそこに映し出せ
Reflect the reason you live right there

235
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:55,369
北北東は後退り その距離が誇らしい
Backing away from the north-northeast, proud of that distance

236
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:59,069
世界中を驚かせ続けよう
Let's keep surprising the whole world

237
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:02,569
ママレード＆シュガーソング、ピーナッツ＆ビターステップ
Marmalade & Sugar Song, Peanuts & Bitter Step

238
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:06,069
甘くて苦くて目が回りそうです
It's sweet and bitter, it makes my head spin

239
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:09,569
南南西を目指してパーティを続けよう
Let's head south-southwest and keep the party going

240
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:13,069
世界中を驚かせてしまう夜になる
It'll be a night that surprises the whole world

241
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:16,569
I feel 上々 連鎖になってリフレクト
I feel great, becoming a chain and reflecting

242
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:21,069
Goes on 一回だって、いつだって、また一興
Goes on, even once, anytime, it's a blast again

243
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:29,569
一回だって、いつだって、また一興
Even once, anytime, it's a blast again

244
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:34,569
nananana... you got the heart base in the melody

245
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:56,569
この瞳は 鮮やかに 今 君しか映さない
These eyes clearly reflect only you now

246
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:01,369
踏み込んで目覚める 世界へ
Stepping into the awakening world

247
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:06,069
Chase the world

248
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:12,569
俯きすぎて 小さい地平
Looking down too much, a small horizon

249
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:17,569
僕だけの景色が
The scenery only for me

250
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:23,069
組み立てたジオラマの 嘘だと
As a lie of the assembled diorama

251
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:29,069
合わせづらい視点に 気づいている
I'm aware of the point of view that's hard to align

252
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:34,569
描き出して行く未来を 美しさを
The future that I'm drawing out, the beauty

253
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:40,569
手に
In my hands

254
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:45,569
それぞれが飛べる場所を 追いかけていく
Chasing the places where each can fly

255
00:24:52,069 --> 00:24:57,069
この瞳は 鮮やかに 今 君しか映さない
These eyes clearly reflect only you now

256
00:24:57,569 --> 00:25:01,569
加速して初めて
Only after accelerating

257
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,381
…行ける僕は　僕の叫べ
...I can go, my cry

258
00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:05,381
もっと高く　もっと強く
Higher, stronger

259
00:25:05,581 --> 00:25:08,381
君に届けたい
I want to reach you

260
00:25:08,581 --> 00:25:12,381
踏み込んで目覚める
Step in and wake up

261
00:25:12,581 --> 00:25:15,581
Chase the world!

262
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:21,081
万言も混ざり続けて
Countless words keep mixing together

263
00:25:21,581 --> 00:25:25,081
擦り切れてしまった
They've worn out

264
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:30,381
諦めてしまえという
A voice telling me to give up

265
00:25:30,581 --> 00:25:32,881
もしや
Perhaps...

266
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:38,081
屈服させた壁を壊したがってる
...it wants to break the walls that made me yield

267
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:42,581
ひたむきに祈る声も
Even the voice praying earnestly

268
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:48,081
闇に笑われる夜に
In the night laughed at by darkness

269
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:53,581
叶わない戯言さと
Calling it impossible nonsense

270
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:57,081
潜ませても
Even if I hide it

271
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:03,581
この翼で　誰よりも
With these wings, more than anyone

272
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:06,581
はるか羽ばたく
I'll fly far away

273
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:09,581
抑えない鼓動が
If this uncontrollable heartbeat

274
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:12,581
運命を急がせるのなら
Makes destiny rush forward

275
00:26:13,081 --> 00:26:15,581
願う前に　戻る前に
Before wishing, before returning

276
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:18,281
君を抱きしめて
I'll hold you close

277
00:26:18,581 --> 00:26:21,281
彼方へと飛び立つ
And take flight to the other side

278
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:25,081
Changing your world!

279
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:50,381
この瞳は　鮮やかに舞う
These eyes vividly witness

280
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:53,381
君しか知らない
Only you, who dances through them

281
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:56,381
加速して初めて
Only by accelerating

282
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:59,381
行ける僕は　僕の叫べ
Can I go, hear my cry

283
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:02,381
この翼で　誰よりも
With these wings, more than anyone

284
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:05,381
はるか羽ばたく
I'll fly far away

285
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:08,381
抑えない鼓動が
If this uncontrollable heartbeat

286
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:11,381
運命を急がせるのなら
Makes destiny rush forward

287
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:13,881
もっと高く　もっと強く
Higher, stronger

288
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:16,881
君に届けたい
I want to reach you

289
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:20,381
踏み込んで目覚める
Step in and wake up

290
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:25,081
世界へ！
To the world!

291
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:40,081
May'nさん、来てください本当にありがとうございます！
May'n-san, thank you so much for coming!

292
00:27:40,081 --> 00:27:44,281
ありがとうございます。2周年おめでとうございます！
Thank you. Congratulations on your 2nd anniversary!

293
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:50,181
ありがとうございます。もう、嬉しすぎて、ちょっと、歌が、本当に上手すぎて。
Thank you. I'm just so happy... and your singing was just too good.

294
00:27:50,181 --> 00:27:55,881
めちゃめちゃびっくりしまして、本当に。みんなびっくりしてます、今。
I was so surprised, really. Everyone is surprised right now.

295
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:58,581
嬉しいです。でもこうやってご一緒させてもらえて。
I'm glad. To be able to perform together like this...

296
00:27:58,581 --> 00:28:00,081
いやもう緊張しました。
I was so nervous.

297
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:06,081
だって、色んな、例えば「ライオン」とか「射手座」とかも歌っていただいてましたもんね、以前。
Because you've covered various songs like "Lion" and "Iteza" before, right?

298
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:08,881
あ、そんな、バレてるんですね！
Oh, you noticed that!

299
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:13,981
なんか「ライオン」はもともと私お二人で歌わせてもらってる楽曲なので。
Since "Lion" is originally a song I sing as a duo...

300
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:19,481
お一人で、あんなにまた違う風に歌えるなんてと思って、すごい嬉しく思ってます。
I was really happy to see you sing it alone in such a different way.

301
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:22,281
嬉しい！こちらこそ、本当にありがとうございます。
I'm so happy! Thank you so much as well.

302
00:28:22,281 --> 00:28:26,181
え、VTuberコラボが初めてってお伺いしたんですけど。
I heard this is your first VTuber collaboration?

303
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:31,081
あ、そうなんです。なので、こうやって、あと自分の楽曲を他の方がカバーしてくださって、
Yes, it is. So, having someone else cover my song...

304
00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:38,281
で、一緒に歌うっていう経験も、実はアーティスト同士のコラボも少なくて、自分の曲だと。
and then singing it together... actually, even with other artists, I don't do that often with my own songs.

305
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:39,481
あ、そうなんですか。
Oh, really?

306
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:45,381
なので、今回かなり、VTuberの方とのコラボっていう意味でも、めちゃめちゃ特別ですし。
So this time, in terms of collaborating with a VTuber, it's very special.

307
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:48,381
本当に「初めて」がたくさん詰まったコラボでした。
It was a collaboration filled with many "firsts."

308
00:28:48,381 --> 00:28:51,981
やったー！嬉しいです、ありがとうございます。
Yay! I'm so happy, thank you.

309
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:55,381
なんかめちゃめちゃ本当に緊張してて。
I was really, really nervous.

310
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:59,281
なんか、ご挨拶に行く時とかも、「どうしよう、どうしよう」と思ってて。
When I went to greet you, I was thinking "What should I do, what should I do?"

311
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:03,281
ちょっと失礼がないように行かなきゃと思って。
I thought I had to go without being rude.

312
00:29:03,281 --> 00:29:09,181
で、ちょっとメイク中ってお伺いしたんで、ガチャって開けたら、May'nさんがメイクまだされてる最中で。
And I heard you were in the middle of makeup, so when I opened the door, May'n-san was still being made up.

313
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:12,381
で、その時に「May'nがメインじゃない時なんですけど」って言ってて。
And then you said, "It's a time when May'n isn't 'main' (complete) yet."

314
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:19,881
めっちゃ… まだなんか化粧水のあとの乳液の段階だったんで、ベトベトの、ベトベトのメインになる前みたいな状態で。
I was... just at the stage of moisturizer after toner, so it was like sticky, sticky pre-main state.

315
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:22,981
いや、もうそんなの、気にならないぐらい本当に…
Oh, it didn't bother me at all, really...

316
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:27,481
いや本当に、で、めっちゃそれで気さくな方で、マジで安心しました。
No really, you were so friendly, I was truly relieved.

317
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:29,181
嬉しいです。ありがとうございます。
I'm glad. Thank you.

318
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:32,281
本当にありがとうございます。今日は楽しんでいただけましたでしょうか。
Thank you so much. Did you enjoy yourself today?

319
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:36,081
あ、すごい楽しかったです。ぜひまた今度コラボさせてください。
Oh, it was a lot of fun. Please let me collaborate with you again sometime.

320
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:39,581
ぜひともよろしくお願いします！ありがとうございます。
By all means, please! Thank you.

321
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:44,281
ではまだまだライブは続きますので、皆さんよろしくお願いします。
Well, the live show continues, so everyone, please enjoy.

322
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:47,881
ありがとうございます。皆さん、まだまだ楽しんでいってください。
Thank you. Everyone, please keep having fun.

323
00:29:47,881 --> 00:29:50,081
2周年本当におめでとうございました。
Congratulations again on your 2nd anniversary.

324
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:52,581
本当にありがとうございましたー！バイバーイ！
Thank you so much! Bye-bye!

325
00:30:06,593 --> 00:30:15,093
only my railgun

326
00:30:17,543 --> 00:30:21,393
放て 心に刻んだ夢を
Release the dream etched in your heart,

327
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:25,243
未来さえも置き去りにして
leaving even the future behind.

328
00:30:25,243 --> 00:30:28,993
限界など知らない 意味ない
I know no limits, they're meaningless.

329
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,543
この力が光散らす
This power scatters light.

330
00:30:32,543 --> 00:30:37,093
その先に遥かな想いを
Beyond that, far-reaching thoughts.

331
00:30:39,493 --> 00:30:46,093
歩いてきたこの道を振り返ることしかできないなら
If I can only look back at this path I've walked,

332
00:30:47,843 --> 00:30:52,093
今ここで全てを壊せる
I can destroy everything right here, right now.

333
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:56,393
暗闇に落ちる街並み
The streets falling into darkness,

334
00:30:56,393 --> 00:31:00,143
人はどこまで立ち向かえるの
how far can people stand up to it?

335
00:31:00,143 --> 00:31:03,893
加速するその痛みから
From that accelerating pain,

336
00:31:03,893 --> 00:31:07,243
誰かをきっと守れるよ
I'm sure I can protect someone.

337
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:11,043
Looking the blitz loop this planet to search a way

338
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:14,743
Only my railgun can shoot it 今すぐ
Only my railgun can shoot it, right now.

339
00:31:14,743 --> 00:31:18,493
身体中を光の速さで
At the speed of light through my whole body,

340
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:21,243
駆け巡った 確かな予感
a certain premonition coursed through.

341
00:31:21,243 --> 00:31:25,093
掴め！ 望むものなら残さず
Seize it! If it's what you desire, leave nothing behind,

342
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:29,043
輝ける自分らしさで
shining with your own identity.

343
00:31:29,893 --> 00:31:33,793
信じてるよ あの日の誓いを
I believe in the oath of that day.

344
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:35,943
この瞳に光る涙
Even the tears shining in these eyes,

345
00:31:35,943 --> 00:31:39,393
それさえも強さになるから
even they will become strength.

346
00:31:41,543 --> 00:31:44,893
立ち止まると少しだけ
When I stop, I feel a little bit

347
00:31:44,893 --> 00:31:48,443
感じる切なさに
of sadness.

348
00:31:48,443 --> 00:31:54,093
戸惑うことないなんて嘘はつかないよ
I won't lie and say I'm never bewildered.

349
00:31:54,493 --> 00:31:58,293
空に舞うコインが描く
The parabola drawn by the coin

350
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:01,443
放物線が決める運命
dancing in the sky decides fate.

351
00:32:01,443 --> 00:32:05,243
打ち出した答えが今日も
The answer I've struck out courses

352
00:32:05,243 --> 00:32:09,243
私の胸を駆け巡る
through my chest again today.

353
00:32:10,143 --> 00:32:13,793
Sparkling shiny lights awake true desire

354
00:32:13,793 --> 00:32:16,943
Only my railgun can shoot it 必ず
Only my railgun can shoot it, definitely.

355
00:32:16,943 --> 00:32:20,643
貫いてく 戸惑うことなく
I'll pierce through without hesitation.

356
00:32:20,643 --> 00:32:23,493
傷ついても 走り続ける
Even if I'm hurt, I'll keep running.

357
00:32:23,493 --> 00:32:27,293
狙え！ 凛と煌く視線は
Aim! My dignified and sparkling gaze

358
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:30,543
狂いなく闇を切り裂く
cuts through the darkness without fail.

359
00:32:30,543 --> 00:32:34,343
迷いなんて 吹き飛ばせばいい
Just blow away your doubts.

360
00:32:34,343 --> 00:32:36,743
この心が叫ぶ限り
As long as this heart screams,

361
00:32:36,743 --> 00:32:40,493
誰ひとり邪魔などさせない
I won't let anyone get in the way.

362
00:33:09,893 --> 00:33:13,743
はかなく舞う無数の願いは
Countless fleeting wishes

363
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:17,393
この両手に積もってゆく
pile up in these hands.

364
00:33:17,393 --> 00:33:21,143
切り裂く闇に見えてくるのは
What I see in the darkness I cut through

365
00:33:21,143 --> 00:33:24,493
重く深く切ない記憶
are heavy, deep, and painful memories.

366
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:28,193
色褪せてく現実に揺れる
Swaying in the fading reality,

367
00:33:28,193 --> 00:33:30,443
絶望には負けたくない
I don't want to lose to despair.

368
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:34,243
私が今私であることを胸を張って
I can proudly boast that I am who I am

369
00:33:34,243 --> 00:33:36,993
全て誇れる
right now, and be proud of it all.

370
00:33:37,143 --> 00:33:40,893
Looking the blitz loop this planet to search a way

371
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:44,343
Only my railgun can shoot it 今すぐ
Only my railgun can shoot it, right now.

372
00:33:44,343 --> 00:33:48,093
身体中を光の速さで
At the speed of light through my whole body,

373
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:50,543
駆け巡った 確かな予感
a certain premonition coursed through.

374
00:33:50,543 --> 00:33:54,293
放て！ 心に刻んだ夢を
Release it! The dream etched in your heart

375
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:56,993
未来さえも置き去りにした
left even the future behind.

376
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:00,693
限界など知らない 意味ない
I know no limits, they're meaningless.

377
00:34:00,693 --> 00:34:04,343
この力が光散らす
This power scatters light.

378
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:08,893
その先に遥かな想いを
Beyond that, far-reaching thoughts.

379

#沙花叉アニソンフェス
#SakamataAnisongFes

380
00:34:18,543 --> 00:34:23,793
はい！ということで、すみません、よだれで溺れましたが、ちょっと許してください。
Yes! So, sorry, I choked on my own spit, but please forgive me.

381
00:34:23,793 --> 00:34:28,843
えー、沙花叉アニソンフェスということで、ちょっとみんなが知っていたりとかね、
Um, since this is the Sakamata Anisong Fes, I've performed some songs that everyone knows,

382
00:34:28,843 --> 00:34:33,493
個人的に沙花叉が好きな曲を披露させていただきました。
or that I personally like.

383
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:36,993
どうだったでしょうか？みんな、いい感じだった？
How was it? Was it good, everyone?

384
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:40,743
ちょっとここ見てますよ。いい感じでしたか？
I'm looking at the chat here. Was it good?

385
00:34:40,743 --> 00:34:44,843
トレンド1位も、ありがとうございます！本当にありがとう。
Thank you for the #1 trend too! Truly, thank you.

386
00:34:44,843 --> 00:34:47,393
あの、よかったら、こっちかな？こっちだ。
Um, if you'd like, is it this way? This way.

387
00:34:47,393 --> 00:34:52,093
えー、沙花叉アニソンフェスで、呟いてください。よろしくお願いします。
Please tweet with the hashtag #SakamataAnisongFes. Thank you.

388
00:34:52,093 --> 00:34:54,843
ホント選曲神だった？ありがとうございます！
Was the setlist really god-tier? Thank you!

389
00:34:54,843 --> 00:35:00,093
あ、ということでですね、ちょっと改めてなんですけれども、えー、たくさんのね、ホロックス5人揃っての...
Ah, and so, just once again, um, many... all five of HoloX together...

390
00:35:00,105 --> 00:35:04,955
今まではね、あの…5人、坂本さんと合わせて5人ですよね？
Until now, there were... five, right? Five including Sakamoto-san.

391
00:35:04,955 --> 00:35:08,580
5人揃ってのゲストが今までは普通だったんですけど。
Having five guests together was the norm until now.

392
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,255
今回、なんと先輩方を誘ったり、あとMay'nさんがね、来ていただいたりなど。
This time, I invited my seniors, and even May'n-san came to perform.

393
00:35:13,255 --> 00:35:16,930
結構スペシャルな1日になったんじゃないかなと思うんですが。
I think it's become quite a special day.

394
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,655
どうだったでしょうか？
What did you think of it?

395
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:22,080
びっくりしたでしょ？絶対ゲスト予想当てられないと思ったんだよね。
You were surprised, weren't you? I knew you'd never guess the guests.

396
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,580
もうね、5番の予想は絶対に外れると思って出しました。
I put out that fifth guess thinking everyone would definitely get it wrong.

397
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,580
意地悪しました、すみません。すみません。
I was being mean, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

398
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,330
ということでですね、えー、まあまたステージの方もね。
And so, well, the stage too...

399
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,530
色々作ってもらってめちゃめちゃ良かったんですが。
They made so many things for it, and it turned out great.

400
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,055
こちらの振り返りの方でお話しさせていただければと思います。
I'd like to talk about it more during the look-back section.

401
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,555
しっかり紹介したいので。めちゃいいっすね、これでもね。
Because I want to introduce it properly. It's really cool, isn't it?

402
00:35:42,555 --> 00:35:44,880
めちゃめちゃいい。フェス会場。ありがとうございます。
The festival venue is amazing. Thank you so much.

403
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:51,055
ではですね、配信も丁度半分終わったところなので。
Now then, since we're exactly halfway through the stream...

404
00:35:51,055 --> 00:35:53,380
今日は企画を持ってきました。
I've brought a special segment for today.

405
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:57,280
じゃじゃーん。せっかくのアニソンフェスということで。
Ta-da! Since this is an Anisong Festival...

406
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,380
せーの！「サカマタ生アフレコ」！
Ready, go! "Sakamata Live Dubbing"!

407
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,355
イエーイ！
Yay!

408
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:05,605
サカマタ生アフレコ
Sakamata Live Dubbing

409
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,880
はい、こちらですね。ちょっとどういったものなのかっていうのを説明させてください。
Yes, this is it. Let me explain what it is.

410
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,855
今からですね、過去にもう公開済みのホロぐらのVTRを流しながら。
I'll play a HoloGra clip that's already been released...

411
00:36:15,855 --> 00:36:19,355
沙花叉が生アフレコをしていきたいと思います。
And I, Sakamata, will dub it live.

412
00:36:19,355 --> 00:36:21,855
まず最初はこちらです。
First up is this one.

413
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:25,530
はい、「世界征服は沙花叉した」です。覚えてますか？
Yes, "World Domination Has Begun". Do you remember it?

414
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:30,280
それではまずは実際に投稿された映像の一部を見ていきましょう。どうぞ！
First, let's watch a part of the original footage. Here you go!

415
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:30,330
2022/11/27 世界征服は沙花叉した
2022/11/27 World Domination Has Begun

416
00:36:32,505 --> 00:36:34,355
まずは世界征服の議題。
First, the agenda for world domination.

417
00:36:34,355 --> 00:36:36,830
足がかりにホロライブを…
As a foothold, Hololive will...

418
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,255
何でこんな高いんだよ！おい、インターン！
Why is it so high! Hey, intern!

419
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,030
寝てるね。
She's sleeping.

420
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,880
起きろ！
Wake up!

421
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,555
価値観を根こそぎ変えろ。
Change their values entirely.

422
00:36:52,555 --> 00:36:54,055
それ何の意味があるの？
What's the point of that?

423
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:57,080
学ぶは真似ぶと言うか。
Well, they say learning is imitating.

424
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,555
つまり。
In other words.

425
00:36:58,555 --> 00:37:02,080
何も分かってないでしょ。おい、真面目に会議して！
You don't get it at all. Hey, take this meeting seriously!

426
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,380
はい、これがね、その回の代一部なんですけれども。
Yes, that was a part of that episode.

427
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,255
ちょっとこの回のアフレコをしていきたいと思うんですが。
I'm going to try dubbing this episode live.

428
00:37:10,255 --> 00:37:14,330
別にタイミングとか出されるわけじゃないので、マジで、あの空気読みです。
Since there are no timing cues, I'll have to read the room.

429
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,880
覚えてるかどうかの記憶力ゲーです。
It's a game of memory to see if I remember it all.

430
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,505
では行きたいと思います。お願いします。
All right, let's do this. Here we go.

431
00:37:22,105 --> 00:37:23,105
ござる！
Gozaru!

432
00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:24,105
ずら！
Zura!

433
00:37:24,105 --> 00:37:25,605
掃除中！
Cleaning in progress!

434
00:37:25,605 --> 00:37:27,605
イエス、マイ・ダーク！
Yes, My Dark!

435
00:37:31,605 --> 00:37:33,405
行くぞ、野郎共！
Let's go, guys!

436
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:39,605
今日は気分じゃないかもしれない…
Maybe I'm not in the mood today...

437
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:40,905
えー！？
Eh!?

438
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:43,605
作戦会議日和かもしれない。
Maybe it's a good day for a strategy meeting.

439
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:47,605
ぶえー！
Buehh!

440
00:37:48,405 --> 00:37:51,405
ござる！
Gozaru!

441
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:53,105
掃除中！
Cleaning in progress!

442
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,105
ずら！
Zura!

443
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:57,105
マイ・ダーク！
My Dark!

444
00:38:00,105 --> 00:38:02,605
ホロックス！イエーイ！
HoloX! Yay!

445
00:38:05,605 --> 00:38:06,905
寝てるね。
She's sleeping.

446
00:38:06,905 --> 00:38:08,605
起きろ！
Wake up!

447
00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:10,605
起きた。痛い。
I'm awake. Ouch.

448
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:12,405
何の意味があるの？
What's the point?

449
00:38:12,405 --> 00:38:14,105
真似ぶ。
Imitate.

450
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:15,605
つまり。
In other words.

451
00:38:15,605 --> 00:38:20,605
意味分かってない。何で痛い。ちゃんと。
You don't understand. Why does it hurt? Be serious.

452
00:38:21,605 --> 00:38:24,405
ルイの頭脳が必要だ。
We need Lui's intellect.

453
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:26,605
お願いします。
Please do.

454
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,905
刮目せよ！
Witness this!

455
00:38:29,905 --> 00:38:31,605
それ、吾輩のセリフ！
That's my line!

456
00:38:31,605 --> 00:38:34,405
何ができるの？シャボン玉が出る。
What can you do? Bubbles will come out.

457
00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:36,105
何の意味があるの？
What's the point of that?

458
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:39,605
世界中の子供達がこれに夢中になり。
Children all over the world will be obsessed with this.

459
00:38:39,605 --> 00:38:42,605
どこもかしこもシャボン液まみれに。
Everywhere will be covered in bubble solution.

460
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:45,405
世界がどんどんベトベトになっていき。
The world will become stickier and stickier.

461
00:38:45,405 --> 00:38:50,105
お風呂の回数が極端に増え。
The number of baths will increase dramatically.

462
00:38:50,105 --> 00:38:53,405
みんなリラックスして、油断したところ。
When everyone is relaxed and off guard...

463
00:38:53,405 --> 00:38:55,605
ホロックスが叩く！
HoloX strikes!

464
00:38:55,605 --> 00:38:56,605
そうはならんやろ！
That's not how it works!

465
00:38:56,605 --> 00:38:59,105
ほいっ、はっ、遊ぶな！
Hup, ha! Stop playing around!

466
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,405
いろはちゃん。クロた。
Iroha-chan. Chloe.

467
00:39:05,605 --> 00:39:07,605
何？
What?

468
00:39:07,605 --> 00:39:09,605
総帥、こちらへ。
Leader, this way.

469
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:14,605
敵兵は一つ、単身で乗り込んでくるとはね。
One enemy troop, coming in alone.

470
00:39:15,605 --> 00:39:18,605
てけてけてけてけ。
Pitter-patter pitter-patter.

471
00:39:18,605 --> 00:39:22,605
目標は？分かんないから。
Objective? I don't know.

472
00:39:23,105 --> 00:39:26,105
誰か助けて！
Someone, help!

473
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:28,105
大丈夫ですよ。
It's all right.

474
00:39:28,105 --> 00:39:31,605
沙花叉、風真、接敵！
Sakamata, Kazama, engage the enemy!

475
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:34,605
ほえっ、ほえー。
Hoe? Hoee.

476
00:39:37,405 --> 00:39:39,605
いえーい。
Yay.

477
00:39:40,405 --> 00:39:41,605
にゃーん。
Meow.

478
00:39:41,605 --> 00:39:44,605
ほげーっ！猫！
Hogee! A cat!

479
00:39:45,105 --> 00:39:46,605
あい！
Eye!

480
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:52,530
いや、本当に相変わらずホロぐらでしたね。
Wow, that really was classic HoloGra.

481
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:56,505
はい、でも今回ちょっとやった一本目はですね。
Yes, but this first one I did...

482
00:39:56,505 --> 00:39:59,980
セリフ少ない方なんですよ。
It was one of the ones with fewer lines.

483
00:40:00,217 --> 00:40:02,417
1本目は猫ずこうもなんとなく覚えてたんですけど、
I vaguely remembered 'Neko Zukou' for the first one,

484
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:04,717
2本目めちゃくちゃセリフ多いです。
but the second one has a ton of lines.

485
00:40:04,717 --> 00:40:05,917
2本目こちら！
Here's the second one!

486
00:40:06,117 --> 00:40:08,617
サカマタ生アフレコ
Sakamata Live Dubbing

487
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:12,617
2022/11/20 実体の無い雑魚に負けるわけない！……よね？
Nov 20, 2022 - There's no way I'd lose to a non-existent small fry! ...Right?

488
00:40:13,217 --> 00:40:15,617
では、また実際の映像の一部を見てください。
Now, please take a look at a portion of the actual footage.

489
00:40:15,617 --> 00:40:17,617
どうぞ！
Here you go!

490
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,917
真っ暗。説明しよう。
It's pitch black. Let me explain.

491
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:24,117
なんか起きたら夜になってて、誰もいないし帰りたいんだけど、
I woke up and it was night, nobody's around and I want to go home,

492
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:26,617
あ、鍵持ってないじゃん。
but oh, I don't have my keys.

493
00:40:26,617 --> 00:40:29,117
流石に戸締りしないのはまずいかなーって。
I thought it'd be bad not to lock up.

494
00:40:29,117 --> 00:40:31,617
だから帰るに帰れないわけよ。
So I just can't go home.

495
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:33,917
とりあえず。
Anyway.

496
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:38,617
いや、マジでね、全然覚えてないっすけど。
No, seriously, I don't remember it at all.

497
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:41,117
ちょっとやっていきたいと思います。
But I'm going to give it a try.

498
00:40:41,117 --> 00:40:44,317
クソほどセリフあるんで、あの、なんか声が遅れて聞こえてきたらね、
There are so many lines, so if my voice sounds lagged,

499
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,617
それはみんなのせいです！
that's on you guys!

500
00:40:46,617 --> 00:40:48,117
じゃ、いきます！
Okay, here I go!

501
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,117
真っ暗。説明しよう。
It's pitch black. Let me explain.

502
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:57,317
なんか起きたら夜になってて、誰もいないし帰りたいんだけど、
I woke up and it was night, nobody's around and I want to go home,

503
00:40:57,317 --> 00:41:00,117
あ、鍵持ってないじゃん。
but oh, I don't have my keys.

504
00:41:00,117 --> 00:41:02,617
流石に戸締りしないのはまずいかなーって。
I thought it'd be bad not to lock up.

505
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:04,617
だから帰るに帰れないわけよ。
So I just can't go home.

506
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:06,917
とりあえず。
Anyway.

507
00:41:08,617 --> 00:41:10,117
あれ？
Huh?

508
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:21,117
ん？あれ？セリフのある、あれ？
Mm? Huh? Where there are lines, wait...

509
00:41:21,117 --> 00:41:23,617
どこで喋ってるんですか？あなた。
Where are you talking from?

510
00:41:24,117 --> 00:41:25,617
えっ、した？
Eh? Below?

511
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:30,617
まーじ、タピオカも最近きつそうだもんね。
Seriously, even Tapioca seems to be having a hard time lately.

512
00:41:40,617 --> 00:41:42,617
ラップ現象だ。
It's a poltergeist.

513
00:41:42,617 --> 00:41:44,617
つまりこの部屋にいるのは...
In other words, the one in this room is...

514
00:41:44,617 --> 00:41:46,317
会いに来るな！
Don't come to see me!

515
00:41:47,117 --> 00:41:49,117
だ、しかし、し、し、し、し！
B-but, h-h-h-h!

516
00:41:49,117 --> 00:41:51,617
実体のない雑魚に負けるサカマタで...
A Sakamata who loses to a non-existent small fry—

517
00:41:51,617 --> 00:41:52,317
ぎゃあああ！
AAAAAAAH!

518
00:41:52,617 --> 00:41:55,617
わしじゃよ。小気味よいシャドウ音が聞こえたのでな。
It's me. I heard some pleasant shadow sounds.

519
00:41:56,117 --> 00:41:58,117
サカマタ！
Sakamata!

520
00:41:58,117 --> 00:41:59,117
ううう...
Uuu...

521
00:42:20,617 --> 00:42:22,617
いや、完璧でしたね。
Man, that was perfect.

522
00:42:22,617 --> 00:42:23,617
よかった。
Glad it went well.

523
00:42:23,617 --> 00:42:26,617
もう一寸の狂いもなく、はい、いけましたね。
Not a single error, yup, I nailed it.

524
00:42:26,617 --> 00:42:28,617
大丈夫でしたね。
It was fine, right?

525
00:42:29,617 --> 00:42:33,617
はい、ということで、サカマタ生アフレコでしたー！
Alright, and that was the Sakamata Live Dubbing segment!

526
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:34,617

Now, after this, the live performance is going to speed up

528
00:42:38,617 --> 00:42:41,117
ちょっと加速していくんですけど、

529
00:42:41,117 --> 00:42:44,117
まだまだ盛り上がっていきますかー！

530
00:42:44,117 --> 00:42:46,617

Please cheer them on along with me.

534
00:43:00,117 --> 00:43:04,617
それでは、ラストスパート最初のゲストはこの方です！
And now, the first guest of the final stretch is... this person!

535
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,617
コホン、皆さーん！
Ahem, hello everyone!

536
00:43:08,617 --> 00:43:10,617
どうもこんばんはー！
Good evening!

537
00:43:10,617 --> 00:43:12,617
森カリオペです。What's up Chloe-chan?
It's Mori Calliope. What's up, Chloe-chan?

538
00:43:12,617 --> 00:43:15,617
カリ先輩！
Calli-senpai!

539
00:43:15,617 --> 00:43:18,617
いやもう、めっちゃ緊張してましたけど、
Man, I was so nervous,

540
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:22,117
カリ先輩が堂々とこう来てくれて、安心しました、今。
but seeing Calli-senpai come out so confidently really put me at ease.

541
00:43:22,117 --> 00:43:24,117
余裕余裕ですよ。
Piece of cake, piece of cake.

542
00:43:24,117 --> 00:43:26,617
ちょっと楽しみましょうよ！
Let's have some fun!

543
00:43:26,617 --> 00:43:29,617
Let's go, 派手にぶちかまそうぜ！
Let's go, let's go out with a bang!

544
00:43:29,617 --> 00:43:31,117
イエーイ！ Let's rock!
Yay! Let's rock!

545
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:45,117
Hey everybody! Are you ready? Let's go!

546
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:49,117
Counteraction rising

547
00:43:49,117 --> 00:43:51,617
Yeah we are ready for the punch line

548
00:43:52,617 --> 00:43:55,317
There's no use with all your gimmicks

549
00:43:55,317 --> 00:43:57,117
So check this out!

550
00:43:57,617 --> 00:43:59,317

Crush the won't you come

552
00:44:00,617 --> 00:44:03,117
The noise comes we are ready to bow

553
00:44:03,117 --> 00:44:05,617
What about the antidote for the jammed and hypnotized

554
00:44:06,117 --> 00:44:08,617
Rend the lie that covers

555
00:44:08,617 --> 00:44:12,317
咲き乱れた花のように 鮮やかな痛み抱き
Like flowers blooming in profusion, embracing a vivid pain

556
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:17,317
佇む街を抜け 迷いのセリフは捨て
Passing through the standing city, throwing away the lines of hesitation

557
00:44:18,617 --> 00:44:22,317
帰らない声よ響け We say wow
Echo, oh voice that won't return! We say wow

558
00:44:24,617 --> 00:44:29,317
Database, database, just living in the database, wow wow

559
00:44:29,617 --> 00:44:33,317
The wall of pure fictions cracking in my head

560
00:44:33,317 --> 00:44:36,117
And the addiction of my world still spreads

561
00:44:36,117 --> 00:44:40,617
In the database, database, I'm struggling in the database, wow wow

562
00:44:40,617 --> 00:44:43,617
It doesn't even matter if there is no hope at all

563
00:44:43,617 --> 00:44:46,617
As the madness of the system grows

564
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,117
Crack in the key for the real clue

565
00:44:49,117 --> 00:44:51,617
Mask presentation reigning on but we know we've been longing for this

566
00:44:51,617 --> 00:44:53,117
Cut it out

567
00:44:53,117 --> 00:44:54,117
The plot that deceived you

568
00:44:54,117 --> 00:44:55,617
Drop the rebel sound

569
00:44:55,617 --> 00:44:56,617
Shut the system down

570
00:44:56,617 --> 00:44:58,617
Reveal the never-found

571
00:44:58,617 --> 00:45:00,117
いつか見た夢を
A dream I once saw

572
00:45:00,129 --> 00:45:03,129
残酷な現実とも見える瓦礫の中で
In the midst of debris that looks like cruel reality

573
00:45:04,629 --> 00:45:07,629
戦い続けるだけ
I just keep on fighting

574
00:45:08,629 --> 00:45:10,629
Get them all from bigger heads, yeah!

575
00:45:11,129 --> 00:45:13,129
You get them all from bigger heads!

576
00:45:13,629 --> 00:45:18,129
重なる世界で滾る心に火を灯して
Light a fire in the boiling heart in overlapping worlds

577
00:45:19,129 --> 00:45:23,129
Database, database, just living in the database, wow wow

578
00:45:24,129 --> 00:45:26,629
The wall of pure fiction's cracking in my head

579
00:45:27,129 --> 00:45:29,629
And the addiction of my world's dispersed in the database

580
00:45:30,129 --> 00:45:33,629
Database, database, I'm struggling in the database, wow wow

581
00:45:34,629 --> 00:45:37,629
It doesn't even matter if there is no hope

582
00:45:38,129 --> 00:45:40,129
Just say wow wow

583
00:45:41,129 --> 00:45:43,129
Hey wait a minute, what happened? The data's wrong! Come on!

584
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:57,629
Shake it! Rock it!

585
00:45:58,129 --> 00:46:00,129
盛り上がっていきましょう！
Let's get pumped up!

586
00:46:15,629 --> 00:46:17,629
時に計算高さは蛇足で Calculator
Sometimes calculation is redundant, Calculator

587
00:46:18,629 --> 00:46:20,629
統計に揺さぶられたまま消えてった
It disappeared while being shaken by statistics

588
00:46:21,629 --> 00:46:23,629
そうなりたくなきゃ Database
If you don't want that, Database

589
00:46:24,129 --> 00:46:26,629
だけに頼らず磨け自分のペース yeah
Don't just rely on that, polish your own pace, yeah

590
00:46:43,129 --> 00:46:47,629
Database, database, just living in the database, wow wow

591
00:46:48,129 --> 00:46:50,629
The wall of pure fiction's cracking in my head

592
00:46:51,129 --> 00:46:53,629
And the addiction of my world's dispersed in the database

593
00:46:54,129 --> 00:46:57,629
Database, database, I'm struggling in the database, wow wow

594
00:46:58,629 --> 00:47:01,629
It doesn't even matter if there is no hope

595
00:47:02,129 --> 00:47:04,629
As the madness of the system grows

596
00:47:05,129 --> 00:47:09,129
Database, database, just living in the database

597
00:47:10,129 --> 00:47:13,129
Database, database, just say wow wow

598
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:24,129

00:47:42,129 --> 00:47:43,129

612
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:45,129
Peace!

613
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,629
はい、ということで...
Yes, and so...

614
00:47:48,129 --> 00:47:52,129
カリ先輩を交えての「database」でした！
That was "database" with Calli-senpai!

615
00:47:52,629 --> 00:47:55,129
ではでは、最後のゲスト...
Now then, the final guest...

616
00:47:55,629 --> 00:47:58,629
呼んじゃおうかな？どうしようかな？
Shall I call them out? What should I do?

617
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:01,129
呼ばないっていう手もありますかね？
Is there an option not to call them?

618
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:02,629
呼んでよ！
Call me!

619
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,629
来ちゃった！来ちゃった！
She came! She came!

00:48:04,629 --> 00:48:06,629
来ちゃった！どなたですか？
She came! Who is it?

The diamond in the rough that appeared like a comet! I'm Idol VTuber Hoshimachi Suisei! Nice to meet you!

623

よろしくお願いしまーす！
Nice to meet you!

624
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:14,629
ちょっと疲れてるんじゃないですか？
Aren't you a bit tired?

625
00:48:15,129 --> 00:48:16,129
いやいや、まだまだっすよ！
No no, I'm still going!

626
00:48:16,629 --> 00:48:17,129
いけるんですか？
Can you do it?

627
00:48:17,129 --> 00:48:18,129
いきますよ！
I'll do it!

628
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:19,129
じゃあ、いってやりましょうよ！
Then let's go for it!

629
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:20,629
ぶちこます、あの曲を！
Let's unleash that song!

630
00:48:21,129 --> 00:48:22,129
いきまそう！
Let's go!

631
00:48:22,129 --> 00:48:23,129
いきまそう！
Let's go!

632
00:48:26,129 --> 00:48:31,129
Please don't say you are lazy, だって本当は crazy
Please don't say you are lazy, because actually you're crazy

633
00:48:32,129 --> 00:48:37,129
白鳥たちはそう、見えないとこでバタ足するんです
Swans are like that, they paddle under the water where you can't see

634
00:48:38,129 --> 00:48:42,129
本能に忠順忠実、本能も重々承知
Obedient and faithful to instinct, well aware of the instinct

635
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:47,129
前途洋々だし、だからたまに休憩しちゃうんです
The future is bright, so I take a break once in a while

636
00:48:48,629 --> 00:48:51,129
はいはいはい！すいぐいいけるのか？！
Yeah yeah yeah! Can you go further?!

637
00:48:59,129 --> 00:49:03,129
この眼でしっかり定めて行き先、秩序はアクシデント
Looking firmly with these eyes at the destination, order is an accident

638
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:14,129
近道あればそれが思うツボ、拗ねる翼もあれば上等
If there's a shortcut, it's just as intended, if there are stubborn wings, even better

639
00:49:20,129 --> 00:49:24,129
ヤバ、爪は割れた、グルーで補修した
Oh no, my nail broke, I fixed it with glue

640
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:29,129
それだけでなんか達成感
Just that gives a sense of accomplishment

641
00:49:30,629 --> 00:49:34,129
大事なのは自分、可愛がること
The important thing is to cherish yourself

642
00:49:35,129 --> 00:49:39,129
自分を愛さなきゃ、他人も愛せない
If you don't love yourself, you can't love others

643
00:49:41,629 --> 00:49:46,129
Please don't say you are lazy, だって本当は crazy
Please don't say you are lazy, because actually you're crazy

644
00:49:47,129 --> 00:49:51,129
能ある鷹はそう、見えないとこでピークを出すんです
We are like that, we peak where you can't see

645
00:49:52,129 --> 00:49:56,629
想像に一生懸命、現実は絶対絶命
Dedicated to imagination, reality is a desperate situation

646
00:49:57,129 --> 00:50:00,129
発展途中だし、だからたまに休憩しちゃうんです
In the middle of development, so I take a break once in a while

647
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:02,941
お気に入りの服に ビーチ外れるんだ
With my favorite clothes, the beach slips away...

648
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:17,641
あぁ そんなに見つめないで
Ah, don't stare at me like that.

649
00:50:23,341 --> 00:50:28,641
いつでも全力で夢見て その分全力で眠って
Always dreaming with all my might, sleeping just as hard.

650
00:50:33,941 --> 00:50:35,941
ほら、ね、ちょい痩せたい
See, hey, I want to lose a little weight.

651
00:50:36,641 --> 00:50:38,341
調子ついて食った
I got carried away and ate.

652
00:50:38,941 --> 00:50:43,141
それだけ? なんで? 全保管!
Is that all? Why? Store it all!

653
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:49,141
透かさずに目標を下方修正して
Without missing a beat, lower the goals.

654
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:54,641
柔軟に臨機応変、百変化勝ち!
Adaptable and flexible, a hundred changes to win!

655
00:50:55,441 --> 00:50:57,741
Please don't say you are lazy

656
00:50:58,341 --> 00:51:00,141
だって本当はcrazy
Because actually, I'm crazy.

657
00:51:00,741 --> 00:51:02,641
孔雀たちはそう
Peacocks are like that,

658
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:05,641
ここぞという時 美を見せるんです
They show their beauty when the time is right.

659
00:51:06,141 --> 00:51:10,941
想像増しまし ガチ恋送信レイジー
Imagination maxed out, sending serious love lazy.

660
00:51:11,841 --> 00:51:16,941
弱気はずだし だからやけに意志だけ強いんです
I'm weak-willed, so only my determination is unusually strong.

661
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:18,941
坂又さーん！
Sakamata-san!

662
00:51:18,941 --> 00:51:21,941
はい、ここで、はい、決着をつけましょう！
Yes, let's settle this right here!

663
00:51:21,941 --> 00:51:23,141
いきますか！
Shall we go?!

664
00:51:23,141 --> 00:51:25,941
最初はグー、ジャンケン、ホイ！
Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!

665
00:51:26,441 --> 00:51:27,941
あっち向いてホイ！
Look that way, hey!

666
00:51:28,141 --> 00:51:31,141
弱っｗｗｗ 最初はグー、ジャンケン、ホイ！
So weak! lol Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!

667
00:51:31,141 --> 00:51:32,941
あいこでしょ！あっち向いてホイ！
It's a tie! Look that way, hey!

668
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:34,641
よっしゃー！
Alright!

669
00:51:35,141 --> 00:51:37,941
ラストいきますよ！はい！最初はグー、ジャンケン、ホイ！
One last time! Okay! Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!

670
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:40,941
あいこでしょ！あっち向いてホイ！
It's a tie! Look that way, hey!

671
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:44,341
最初はグー、ジャンケン、ホイ！あいこでしょ！あっち向いてホイ！
Rock-paper-scissors, shoot! Tie! Look that way, hey!

672
00:51:44,941 --> 00:51:47,641
うぉー！一勝一敗、引き分けー！
Whoa! One win, one loss, it's a draw!

673
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:53,141
やばっ！まさか連敗? いい加減クリア
Oh no! A losing streak? Time to clear it already.

674
00:51:53,741 --> 00:51:58,341
それだけ? なんて? 全部カン
Is that all? Like what? All intuition.

675
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:03,641
大事なのは自分を認めてくこと
The important thing is to acknowledge yourself.

676
00:52:04,141 --> 00:52:08,941
自分を許さなきゃ人も許せない
If you don't forgive yourself, you can't forgive others.

677
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:12,141
Please don't say you are lazy

678
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:14,641
だって本当はcrazy
Because actually, I'm crazy.

679
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:17,641
白鳥たちはそう
Swans are like that,

680
00:52:17,941 --> 00:52:20,641
見えないところでバタ足するんです
They flutter their legs where you can't see.

681
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:25,941
本能に忠実 翻弄も承知
Faithful to instinct, knowing I'm at its mercy.

682
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:31,641
前途洋々だし だからたまに休憩しちゃうんです
The future is bright, so I take a break once in a while.

683
00:52:45,941 --> 00:52:47,641
決まったぜー！
That's it!

684
00:52:47,641 --> 00:52:50,141
いや何でこれなん、あははは。何でなんですか
Wait, why this? Hahaha. Why is it like this?

685
00:52:50,141 --> 00:52:52,641

Thank you so much! Thank you!

686
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:54,141

Thank you! That was so much fun!

688
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:57,641
一勝一敗ね
One win, one loss, right?

689
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:02,641
そうですね、次こそ！ね、次こそまた決着を！よろしくお願いいたします！
Right, next time for sure! Let's settle it then! I look forward to it!

690
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:06,641
では！ありがとうございましたー！またねー！バイバイー！
Well then! Thank you very much! See you! Bye-bye!

691
00:53:08,641 --> 00:53:14,141
はい、というわけでですね、データベースとDon't say 'lazy' 続けてお送りしました。
Alright, and so, we brought you 'Database' and 'Don't say "lazy"' back-to-back.

692
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:18,641
ありがとうございましたー！イェーイ！
Thank you so much! Yay!

693
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:26,141
はい、ではいよいよ本当に配信もガチラストスパートとなりました。
Alright, it's finally time for the real final spurt of the stream.

694
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:30,341
ここで重大なお知らせが2点あります。まず、
I have two major announcements here. First,

695
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:38,141
皆さんご存知、ま、ご存知ですよね? 坂又クロヱ活動2周年記念グッズー！
As you all know... well, you do know, right? Sakamata Chloe 2nd Anniversary Goods!

696
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:41,641
沙花叉クロヱ 活動2周年記念
Sakamata Chloe 2nd Anniversary

697
00:53:42,641 --> 00:53:45,141
イェー！…えっ、ちょ、なんかおっぱい毎回増えてません?
Yay! ...Wait, aren't my breasts getting bigger every time?

698
00:53:45,641 --> 00:53:53,141
え、さすがパセリと言ったところでね、本当に可愛らしいキービジュとなっております。
As expected of Parsley-sensei, it's a really lovely key visual.

699
00:53:54,141 --> 00:53:59,641
今回はですね、配信に合わせてフェスの音供になるようなグッズを用意させていただきました。
This time, I've prepared goods that can be your festival companions.

700
00:54:00,141 --> 00:54:02,641
では、紹介したいと思います。まずは、こちら！
Now, let me introduce them. First, this one!

701
00:54:03,141 --> 00:54:04,341
アクリルスタンド
Acrylic Stand

702
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:10,141
はい、アクリルスタンドですね！やっぱりアクリルスタンド、坂又が好きっていうのもそうなんですが、
Yes, an acrylic stand! Of course, it's because I love them,

703
00:54:10,141 --> 00:54:15,141
お部屋に飾ってほしいなーと思っております。台座もね、結構こだわっていますので、
but I'd love for you to display it in your room. I put a lot of work into the base too,

704
00:54:15,141 --> 00:54:21,641
ま、並べてもいいし、これから出すね、グッズと合わせてもいいなーと思ってます。さあ、次は、こちら！
so you can line them up or pair them with the other goods I'm about to show. Next up is this!

705
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:23,641
クロヱとおそろいフード付きタオル
Chloe matching hooded towel

706
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:30,141
はい、クロヱとおそろいフード付きタオルー！やっぱりフェスはタオルっしょ。
Yes, a hooded towel matching Chloe's! You can't have a festival without a towel, right?

707
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:35,641
ね、タオルないとはじまんないよね、肩にかけたいよね。ということで、フードは取り外し可能となっておりますので、
It doesn't start without one! You want to drape it over your shoulders. The hood is detachable,

708
00:54:35,641 --> 00:54:41,641
是非とも使っていただけると嬉しいな。夏フェスとかにもいいしね、なんかライブとか行くのにもいいかなーと思っております。
so I'd be happy if you'd use it. It's great for summer festivals or when you go to live shows.

709
00:54:41,641 --> 00:54:48,641
坂又とね、おそろっちになってしまうという悪夢ですね。さあ、続いてこちら！
It's a nightmare of being twinsies with me. Anyway, next is this!

710
00:54:50,141 --> 00:54:51,141
サコッシュ
Sacoche

711
00:54:51,141 --> 00:54:55,141
サコッシュです！こちらとね、組み合わせんのもいいかなと思って。
It's a sacoche! I thought it would be nice to pair it with this.

712
00:54:55,141 --> 00:54:59,141
アクスタ非常に可愛らしいデザインになってますよね。これ、ちょっと天才だと思ったんですよね…
The acrylic stand has a very cute design. I really thought this was a stroke of genius...

713
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:01,953
坂又、デザインの方々、本当ありがとうございます。
Sakamata is so thankful to the designers.

714
00:55:01,953 --> 00:55:05,253
マジで、あの裏地まで可愛いので是非見てみてください。
Seriously, even the lining is cute, so please check it out.

715
00:55:05,253 --> 00:55:08,453
あの、表側はですね、透明になっていますんで、
The front side is transparent,

716
00:55:08,453 --> 00:55:11,953
アクスタとか缶バッジとか、ま、そういうものも入れられますので、
so you can put in things like acrylic stands and badges.

717
00:55:11,953 --> 00:55:15,053
是非オタクグッズとしても活用してみてください。
Please use it to show off your otaku goods.

718
00:55:15,053 --> 00:55:16,053
そして、こちら。
And next is this.

719
00:55:16,053 --> 00:55:18,053
あー、ついに来ちゃったんですね。
Ah, it's finally here.

720
00:55:18,053 --> 00:55:24,553
イヌが、ぬいぐるみマスコットとなりました。
Inu has been made into a plushie mascot.

721
00:55:24,553 --> 00:55:26,453
ついにイヌもですか。
Inu too, finally?

722
00:55:26,453 --> 00:55:29,553
なんか、イヌがなるのムカつくなーと思うんですけど、
It's kind of annoying that Inu got one too, but...

723
00:55:29,553 --> 00:55:35,053
やっぱり可愛らしいので、ちょっと坂又のサコッシュと組み合わせてもいいかなとか思うし、
it's cute, so I think it'd be nice to pair it with Sakamata's sacoche.

724
00:55:35,053 --> 00:55:38,953
なんか、普通にね、坂又のぬいとかフレンズぬいとかありますよね。
There are also the Sakamata and Friends plushies.

725
00:55:38,953 --> 00:55:42,653
そういうのと組み合わせても、まあ可愛いのかなとは思います。
