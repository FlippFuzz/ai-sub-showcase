完備の 完備の 夢見る走行
Perfect, perfect, dream-seeing running.

153
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:32,245
そこに 縁があると信じて
Believing that there's a connection there.

154
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:36,145
頑張るだけ 損じゃ なんとなく 察しちゃうじゃん
Just working hard is a loss, somehow I've sensed it.

155
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:39,045
生まれた時にさ 配られていた手札が
The hand I was dealt when I was born.

156
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:42,545
弱かったら 終わりだって 先なんて 知れてるって
If it's weak, it's over, and the future is already known.

157
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:45,345
覆しちゃいなよ って あー、もう！
Overturn it! ...Ah, geez!

158
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,745
まだ待って いらんない わけだって
I can't wait anymore, because...

159
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:05,645
手札なんて 自分次第なんだって
The hand you have depends on yourself.

160
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:09,345
いつまで 夢に逃げてるんでしょ
How long are you going to keep running to your dreams?

161
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:12,145
そろそろ はよ起きる 時間だろ
It's about time to wake up, isn't it?

162
00:13:12,845 --> 00:13:16,145
目を醒ませ 刹那トリップ
Wake up, Setsuna Trip.

163
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:19,045
飛べない わけない いま眩しい リアルにダイブ
I can't not fly, dive into the now dazzling reality.

164
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:22,645
脇目も振らず 逃げずに勝負
Without looking aside, fight without running.

165
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:25,545
絶対 いたいわ しない
I'll definitely never let it hurt.

166
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:29,445
覚悟決めて 駆け抜けろ
Make up your mind and run through!

167
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:59,045
わっくわっくわっくわん！
Waku waku waku wan!

168
00:13:59,145 --> 00:14:03,545
秘密結社holoXの掃除担当、沙花叉クロヱです！
I'm Sakamata Chloe, in charge of cleaning for Secret Society holoX!

169
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:05,545
いただきまーす！
Let's eat!

170
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:11,245
ということで、今日は沙花叉の誕生日に来てくれてありがとー！
So, thank you all for coming to Sakamata's birthday today!

171
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:14,345
刹那トリップ歌わせていただきましたー！
I just sang 'Setsuna Trip'!

172
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:18,545
なんか、ちょっと頭がぷあぷあする気がするんですけど
I feel like my head is a bit fuzzy, though.

173
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:21,045
気のせいだよね？気のせいだよね？
It's just my imagination, right? Right?

174
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:26,545
引き続き、飼育員さんたちと一緒にこのライブを楽しんでいけたらなと思うので
I'd like to continue enjoying this live together with all the Interns,

175
00:14:26,645 --> 00:14:30,045
よかったらハッシュタグとかでもね
so if you'd like, please tweet using the hashtag and all that.

176
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:33,445
あのツイートしてもらえたら嬉しいなと思います！
It would make me really happy!

177
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:37,645
では、このあとお着替えしちゃうので
Now, I'm going to change clothes after this,

178
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:41,045
ちょっと見ない、見ないでくださいね！
so please don't, don't look, okay?

179
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:43,045
やめてくださいよ！やだ！
Stop it! No!

180
00:14:43,145 --> 00:14:46,045
じゃ、着替えます！ちょっと、見ないで！
Okay, I'm going to change! Hey, don't look!

181
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:49,045
あっち行って！あっち行って！
Go away! Go away!

182
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:14,057
パレパレパレ 輝くんだよ
Pare-pare-pare, it's shining.

183
00:15:15,257 --> 00:15:21,057
呼び合う声を合図に
With our calling voices as the signal.

184
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:28,057
パレパレパレ 探しに行く
Pare-pare-pare, let's go search.

185
00:15:29,557 --> 00:15:35,057
スタートは何度だって
No matter how many times we start.

186
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:48,557
皆様、盛り上がっていきましょう！
Everyone, let's get excited!

187
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:48,557
Our Bright Parade
作詞・作曲・編曲 堀江晶太
Our Bright Parade
Lyrics, Comp., & Arr.: Shota Horie

188
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:59,257
ただ 独り言綴った
I just wrote down some monologues.

189
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:04,257
ただ 始まりたくて走った
I just ran because I wanted to begin.

190
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:09,557
遠く グラデーションに灯った
A distant gradation lit up.

191
00:16:10,557 --> 00:16:14,557
それは 眩しすぎたままで
It remained far too dazzling.

192
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:19,557
それは 優しすぎる思い出
It's a memory that's far too kind.

193
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:24,557
もっと近づけと手を伸ばした
I reached out my hand to get closer.

194
00:16:25,257 --> 00:16:27,557
思いがけず結び合った
We were connected unexpectedly.

195
00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:30,857
ほら今 迷い子は僕らになった
Look, now we've become the lost children.

196
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:35,557
パレパレパレ 輝くんだよ
Pare-pare-pare, it's shining.

197
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:41,257
悔しさも愛おしさも 全部おいで
Come along with all your regrets and affections.

198
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:46,057
風 夢 羽 飛び立つさ
Wind, dreams, wings—we'll take flight.

199
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:51,557
囁かな彩りばかり 終わりなき兆し
Only modest colors, signs that never end.

200
00:16:52,257 --> 00:16:56,257
君を見つけたこと 胸を張るよ
I'm proud that I found you.

201
00:16:57,257 --> 00:17:00,057
ここから これから
From here, from now on.

202
00:17:12,557 --> 00:17:16,257
まだ 頼りない予感を
Sing about this still-unreliable premonition,

203
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:21,257
歌おう 恥ずかしくなんてないよ
Let's sing it—it's nothing to be ashamed of.

204
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:26,557
誰も解けないイマジナリー
An imaginary world no one can solve.

205
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:31,557
いつかまた会えるおまじない
A charm to meet again someday.

206
00:17:32,257 --> 00:17:36,257
あの日 ゼロに始まったストーリー
The story that began from zero that day.

207
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,057
数えきれない言の葉
Countless words.

208
00:17:40,257 --> 00:17:43,257
数えるような思いじゃないさ
It's not a feeling you can count.

209
00:17:44,257 --> 00:17:47,557
ほら今 僕らをひとつと呼ぼう
Look, now let's call us one.

210
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:52,557
パレパレパレ 美しいんだよ
Pare-pare-pare, it's beautiful.

211
00:17:53,257 --> 00:17:57,557
許し合える切なさ 夜は開けてく
Sadness of forgiving, the night is breaking.

212
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:02,557
雨 晴れ 晴れ また隣 空
Rain, sun, sun, the sky next to us again.

213
00:18:03,257 --> 00:18:08,557
相応しい旅路とは 君と歩くことさ
The right journey is one walked with you.

214
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:13,857
君と歩くことなんだ
It's all about walking with you.

215
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,557
ただいま も 聞けば
If I hear 'I'm home,'

216
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:23,257
おかえりって叫ぶよ
I'll shout back 'Welcome back.'

217
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:28,057
当たり前じゃないか
Isn't that obvious?

218
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:34,557
パレパレパレ 輝くんだよ
Pare-pare-pare, it's shining.

219
00:18:35,257 --> 00:18:40,557
暗がりを満たすのは 君だ 僕だ
It's you and me who fill the darkness.

220
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:45,557
パレパレパレ 輝くんだよ
Pare-pare-pare, it's shining.

221
00:18:46,257 --> 00:18:51,257
悔しさも愛おしさも 全部おいで
Come along with all your regrets and affections.

222
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:56,257
風 夢 羽 飛び立つさ
Wind, dreams, wings—we'll take flight.

223
00:18:57,857 --> 00:19:01,557
囁かな彩りばかり 終わりなき兆し
Only modest colors, signs that never end.

224
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:06,557
君と飛び込んでいこう 素敵なスタートさ
Let's dive in with you, it's a wonderful start.

225
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:10,057
ここから これから
From here, from now on.

226
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:51,557
この空がトリガー
作詞 指原莉乃 作曲 塚田耕平
Kono Sora ga Trigger
Lyrics: Rino Sashihara, Comp.: Kohei Tsukada

227
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:56,557
眩しい太陽を見上げたとき
When I looked up at the dazzling sun.

228
00:19:57,557 --> 00:20:01,257
君に会いたくなった
I wanted to see you.

229
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:02,069
あの空がトリガー
That sky was the trigger

230
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:25,169
恋人がいるって 最初から知ってた
I knew from the start that you had a lover

231
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:30,569
話の合う ただの友達
Just a friend I could talk to

232
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:36,569
君に勧められた 映画の半券って
The ticket stub for the movie you recommended...

233
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:41,469
なんとなく外せない
I somehow can't bring myself to throw it away

234
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:48,469
向かいの方向き 君と目が合った
Looking across at you, our eyes met

235
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:54,469
今日こそ 二人の赤い糸
Surely today, the red thread between us...

236
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:58,769
切り離す 意地悪ね
...will be cut. How mean

237
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:06,569
青い空が綺麗だった日 あの日を忘れてない
I haven't forgotten that day when the blue sky was so beautiful

238
00:21:06,902 --> 00:21:11,902
目に映るものすべて
Everything that reflects in my eyes...

239
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:18,569
これは君を想いつづく歌 私だけの青春
This is a song about thinking of you, my own private youth

240
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:23,769
あの空がトリガーだったよ
That sky was the trigger

241
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:29,669
君が好きだ
I love you

242
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:44,269
あのバンドがついに ツアーするって一応
That band is finally going on tour, so just in case...

243
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:49,269
2枚で申し込む
I applied for two tickets

244
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:55,769
あの映画はどこで 行ったのかな 集中
I wonder where that movie went. Focus

245
00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:01,369
できず 誰かの横顔とか
I couldn't, looking at someone's side profile...

246
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:06,569
気にしたの きっとそう
...and worrying about it. Surely that's it

247
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:14,269
君は何も気づいていない あの日の空模様も
You haven't noticed anything, not even the state of the sky that day

248
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:18,569
君には いつもの空
To you, it's just the usual sky

249
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:25,902
愛おしくも見つけたら 誰に教えるのでしょう
If you find something dear, who would you tell?

250
00:22:26,402 --> 00:22:30,969
シャッターの音が響いた
The sound of the shutter echoed

251
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:35,869
行方はどこ
Where is it headed?

252
00:23:00,469 --> 00:23:05,469
さあ 向かっていくか 坂道を
Now, shall I head up the slope?

253
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:11,869
恋を 曖昧にごまかす
My love, I vaguely cover it up

254
00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:17,069
この想い 伝えちゃダメとわかっている
I know I shouldn't convey these feelings

255
00:23:17,402 --> 00:23:22,969
だけど だけど だけど だけど
But... but... but... but...

256
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:29,269
心にずっと君がいる
You are always in my heart

257
00:23:29,402 --> 00:23:36,169
青い空が綺麗だった日 私だけが覚えて
I'm the only one who remembers that day the blue sky was beautiful

258
00:23:36,402 --> 00:23:41,569
君は誰かを想う
You are thinking of someone else

259
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:47,369
なのに勝手に好きでごめんね 私このままでいい
And yet, I'm sorry for loving you on my own. I'm fine like this

260
00:23:47,535 --> 00:23:54,869
空しか知らない この恋
This love that only the sky knows

261
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:59,869
秘密にして
Keep it a secret

262
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:04,269
君と二人で あの日会ったこと
The fact that the two of us met that day...

263
00:24:04,535 --> 00:24:10,569
言わないから 想っていたい
...I won't say it, because I want to keep loving you

264
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,069
サラバ、愛しき悲しみたちよ
Farewell, My Dear Sorrows

265
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:05,081
サラバ、愛しき悲しみたちよ
Farewell, My Dear Sorrows

266
00:25:10,231 --> 00:25:11,281
行くの？
Are you going?

267
00:25:11,281 --> 00:25:12,431
行かないの？
Are you not going?

268
00:25:12,431 --> 00:25:13,631
言っちゃえばいいじゃん
Why don't you just say it?

269
00:25:13,631 --> 00:25:14,831
言えないよ
I can't say it

270
00:25:14,831 --> 00:25:16,131
いたいよ煩いよ言えない
It hurts, it's noisy, I can't say it

271
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:18,531
表だ 裏だって殺しのクエスチョン
Front or back, it's a killer question

272
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:21,481
だけどどうしたって何もかも台無し
But no matter what, everything is ruined

273
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:32,481
Aha! Diggi-diggi... Aha! Diggi-down

274
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,781
見ざる
See no evil

275
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:34,981
言わざる
Speak no evil

276
00:25:34,981 --> 00:25:36,181
聞かざるでござる
Hear no evil, that's the way

277
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:38,581
君子危うきに近寄らずです
A wise man keeps away from danger

278
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:40,981
俺がされたら止めたくなります
If it were me, I'd want to stop

279
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:44,281
だったら許す だったら笑え
Then forgive, then smile

280
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:49,831
心の声が木霊する
The voice of my heart echoes

281
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:54,881
涙と希望のカーニバル
A carnival of tears and hope

282
00:25:55,781 --> 00:26:00,681
生意気なくらいの夜明けに
To an audaciously bright dawn

283
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:03,281
行かないで
Don't go

284
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:05,731
行かないで
Don't go

285
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,931
泣かないで
Don't cry

286
00:26:09,181 --> 00:26:11,381
泣かないで
Don't cry

287
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:15,881
サラバ 奇蹟を脱ぎ捨てて
Farewell, cast off your miracles

288
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:18,931
勇気の声を振り絞れ
Muster your voice of courage

289
00:26:18,931 --> 00:26:24,031
自分と呼ぶ名の愛を知るために
To know the love that bears your own name

290
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:27,581
眠れない羊の群れよ
O flock of sleepless sheep

291
00:26:27,581 --> 00:26:30,631
迷える心の叫びを
Let out the cry of your wandering heart

292
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,681
振り返れば我らの世界はまだ
Looking back, our world has only

293
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:40,531
始まったばかりだ
just begun

294
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:50,181
寂しい思いさせてんじゃねえよ
Don't go making me feel lonely

295
00:26:50,181 --> 00:26:52,631
やるの サボるの サボればいいじゃん
To work or slack, slacking is fine too

296
00:26:52,631 --> 00:26:55,381
そんあ嘘でも まさかの呼吸
Even if it's a lie, an unexpected breath

297
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:59,081
褒めてますから 全力で
I'm praising you, with all my might

298
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:04,981
そしてどこまでも続く夢を見た
And I saw a dream that goes on forever

299
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:10,231
天使が舞い降りてきた
An angel came dancing down

300
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:16,131
そしてどこまでも続く空の下
And beneath a sky that goes on forever

301
00:27:16,131 --> 00:27:21,131
自由になりたい
I want to be free

302
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:46,781
One, Two and Three, Four, Five

303
00:27:46,781 --> 00:27:49,181
Hands up Stand up Free your soul

304
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:51,681
One, Two and Three, Four, Five

305
00:27:51,681 --> 00:27:54,181
Hands up Stand up Free your soul

306
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:57,981
One, Two and Three, Four, Five

307
00:27:57,981 --> 00:28:00,681
Hands up and Make sunrise!

308
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:12,181
Aha! Do-it, Do-it... Aha! Do-it-now

309
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:19,531
心の声が木霊する
The voice of my heart echoes

310
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:24,581
涙と希望のカーニバル
A carnival of tears and hope

311
00:28:25,481 --> 00:28:30,481
生意気なくらいの夜明けに
To an audaciously bright dawn

312
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:34,981
揺らすんだ
Shake it

313
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:37,381
揺らすんだ
Shake it

314
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:39,981
進むんだ
Move forward

315
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:42,381
進むんだ
Move forward

316
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:47,381
サラバ 奇蹟を脱ぎ捨てて
Farewell, cast off your miracles

317
00:28:47,381 --> 00:28:50,431
勇気の声を振り絞れ
Muster your voice of courage

318
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:55,481
自分と呼ぶ名の愛を知るために
To know the love that bears your own name

319
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:59,031
眠れない羊の群れよ
O flock of sleepless sheep

320
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:02,131
迷える心の叫びを
Let out the cry of your wandering heart

321
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:05,181
振り返れば我らの世界はまだ
Looking back, our world has only

322
00:29:05,181 --> 00:29:12,181
始まったばかりだ
just begun

323
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:23,831
Aha! Diggi-diggi... Aha! Diggi-down

324
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:39,181
Aha! Do-it, Do-it... Do it now!

325
00:29:54,681 --> 00:30:00,081
はい、というわけで、アワーブライトパレード、この空がトリガー、サラバ...
Alright, so that was 'Our Bright Parade', 'Kono Sora ga Trigger', and 'Saraba'...

326
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,393
「サラバ、愛しき悲しみたちよ」でした！
That was "Farewell, My Dear Sorrows"!

327
00:30:01,693 --> 00:30:02,893
どうだったみんな？
How was it, everyone?

328
00:30:02,893 --> 00:30:04,293
どうでした？どうでした？
How did you like it? How did you like it?

329
00:30:04,293 --> 00:30:07,493
「アワ・ブライト・パレード」は、沙花叉が
For "Our Bright Parade," it was the first

330
00:30:07,493 --> 00:30:11,493
初めてジャケットに参加した全体曲で、思い入れがあって。
group song with me on the cover, so I'm attached to it.

331
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:14,393
一人で歌うのは緊張したし、
Singing it alone made me nervous,

332
00:30:14,393 --> 00:30:17,393
声震えてませんでした？大丈夫だったかな？
and was my voice shaking? I hope it was okay.

333
00:30:17,493 --> 00:30:20,793
「この空がトリガー」はイコラブさんの曲で、
"Kono Sora ga Trigger" is an =LOVE song,

334
00:30:20,793 --> 00:30:24,493
ザ・王道アイドル！って感じの曲なんですが、
and it's such a classic idol song,

335
00:30:24,493 --> 00:30:26,593
似合ってたかな？
did it suit me?

336
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:28,493
ね、似合ってた？どうだった？
Did it suit me? How was it?

337
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,093
どうだった？
How was it?

338
00:30:30,093 --> 00:30:33,093
そして「サラバ、愛しき悲しみたちよ」、
And about "Farewell, My Dear Sorrows",

339
00:30:33,193 --> 00:30:37,093
ホロックスって戦隊モノ感ありません？
doesn't HoloX have a Sentai (superhero) vibe?

340
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:41,293
あのヘルメットのせいかもしれないけど、
Maybe it's because of that helmet, but anyway,

341
00:30:41,293 --> 00:30:47,393
戦隊モノっぽい曲を歌って踊りたいなと思ってて。
I've always wanted to sing and dance to a Sentai-style song.

342
00:30:47,393 --> 00:30:48,893
どうでしたか？
What did you think?

343
00:30:48,893 --> 00:30:51,393
似合ってた？最高だった？ありがとう！
Did it suit me? It was the best? Thank you!

344
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:54,693
ね、わかるよね？わかるよね？同じ、わかるよね？
You get it, right? We're on the same page!

345
00:30:54,693 --> 00:30:58,293
やっぱそう思ったんですよね。自分的にも...
I thought so too. Personally, I think...

346
00:30:58,293 --> 00:31:01,493
似合ってて、いい感じにできたんじゃないかな。
it suited me and went pretty well.

347
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:03,293
ではですね、
So then,

348
00:31:03,293 --> 00:31:05,193
そう、あのヘルメットね。ではですね、
right, that helmet. Anyway,

349
00:31:05,193 --> 00:31:08,593
ちょっと何か、変なぽよぽよ感というか、
that weird floaty feeling, or rather,

350
00:31:08,593 --> 00:31:11,793
酔いも落ち着いてきたような感じがしますし、
my dizziness seems to have settled down,

351
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:15,593
このあとも引き続きゲストパート行きたいと思いますので、
so we'll continue with the guest segment now.

352
00:31:15,593 --> 00:31:18,493
応援よろしくお願いします！
Please keep cheering us on!

353
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:21,893
みんな、よらちゃんだよ！
Everyone, it's Yorachan!

354
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:23,793
では。
Here we go.

355
00:31:43,093 --> 00:31:46,093
黒い羊
Black Sheep

356
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:05,493
信号は青なのか それとも緑なのか どっちなんだ?
Is the traffic light blue, or is it green? Which one is it?

357
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:09,993
あやふやなものは はっきりさせたい
I want to make vague things clear

358
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:14,393
夕暮れの商店街の 雑踏を通り抜けるのが面倒で
It's such a hassle to walk through the evening shopping district crowds

359
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:18,993
踏切を渡って 遠回りして帰る
So I cross the tracks and take the long way home

360
00:32:19,493 --> 00:32:23,793
放課後の教室は苦手だ その場にいるだけで分かり合えてるようで
I hate classrooms after school, as if just being there means we understand each other

361
00:32:23,893 --> 00:32:28,493
話し合いにならないし 白けてしまった僕は無口になる
No one really talks, and once things get cold, I just shut up

362
00:32:28,593 --> 00:32:35,793
言いたいこと言い合って 解決しようなんて 楽天的すぎるよ
Saying we can solve everything just by talking... that's way too optimistic

363
00:32:37,393 --> 00:32:41,393
誰かがため息をついた
Somebody let out a sigh

364
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:46,593
そう それが本当の声だろう
Yeah, that's probably their real voice

365
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:51,393
黒い羊 そうだ 僕だけがいなくなればいいんだ
Black sheep, that's right... everything would be fine if only I was gone

366
00:32:51,393 --> 00:32:56,293
そうすれば 止まってた針はまた動き出すんだろ?
Then the clock hands that stopped would start moving again, wouldn't they?

367
00:32:56,393 --> 00:33:00,393
全員が納得する そんな
A solution that everyone

368
00:33:00,393 --> 00:33:05,293
答えなんかあるものか
would be happy with? As if such a thing exists

369
00:33:05,793 --> 00:33:10,093
反対が僕だけなら いっそ無視すればいいんだ
If I'm the only one against it, just ignore me already

370
00:33:10,093 --> 00:33:14,893
みんなから説得される方が居心地悪くなる
Being persuaded by everyone just makes me feel more uncomfortable

371
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:19,393
目配せしてる仲間にゃ
To my comrades who exchange glances

372
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:24,093
僕は厄介者でしかない
I'm nothing but a nuisance

373
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:27,493
真っ白な群れに 悪目立ちしてる
I stand out in the pure white herd

374
00:33:27,493 --> 00:33:30,293
自分だけが 真っ黒な羊
I'm the only jet-black sheep

375
00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:34,093
と言ったって同じ色に 染まりたくないんだ
Even if they say that, I don't want to be dyed the same color

376
00:33:34,293 --> 00:33:38,293
薄暗い部屋の灯りを つけるタイミングって一体いつなんだ?
When exactly is the right time to turn on the light in a dim room?

377
00:33:38,293 --> 00:33:42,893
スマホには愛のない 過去だけが残ってる
In my smartphone, only a past without love remains

378
00:33:43,093 --> 00:33:47,393
人間関係の答え合わせなんか 特にできもしないし
I can't even double-check the answers to human relationships

379
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:52,293
そこにいなければよかったと 後悔する
I just regret that I shouldn't have been there

380
00:33:52,493 --> 00:33:57,493
実際の大半は 思うようにはいかなくて
In reality, most things don't go the way you want

381
00:33:57,893 --> 00:34:02,393
納得できないことばかりだし 諦めろと諭されてきたけど
It's all things I can't accept, though I've been told to just give up

382
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:09,193
それならやっぱ 納得なんかしないまま その度に何度も唾を吐いて
If that's the case, I'll refuse to accept it and spit at it every single time

383
00:34:09,293 --> 00:34:12,193
噛み付いちゃいけませんか?
Is it wrong for me to bite back?

384
00:34:12,393 --> 00:34:15,693
No No No No

385
00:34:15,893 --> 00:34:20,193
全部 僕のせいだ
It's all my fault

386
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:24,793
黒い羊 そうだ 僕だけがいなくなればいいんだ
Black sheep, that's right... everything would be fine if only I was gone

387
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:29,693
そうすれば 止まってた針はまた動き出すんだろ?
Then the clock hands that stopped would start moving again, wouldn't they?

388
00:34:29,793 --> 00:34:33,693
全員が納得する そんな
A solution that everyone

389
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:38,593
答えなんかあるものか
would be happy with? As if such a thing exists

390
00:34:39,193 --> 00:34:43,493
反対が僕だけなら いっそ無視すればいいんだ
If I'm the only one against it, just ignore me already

391
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:48,393
みんなから説得される方が居心地悪くなる
Being persuaded by everyone just makes me feel more uncomfortable

392
00:34:48,393 --> 00:34:52,793
目配せしてる仲間にゃ
To my comrades who exchange glances

393
00:34:52,793 --> 00:34:57,493
僕は厄介者でしかない
I'm nothing but a nuisance

394
00:34:57,693 --> 00:34:59,693
分かってるよ
I know that

395
00:35:19,505 --> 00:35:23,205
白い羊なんて僕は絶対なりたくないんだ
I absolutely never want to be a white sheep

396
00:35:23,305 --> 00:35:29,605
そうなった瞬間に僕は僕じゃなくなってしまうよ
The moment that happens, I'll stop being myself

397
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:32,505
周りと違う
Because of being different from those around me

398
00:35:32,605 --> 00:35:39,005
そのことで誰かに迷惑かけたか?
Have I caused anyone any trouble?

399
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:43,105
髪の毛を染めろという大人は何が気に食わない?
What do the adults who tell me to dye my hair dislike so much?

400
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:48,405
反逆の象徴にでもなるとでも思っているのか?
Do they think I'll become a symbol of rebellion or something?

401
00:35:48,505 --> 00:35:51,205
自分の色
My own color

402
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:57,705
とは違う それだけで厄介ものか OH
Is different, does that alone make me a nuisance? OH

403
00:35:58,805 --> 00:36:02,605
自らの真実を捨て白い羊のフリをする者よ
Those who discard their own truth and pretend to be white sheep

404
00:36:02,705 --> 00:36:06,405
黒い羊を見つけ指を指して笑うのか
Will you find the black sheep and point and laugh?

405
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:09,405
それならば僕はいつだって
If that's the case, then I'll always

406
00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:11,905
それでも僕はいつだって
Even so, I'll always

407
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:16,305
ここで悪目立ちしてよう
Stay right here and stand out like a sore thumb

408
00:36:58,105 --> 00:37:08,105

Cosmic Float

The bright, shining timbre

416
00:37:46,605 --> 00:37:49,805
おいで 誘い出すよ
Come, I'll lead the way

00:39:43,205 --> 00:39:44,305
Planet Love!

445
00:39:50,105 --> 00:39:52,005
Swing! Swing! Swing! Yeah!

446
00:39:57,705 --> 00:40:00,105
退屈にコズミックパーティ
A cosmic party for boredom

447
00:40:05,217 --> 00:40:06,717
Swing! Swing! Swing! Yeah!

448
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:16,117
曖昧に揺れたいフィーリン
I want to sway in ambiguity, that's my feelin'

449
00:40:29,117 --> 00:40:32,517
クロノスタシス
Chronostasis

451
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:35,517
コンビニエンスストアで 5 am エネルの缶ビール買って
At the convenience store at 5 AM, buying a can of beer...

452
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:41,417
君と夜の散歩 時計の針は12時を指してる
A night walk with you, the clock hands point to 12.

453
00:40:41,417 --> 00:40:46,917
クロノスタシスって知ってる？ 知らないと君が言う
"Do you know what chronostasis is?" you ask, "I don't."

454
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:52,617
時計の針が止まって見える 現象のことだよ
It's the phenomenon where the clock hands appear to stop.

455
00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:09,717
ホリデイズ・ミッドナイト 少し汗ばんだ
Holidays Midnight, a little sweaty...

456
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:15,417
手のひらが子供みたいな体温
My palms have the temperature of a child's.

457
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:21,117
誰も知らない場所に行きたい 誰も知らない秘密を知りたい
I want to go somewhere no one knows, I want to know secrets no one knows.

458
00:41:21,117 --> 00:41:26,917
街灯の下で君の髪が
Under the streetlight, your hair...

459
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:32,517
ゆらゆら揺れて 夢のようで見惚れて
Gently swaying, I'm entranced as if in a dream.

460
00:41:32,517 --> 00:41:38,317
ゆらゆら揺れて 溶かしている
Gently swaying, melting into it.

461
00:41:41,117 --> 00:41:46,717
ホリデイズ・ミッドナイト 今夜だけ忘れてよ
Holidays Midnight, just for tonight, forget...

462
00:41:46,717 --> 00:41:50,217
家まで帰る道
...the way back home.

463
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:56,617
なんかさ ちょっとさ いい感じ
Somehow, it feels a little nice.

464
00:41:56,617 --> 00:42:02,217
街灯の下で君の影が
Under the streetlight, your shadow...

465
00:42:02,217 --> 00:42:07,817
ゆらゆら揺れて 夢のようで見惚れて
Gently swaying, I'm entranced as if in a dream.

466
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:13,417
ゆらゆら揺れて 溶かしている
Gently swaying, melting into it.

467
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:18,917
歩く速度が違うから BPM 84 に合わせて
Because our walking speeds are different, I match the BPM of 84...

468
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:24,517
君と夜の散歩 それ以上何も言わないで
...and take a night walk with you. Please don't say anything more.

469
00:42:24,517 --> 00:42:30,117
クロノスタシスって知ってる？ 知らないと君が言う
"Do you know what chronostasis is?" you ask, "I don't."

470
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:35,817
時計の針が止まって見える 現象のことだよ
It's the phenomenon where the clock hands appear to stop.

471
00:42:58,417 --> 00:43:04,117
ゆらゆら揺れて 夢のようで見惚れて
Gently swaying, I'm entranced as if in a dream.

472
00:43:04,117 --> 00:43:13,117
ゆらゆら揺れて 溶かしている
Gently swaying, melting into it.

473
00:43:13,117 --> 00:43:18,917
コンビニエンスストアで 5 am エネルの缶ビール買って
At the convenience store at 5 AM, buying a can of beer...

474
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:24,417
君と夜の散歩 時計の針は12時を指してる
A night walk with you, the clock hands point to 12.

475
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:30,117
クロノスタシスって知ってる？ 知らないと君が言う
"Do you know what chronostasis is?" you ask, "I don't."

時計の針が止まって見える 現象のことだよ
It's the phenomenon where the clock hands appear to stop.

477
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:41,417
ララハ...
La-la-ha...

478
00:44:26,617 --> 00:44:30,417
いぇーい！みんな、どうだった？ 楽しんでくれましたか？
Yay! Everyone, how was it? Did you enjoy it?

479
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:34,917
なんか、後ろにいる変なのも一緒に楽しんでくれてたみたいで
It seems like that weird thing behind me was also enjoying it.

480
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:39,517
めちゃめちゃ自己主張激しくてすみません。ちょっと見苦しかったと思うんですけど。
Sorry it was so self-assertive, it must have been a bit of an eyesore.

481
00:44:39,517 --> 00:44:44,317
はい。なんか変な感じするね。頭がぼーっとするような。
Yes... I feel kind of strange. Like my head is fuzzy.

482
00:44:44,317 --> 00:44:47,517
あのキノコが悪かったのかな？
Was it because of that mushroom?

483
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:51,417
さっき変なキノコ食べちゃったんですけど、みんなも拾い食いダメだよ。
I ate a weird mushroom earlier, but you guys shouldn't scavenge for food!

484
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:55,317
道端から拾って食べちゃダメだからね。
Don't pick up things from the side of the road and eat them.

485
00:44:55,317 --> 00:45:00,117
ということで、まだまだライブは続きます。沙花叉、これからも頑張って歌って...
And with that, the live concert continues. Chloe's going to keep doing her best singing...

486
00:45:00,129 --> 00:45:02,477
全力で踊りますので 応援よろしくお願いします！
I'll be dancing with all my might, so please support me!

487
00:45:02,797 --> 00:45:05,277
よっしゃーいくぞー！
Alright, let's go!

488
00:45:05,629 --> 00:45:06,729
ということで。
So then.

489
00:45:07,029 --> 00:45:11,109
それでは、歌わせていただきたいと思います。
Now, I'd like to sing.

490
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:13,329
アイドル！
Idol!

491
00:45:17,069 --> 00:45:19,589
無敵の笑顔で荒らすメディア
Stirring up the media with an invincible smile

Lyrics & Composition: Ayase

493
00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:22,549
知りたいその秘密ミステリアス
Wanna know her secret, so mysterious

494
00:45:22,749 --> 00:45:25,269
抜けてるところさえ彼女のエリア
Even her flaws are part of her charm

495
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:28,229
完璧で嘘つきな君は
You are a perfect, lying...

496
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:30,629
天才的なアイドル様
genius idol

497
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:36,629
今日何食べた？ 好きな本は？
What did you eat today? What's your favorite book?

498
00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:39,529
遊びに行くならどこに行くの？
If you were to go out, where would you go?

499
00:45:39,729 --> 00:45:41,929
何も食べてない それは内緒
I haven't eaten anything. That's a secret.

500
00:45:42,129 --> 00:45:45,429
何を聞かれてものらりくらり
Whatever I'm asked, I just dodge and weave.

501
00:45:45,629 --> 00:45:48,429
そう淡々と だけど燦々と
So coolly, yet so brilliantly

502
00:45:48,629 --> 00:45:51,429
見えそうで見えない秘密は蜜の味
The secrets that seem visible but aren't, taste like honey.

503
00:45:51,629 --> 00:45:53,729
あれもないないない これもないないない
Not that, no, no, no. Not this, no, no, no.

504
00:45:53,929 --> 00:45:57,229
好きなタイプは？ 相手は？ さあ答えて
What's your type? Who's the person? Come on, answer me!

505
00:45:57,429 --> 00:46:00,229
「誰かを好きになるなんて私分からなくてさ」
“I don't really know what it's like to fall in love with someone.”

506
00:46:03,229 --> 00:46:06,229
嘘か本当か知り得ない そんな言葉に
To those words, whether they're lies or the truth, no one can know,

507
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:09,229
また一人堕ちる また好きにさせる
Another person falls, made to love you again.

508
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:14,429
誰もが目を奪われていく
Everyone finds their eyes stolen away

509
00:46:14,629 --> 00:46:17,429
君は完璧で究極のアイドル
By you, the perfect and ultimate idol

510
00:46:17,629 --> 00:46:20,429
金劫際現れない
A star that will never appear again,

511
00:46:20,629 --> 00:46:23,629
一番星の生まれ変わり
The reincarnation of the brightest star.

512
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:26,629
ああ その笑顔で「愛してる」で
Ah, with that smile, with an "I love you,"

513
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:30,129
誰も彼も虜にしていく
You captivate everyone and anyone.

514
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:33,429
その瞳が その言葉が
Those eyes, those words,

515
00:46:33,629 --> 00:46:36,629
嘘でもそれは完全な愛
Even if they're lies, they're perfect love.

516
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:39,429
はいはいあの子は特別です
Yes, yes, that girl is special.

517
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:41,529
我々は端からおまけです
We are just extras from the start.

518
00:46:41,729 --> 00:46:44,329
お星様の引き立て役Bです
We're just Supporting Role B, there to make the star shine.

519
00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:46,929
全てがあの子のおかげな
Everything is thanks to that girl—

520
00:46:47,129 --> 00:46:49,229
わけない 洒落臭い 妬み嫉妬なんてないわけがない
As if! How annoying. There's no way there's no envy or jealousy.

521
00:46:49,429 --> 00:46:52,129
これはネタじゃない からこそ許せない
This isn't a joke, which is exactly why it's unforgivable.

522
00:46:52,329 --> 00:46:53,429
完璧じゃない君じゃ許せない
I can't forgive you if you're not perfect.

523
00:46:53,629 --> 00:46:54,729
自分を許せない
I can't forgive myself.

524
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:58,329
誰よりも強い君以外は認めない
I won't acknowledge anyone but you, who are stronger than anyone.

525
00:46:58,529 --> 00:47:00,929
誰もが信じ崇めてる
Everyone believes and worships you.

526
00:47:01,129 --> 00:47:03,929
まさに最強で無敵のアイドル
Truly the strongest and invincible idol.

527
00:47:04,129 --> 00:47:06,729
弱点なんて見当たらない
No weaknesses can be found.

528
00:47:06,929 --> 00:47:09,929
一番星を宿している
You harbor the brightest star.

529
00:47:10,129 --> 00:47:13,229
弱いとこなんて見せちゃダメダメ
You must never, ever show your weak points.

530
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:15,629
知りたくないとこは見せずに
Without showing the parts people don't want to know,

531
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:19,429
唯一無二じゃなくちゃイヤイヤ
You must be one of a kind, or it's no good.

532
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:22,629
それこそ本物の愛
That's what true love is.

533
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:25,129
特意の笑顔で沸かすメディア
Boiling up the media with your signature smile.

534
00:47:25,329 --> 00:47:27,929
隠しきるこの秘密だけは
Just this secret, I'll keep it hidden forever.

535
00:47:28,129 --> 00:47:30,929
「愛してる」って嘘で積むキャリア
A career built on the lie of "I love you."

536
00:47:31,129 --> 00:47:34,629
これこそ私なりの愛だ
This is my own kind of love.

537
00:47:34,829 --> 00:47:37,529
流れる汗も綺麗なアクア
The sweat that flows is a beautiful aqua.

538
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:40,529
ルビーを隠したこの瞼
These eyelids that hide rubies.

539
00:47:40,729 --> 00:47:44,329
歌い踊り舞う私はマリア
Singing, dancing, and soaring, I am Maria.

540
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:47,429
そう嘘はとびきりの愛だ
Yes, lies are the ultimate love.

541
00:47:48,429 --> 00:47:51,229
誰かに愛されたことも
Having never been loved by anyone,

542
00:47:51,429 --> 00:47:54,729
誰かのこと愛したこともない
Nor having ever loved anyone,

543
00:47:54,929 --> 00:47:58,029
そんな私の嘘がいつか
Those lies of mine, I hope that someday

544
00:47:58,229 --> 00:48:00,729
本当になること信じてる
They will become the truth.

545
00:48:02,429 --> 00:48:05,229
いつかきっと全部手に入れる
Someday, I'll surely get it all.

546
00:48:05,429 --> 00:48:08,429
私はそう欲張りなアイドル
I'm a greedy idol like that.

547
00:48:08,629 --> 00:48:11,429
等身大でみんなのこと
In my true self, I want to properly

548
00:48:11,629 --> 00:48:14,429
ちゃんと愛したいから
Love everyone,

549
00:48:14,629 --> 00:48:17,429
今日も嘘をつくの
So I'll tell lies again today.

550
00:48:17,629 --> 00:48:20,529
この言葉がいつか本当になる日を願って
Wishing for the day these words will someday come true.

551
00:48:20,729 --> 00:48:23,129
それでもまだ
Even so,

552
00:48:23,329 --> 00:48:26,629
君と君にだけは言えずにいたけど
I still couldn't say it to you and only you,

553
00:48:27,229 --> 00:48:29,929
ああ やっと言えた
Ah, I finally said it.

554
00:48:30,129 --> 00:48:32,529
これは絶対嘘じゃない
This is definitely not a lie.

555
00:48:32,729 --> 00:48:34,129
「愛してる」
“I love you.”

557
00:49:11,529 --> 00:49:14,029
繋いだ真っ赤な糸が
The bright red thread connecting us

558
00:49:14,229 --> 00:49:19,229
嬉しくてよしよししちゃう
Makes me so happy, I want to pet you

559
00:49:19,429 --> 00:49:22,129
どこにも行かないように縛って
Tie you up so you can't go anywhere

560
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:24,529
ほら私だけに寄り添って
Look, just stay close to me

561
00:49:24,729 --> 00:49:27,529
良い子に出来てたのにな
I was being such a good girl

562
00:49:27,729 --> 00:49:30,329
よそ見とべったり手垢
Looking away and covered in sticky handprints.

563
00:49:30,529 --> 00:49:34,129
今すぐ洗わなきゃ
I have to wash them off right now.

564
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:36,629
誰になでなでされたのバッチィね
Who gave you pets? How dirty.

565
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:39,229
愛のメトロノーム増して
The metronome of love is speeding up,

566
00:49:39,429 --> 00:49:42,329
フレフレして見せてよ 期待の
So show me your wagging tail, just as I expect.

567
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:46,629
どうしちゃったの？ 絶対絶対絶対好きでしょ？
What's wrong? You definitely, definitely, definitely love me, right?

568
00:49:46,829 --> 00:49:49,229
どうしちゃったの？ いっぱいいっぱいいっぱい愛して
What's wrong? Love me more, more, more.

569
00:49:49,429 --> 00:49:51,929
私だけの君じゃなきゃ
If you're not mine and mine alone,

570
00:49:52,129 --> 00:49:53,429
ねえ嫌だよ
Hey, I won't like it.

571
00:49:53,629 --> 00:49:54,529
ねえ君は
Hey, you,

572
00:49:54,729 --> 00:49:57,229
ねえ誰に懐いてるんだろう
Hey, who are you becoming attached to?

573
00:49:57,429 --> 00:50:01,129
どうしちゃったの？ 絶対絶対絶対好きでしょ？
What's wrong? You definitely, definitely, definitely love me, right?

574
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:01,441
大好きでしょ
You love it, right?

575
00:50:01,441 --> 00:50:05,441
どうしちゃったの いっぱい いっぱい いっぱい 愛して
What's wrong? Love me more and more and more.

576
00:50:05,441 --> 00:50:08,641
私だけの君じゃなきゃね 嫌だよ
It's no good if you're not mine alone.

577
00:50:08,641 --> 00:50:12,441
ねぇ 君は ねぇ 誰になついてるんだろう
Hey, who are you getting attached to?

578
00:50:12,441 --> 00:50:16,341
ねぇ 私が君にあげた首輪はしたまま
Hey, keep on the collar I gave you.

579
00:50:30,941 --> 00:50:34,141
おはようってキスをしたら
If we kiss and say good morning...

580
00:50:34,141 --> 00:50:37,941
さわり合って 二人の時間
Touching each other, our time together.

581
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:40,441
なーのに私だけじゃ足りないの？
But am I not enough on my own?

582
00:50:40,441 --> 00:50:42,641
これが俗に言う 執着か
Is this what's commonly called obsession?

583
00:50:42,641 --> 00:50:45,441
あいつがいけないんだね
It's that person's fault, isn't it?

584
00:50:45,941 --> 00:50:49,141
アドレからの通知音 忍び音

Even though it's my own song, I can't say it right every time...

あの、めちゃめちゃ沙花叉はこの曲が大好きでして、キャッチーだし、ちょっと、なんて言うんですかね、
Um, I really, really love this song.
It's catchy and, how should I put it...

750
01:03:26,865 --> 01:03:32,631
ダークさが本当にあからさまに分かりやすく出てるんですけど、それを曲調でも隠してるっていうところがまた、
the darkness is really obvious and easy to understand,
but it's also hidden within the melody,

751
01:03:32,631 --> 01:03:35,531
ちょっと二面性があっていいなと思っているんで、
which gives it a nice duality.

752
01:03:35,531 --> 01:03:40,131
このなんかさ、見て！ステージとかもさ、猛毒に合いそうでしょ？めちゃめちゃいい感じにできたんじゃないかなと思っているんですよ。
And look at this! Doesn't the stage look
like it suits "Moudoku" too? I think it turned out great.

753
01:03:42,665 --> 01:03:43,931
見てみてー！
Take a look!

754
01:03:44,898 --> 01:03:48,498
はい、猛毒もですね、MVが出たらぜひ聞いてほしいなと思うし、リリースも楽しみに待っててください！
Yes, I hope you'll listen to "Moudoku" when the MV is out,
