Oh iya belum. Gajah!

Gajah nggak ada sih.
There's no elephant.

00:26:11,581 --> 00:26:12,781
Oh gitu.

But seriously, I want to see first, what's in here?

504
00:31:28,593 --> 00:31:31,593
見つめ合って 恋をして
Looking at each other, falling in love

505
00:31:31,893 --> 00:31:34,893
無我夢中で 追いかけて
Chasing frantically

506
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:40,593
だけど もっと知りたくて メラメラしてる
But I want to know more, I'm burning up

507
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:43,893

With a face as honest as my wishes

誰でも 信じるけど
Anyone would believe in them

513
00:32:00,093 --> 00:32:05,093
そこそこ 攻めなきゃつまらないよ
But it's boring if you don't push the limits

光るほど 影はでき
The more it shines, the more shadows form

523
00:32:59,593 --> 00:33:02,593
燃えるほど 灰になる

The more I run, the more I see this dangerous life

619
00:41:02,517 --> 00:41:08,417
出会いはふとした瞬間 帰り道の交差点で
Our meeting was a sudden moment, at a crossroad on the way home

620
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:14,717
声をかけてくれたね 「一緒に帰ろう」
You called out to me, "Let's go home together"

621
00:41:15,617 --> 00:41:21,517
僕は照れくさそうに カバンで顔を隠しながら
Embarrassed, I hid my face behind my bag

622
00:41:22,017 --> 00:41:28,117
本当はとてもとても 嬉しかったよ
But really, I was so, so happy

623
00:41:28,617 --> 00:41:34,617
あぁ 花火が夜空綺麗に咲いて ちょっと切なく
Ah, fireworks bloomed beautifully in the night sky, a little bittersweet

624
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:41,417
あぁ 風が時間とともに流れる
Ah, the wind flows along with time

625
00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:48,117
嬉しくて 楽しくて 冒険もいろいろしたね
It was happy and fun, we had all sorts of adventures

626
00:41:48,617 --> 00:41:54,617
二人の 秘密の 基地の中
Inside our secret base

631
00:42:09,217 --> 00:42:15,617
君が最後まで心から 「ありがとう」叫んでいたこと 知っていたよ
I knew you were shouting "Thank you" from the bottom of your heart until the end

632
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:22,117
涙をこらえて 笑顔でさよなら 切ないよね

あぁ 太陽と月仲良くして
Ah, the sun and moon get along well

636
00:42:42,317 --> 00:42:48,217
楽しくて 寂しくて 喧嘩もいろいろしたね
It was fun and lonely, we had all sorts of fights

突然の 転校で
Because of a sudden school transfer

00:43:22,217 --> 00:43:32,517
どうしようもなくて
There was nothing I could do

643
00:43:33,317 --> 00:43:40,917
手紙書くよ 電話もするよ 忘れないでね 僕のことを
I'll write letters, I'll call you, please don't forget me

646
00:43:55,317 --> 00:44:01,417
君の頬を流れた涙はずっと忘れない
I'll never forget the tears that flowed down your cheeks

647
00:44:02,217 --> 00:44:08,517
君が最後まで大きく手を振ってくれたこと ずっと忘れない
I'll never forget how you waved your hand so much until the very end

648
00:44:09,017 --> 00:44:14,917
だからこうして夢の中で ずっと永遠に

672
00:46:15,929 --> 00:46:18,129
Kalian, kalian pilih lagu-lagu ini kenapa sih?
You guys, why did you choose these songs?

673
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:21,129
Hmm... Kalau tadi tuh yang pertama banget ya...

What song was it? "Start:Dash!!"...

675
00:46:28,229 --> 00:46:29,929

676
00:46:30,129 --> 00:46:33,329
Oh my god, bestie kita Pioneerrr!
Oh my god, bestie, we are Pioneer!

677
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:34,329
Masa sih?
Really?

678
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:37,129
Tahu nggak sih, Risu bela-belain belajar dance!
Do you know, Risu went through
the trouble of learning the dance!

679
00:46:37,129 --> 00:46:39,029
My god, kalian harus tahu!
My god, you guys have to know!

680
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:43,129
Jadi, kalian kalau nyadar ya,
di showcase-nya Risu, dia nggak ada nge-dance.
So, if you notice, in Risu's showcase,
she didn't dance.

681
00:46:43,129 --> 00:46:44,329
Iya.
Yes.

682
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:49,129
Iya, pas ini kita: "Risu, kamu nggak mau tahu, nge-dance!"
Yes, this time we said:
"Risu, like it or not, you're dancing!"

683
00:46:50,929 --> 00:46:53,129
Ini Risu, Yopi mau terima seriusan dikit ya.
For Risu, Iofi wants to be a bit serious.

684
00:46:53,129 --> 00:46:55,629
Kalian kalau mau nangis, nangis aja semua.
If you want to cry, just cry, everyone.

685
00:46:55,629 --> 00:47:00,129
Jadi, yang nggak biasa nge-dance itu
di antara kita bertiga itu Risu...
So, the one who's not used to dancing
among the three of us is Risu...

686
00:47:00,129 --> 00:47:06,129
...karena kayak kita, Risu, Start:Dash!! kui-kui
dia awalnya cuma kayak nyanyi doang...
...because like us, Risu, for "Start:Dash!!",
at first she was just like singing...

687
00:47:06,129 --> 00:47:09,129
Ah, bisa kayak nyanyi doang gitu. Ternyata...
Ah, I thought I could just sing. Turns out...

688
00:47:09,629 --> 00:47:13,129
Ternyata... Bagaimana kalau kita nge-dance? Wah!
Turns out... How about we dance? Wah!

689
00:47:13,129 --> 00:47:16,129
Risu kayak "Hah?", terus Moona bilang...
Risu was like "Huh?", then Moona said...

690
00:47:16,129 --> 00:47:21,129
Kamu, kamu masuk ke dunia entertainment, idol, hololive...
You, you entered the entertainment world, idols, hololive...

691
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:24,629
Saatnya kamu belajar dance.
It's time for you to learn to dance.

692
00:47:25,129 --> 00:47:26,629

693
00:47:26,629 --> 00:47:28,129
Iya, gitu. Isimi, tahu nggak?
Yeah, like that. Isimi, you know?

694
00:47:28,129 --> 00:47:30,929
Awalnya, awalnya Risu nggak bisa banget, guys.
At first, at first Risu couldn't do it at all, guys.

695
00:47:31,129 --> 00:47:34,129
Sekarang udah bisa. Kalian lihat kan tadi? Hebat!

696
00:47:34,129 --> 00:47:35,629

697
00:47:35,629 --> 00:47:38,329
Tadi tuh last minute kita sempet-sempet latihan juga.

We practiced for a long time.
We practiced while being watched by Yagoo, you know?

700
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:47,929
Kata Yagoo: "Ganbatte ne, minna.
Ganbatte ne, minna," katanya.
Yagoo said: "Good luck, everyone.
Good luck, everyone," he said.

701
00:47:48,129 --> 00:47:51,629
Sampai-sampai Moona bilang: "Yagoo, TONIGHT, IDOL!"
To the point Moona said: "Yagoo, TONIGHT, IDOL!"

702
00:47:51,629 --> 00:47:53,629
Hebat bukan?
Isn't it great?

703
00:47:53,629 --> 00:47:56,629
TONIGHT, IDOL! TONIGHT, IDOL!

704

The tail, the tail at the waist can't be raised.

726
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:20,629
Ayo pinggangmu! Pinggangmu!
Come on, your waist! Your waist!

727
00:49:20,629 --> 00:49:22,629
Emang dari sananya!
It's like that from the start!

728
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:26,629
Terus, terus, ada apa lagi?
Then, then, what else is there?

729
00:49:26,629 --> 00:49:30,129
Atau mau nyanyi dulu? Jelasin dulu deh. Oke.
Or want to sing first? Explain first. Okay.

730
00:49:30,129 --> 00:49:36,629
So this is a 3D Acrylic Stand special with our 3D model and with our pose...

731
00:49:36,629 --> 00:49:42,129
...because usually when we only have 2D models we don't really have any dynamic poses.

732
00:49:42,629 --> 00:49:44,329
For this is the first time.

733
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:48,629
Yes, this is the first time. This is the first time
we have like literal dynamic, man, look at the pose!

734
00:49:48,629 --> 00:49:51,129
Look at the pose! Pose! Pose!

735
00:49:51,129 --> 00:49:54,329
Nah, kayak gitu. Misalkan aku kayak gini kali ya.
So, like that. For example, I'm like this, I guess.

736
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:58,329
Aku kayak gini. Oh Yopi yang gini kayaknya.
I'm like this. Oh, Iofi is like this, I think.

737
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:01,522
Waduh, ini keren banget!
Wow, this is so cool!

738
00:50:01,522 --> 00:50:02,303
Tapi...
But...

739
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:04,105
Tapi gak cuma ini lho.
But it's not just this.

740
00:50:04,105 --> 00:50:05,246
Oh, ada lagi?
Oh, there's more?

741
00:50:05,246 --> 00:50:07,648
Not just this, we have another one!

742
00:50:07,648 --> 00:50:08,549
Yes!

743
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:09,450
What is it?

744
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:10,351
Apa lagi nih?
What else is there?

745
00:50:10,351 --> 00:50:15,291
Jyan jyan jyan!
Ta-da!

746
00:50:15,561 --> 00:50:17,541
Jadi temen-temen...
So, friends...

747
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:20,641
There are three special items.

748
00:50:21,141 --> 00:50:24,441
"Everyone's Best Friends, Risusaurus" - Plushie

749
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:26,641
And "My Bestfriend Moomo" - Plushie

750
00:50:26,641 --> 00:50:30,141
And "Kyawaii Chiyopi" - Plushie

751
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:32,041
Let's go, let's go!

752
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:33,941
Ah, ini dia! Look at this!
Ah, here it is! Look at this!

753
00:50:33,941 --> 00:50:36,141
Ini kecilnya segini lho.
It's about this small.

754
00:50:36,141 --> 00:50:38,641
Jadi nih, size aslinya tuh seperti ini.
So, this is its actual size.

755
00:50:38,641 --> 00:50:40,141
So this is the real size of it.

756
00:50:40,141 --> 00:50:42,641
You can see the size on the screen, right?

757
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:48,641
So there's a reason why we show this on our 3D showcase.

758
00:50:49,141 --> 00:50:54,141
Because we want to let you know how cute our plushie is.

759
00:50:54,941 --> 00:50:58,641
And this is Chiyopi, this is Yopi.

760
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:00,141
This is Yopi.

761
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:01,441
Ah, this is Yopi!

00:51:02,641 --> 00:51:04,141
This is Yopi!

764
00:51:04,141 --> 00:51:05,641
Ini gak tau siapa.
I don't know who this is.

765
00:51:05,641 --> 00:51:07,641
This is alien!
This is an alien!

766
00:51:07,641 --> 00:51:09,641
This is Chiyopi, this is Yopi.

767
00:51:09,641 --> 00:51:12,141
Chiyopi is small, Yopi is big.

768
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:13,641

798
00:53:35,141 --> 00:53:38,141

839
00:56:31,353 --> 00:56:33,353
Ioforia!

840
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:36,153
Obisa!

841
00:56:37,153 --> 00:56:43,153
Jadi teman-teman, panggung yang sudah kita impi-impikan sudah menanti.
So friends, the stage we've been dreaming of is waiting.

842
00:56:44,653 --> 00:56:47,153
You guys ready? Yes, I am ready!

843
00:56:48,653 --> 00:56:53,153
Satu, dua... id:entity voices!
One, two... id:entity voices!

844
00:56:55,153 --> 00:56:59,153
Dengarkanlah suaraku...
Listen to my voice...

845
00:57:00,153 --> 00:57:03,653
id:entity voices

846
00:57:12,153 --> 00:57:15,953
Berdiri di tengah terangnya kilas cahaya
Standing in the middle of the bright flashes of light

847
00:57:17,653 --> 00:57:22,653
Ohayou Konbanwa kami serukan kepada dunia
Good morning, good evening, we call out to the world

848
00:57:23,153 --> 00:57:26,153
Mengudara hari ini
Broadcasting today

849
00:57:26,253 --> 00:57:29,153
bagian dari diri yang manakah
which part of myself

850
00:57:29,253 --> 00:57:34,153
Yang harus kutunjukkan tak dapat pernah memutuskan
should I show, I can never decide

851
00:57:35,153 --> 00:57:39,653
Lalu suatu hari pesan-pesan berdatangan
Then one day, messages started arriving

852
00:57:40,153 --> 00:57:45,153
Kata-kata terima membuatku kehilangan arah
Those words made me lose my way

853
00:57:46,153 --> 00:57:49,153
Senyuman di balik layar
Smiles behind the screen

854
00:57:49,253 --> 00:57:51,653
sangat berarti untukku bertahan
mean a lot for me to persevere

855
00:57:52,153 --> 00:57:57,153
Tak pernah ingin mengecewakan siapapun di luar sana
Never want to disappoint anyone out there

856
00:57:58,153 --> 00:58:02,953
Namun di saat banyaknya suara
But when there are many voices

857
00:58:03,153 --> 00:58:07,653
Manakah yang harus kudengar?
Which one should I listen to?

858
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:14,153
Mencoba mendengarkan suara di dalam hati
Trying to listen to the voice inside my heart

859
00:58:14,653 --> 00:58:20,153
Inilah diri yang ingin kuselalu tunjukkan
This is the self I want to always show

860
00:58:20,653 --> 00:58:26,653
Berbagai suara yang berpadu kan menjadi satu
Various voices blending together will become one

861
00:58:27,153 --> 00:58:29,153
Identity!

862
00:58:40,153 --> 00:58:44,953
Hari-hari berlalu dan sekarang ku di sini
Days pass and now I'm here

863
00:58:45,153 --> 00:58:50,153
Berdiri di tepi panggung ini menyambut dunia
Standing at the edge of this stage welcoming the world

864
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:54,153
Tetapi ku tak sendiri
But I'm not alone

865
00:58:54,253 --> 00:58:56,653
bersama lainnya sekarang
with others now

866
00:58:57,153 --> 00:59:02,653
Seakan seperti keluarga bersatu dalam perbedaan
Like a family united in difference

867
00:59:03,153 --> 00:59:07,653
Namun di saat banyaknya perbedaan
But when there are many differences

868
00:59:08,153 --> 00:59:12,653
Dapatkah harmoni tercipta?
Can harmony be created?

869
00:59:13,153 --> 00:59:19,153
Bergandengan tangan berjuang raih mimpi bersama
Holding hands struggling to achieve dreams together

870
00:59:19,653 --> 00:59:24,653
Semua bersorak dengan suara gembira
Everyone cheering with a joyful voice

871
00:59:25,153 --> 00:59:30,153
Menyebarkan kebahagiaan
Spreading happiness

872
00:59:30,253 --> 00:59:35,153
di mana pun itu bergemuruh
wherever it rumbles

873
00:59:42,153 --> 00:59:47,153
Panggung yang lebih besar kini menunggu
A bigger stage is now waiting

874
00:59:47,653 --> 00:59:53,153
Waktunya telah tiba tanpa adanya ragu
The time has come without any doubt

875
00:59:53,653 --> 00:59:58,653
Dengan semua warna suara...
With all the colors of voice...

876
01:00:00,481 --> 01:00:02,215
Ini sebenarnya...
This is actually...

877
01:00:02,215 --> 01:00:06,748
Inilah langkah awal rasa bimbang di hati
This is the first step for the uncertainty in my heart

878
01:00:06,748 --> 01:00:13,731
Inilah jati diri yang ingin kuselalu tunjukkan
This is the identity I always want to show

879
01:00:13,731 --> 01:00:18,531
Berbagai suara yang berpadu
Various voices blending together

880
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:23,331
Dalam perbedaan takkan pernah tergoyahkan
Unyielding amidst our differences

881
01:00:23,331 --> 01:00:28,665
Dan menjadi satu id:entity
And becoming one id:entity
