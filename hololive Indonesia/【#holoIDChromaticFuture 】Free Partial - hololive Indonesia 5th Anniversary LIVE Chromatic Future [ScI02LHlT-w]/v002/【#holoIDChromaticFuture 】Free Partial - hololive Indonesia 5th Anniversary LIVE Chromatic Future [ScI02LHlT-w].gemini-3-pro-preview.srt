Wow, I really didn't expect the 5th Anniversary concert...

188
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,896
...Hololive ID ini akhirnya ada juga.
...of Hololive ID to finally happen.

189
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:00,396
Dari lagu pertama aja...
Just from the first song...

190
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:01,996
...udah keren banget guys!
...it was already so cool guys!

191
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,817
Woe, woe, woe, woe, woe!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

192
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:15,417
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

193
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:18,117
Nanti keringetan loh, nanti keringetan.
You'll get sweaty, you know. You'll get sweaty.

194
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:23,417
Kok Kaela gimana?
How about you, Kaela?

195
00:15:23,617 --> 00:15:25,117
Aduh, seru banget.
Oh my, it's so exciting.

196
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:28,117
Aku enggak nyangka sih sampai aku bisa ada di sini ya.
I never expected I'd actually be able to be here.

197
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:30,817
Tapi ini ngomong-ngomong konsernya masih panjang banget...
But speaking of which, the concert is still very long...

198
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:33,117
...jadi kalian tetap semangat ya sampai akhir!
...so you guys keep your spirits up until the end!

199
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:35,617
Semangat, semangat, semangat, semangat!
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

200
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:43,117
Eh, tapi ngomongin konser dari tadi emang pada tahu judul konsernya apa?
Eh, but speaking of the concert, do you actually know what the title is?

201
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:47,817
Judul konser kita kali ini adalah Chromatic Future!
Our concert title this time is Chromatic Future!

202
00:15:48,117 --> 00:15:51,617
Ada yang tahu enggak artinya apa? Ayo absen.
Does anyone know what it means? Come on, roll call.

203
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,117
Nah ini, Kobo paling tahu.
Well, Kobo knows this best.

204
00:15:55,617 --> 00:16:00,117
Yang... yang jelasin yang paling tinggi. Yuk, let's go.
The... the one to explain is the tallest one. Yup, let's go.

205
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:02,117
Segitu ya... ya udahlah, ya udah.
Like that, huh... alright then, alright.

206
00:16:02,617 --> 00:16:06,117
Nih ya guys ya, buat kalian yang belum tahu...
Here guys, for those of you who don't know...

207
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:09,617
...Chromatic Future itu artinya tuh masa depan yang berwarna-warni.
...Chromatic Future means a colorful future.

208
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:14,117
Jadi karena Hololive Indonesia kan udah lima tahun nih...
So, because Hololive Indonesia has been around for five years...

209
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:17,617
...kita sama-sama dari hari satu sampai sekarang.
...we've been together from day one until now.

210
00:16:17,617 --> 00:16:20,617
Nah, jadi itu untuk ke depannya...
So, for the future...

211
00:16:20,617 --> 00:16:26,617
...harapannya tuh kita bisa nyiptain waktu dan memori yang berwarna-warni...
...our hope is that we can create colorful times and memories...

212
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:29,117
...sama seluruh fans dari Hololive Indonesia!
...with all the fans of Hololive Indonesia!

213
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:31,617
Ya gitu! Betul kayak yang dibilang Kak Ela!
Just like that! Correct, just like Kaela said!

214
00:16:34,617 --> 00:16:39,617
Nah, kalian sekarang udah pada tahu kan karena tadi udah dijelasin sama Kaela.
Well, now you guys know since it was explained by Kaela.

215
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:42,117
Kalau gitu konsernya kan udah mulai nih.
In that case, the concert has already started.

216
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:46,617
Kalian mau ngepost soal konser ini di medsos...
If you want to post about this concert on social media...

217
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:51,117
...jangan lupa hashtag #holoIDChromaticFuture ya!
...don't forget the hashtag #holoIDChromaticFuture!

...pengen lihat semangat kalian!
...want to see your excitement!

220
00:17:01,617 --> 00:17:03,617
Betul banget, ya enggak?
That's right, isn't it?

221
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:05,617
Jangan typo, jangan typo!
Don't make a typo, don't make a typo!

222
00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:09,117
Asik, share ke semua oke?
Cool, share it with everyone, okay?

223
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:15,617
Jujur deh, kalian tuh pas dibilang kita bakal konser lho di Indonesia...
Be honest, when you were told we were going to have a concert in Indonesia...

224
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,617
...kalian pada kaget enggak sih?
...were you guys surprised?

225
00:17:21,617 --> 00:17:25,617
Betul, aku setuju juga. Aku merasakan empati.
Correct, I agree too. I feel the empathy.

226
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:35,617
Aku juga waktu itu enggak nyangka banget kayak 'Hah? Beneran? Ini real nih?'
I also really didn't expect it at that time, like 'Huh? For real? Is this real?'

227
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:39,617
Kayak 'Loh? Bisa gitu?'
Like 'Whoa? It can be like that?'

228
00:17:39,617 --> 00:17:42,617
Akhirnya mana udah bersembilan di Indonesia pula ya kan.
Finally, and all nine of us are in Indonesia too.

229
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:51,617
Ini kan konser pertama Hololive Indonesia yang bersembilan.
This is the first Hololive Indonesia concert with all nine members.

230
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:56,617
Sebenarnya tuh enggak hanya ini tuh momen terbesar dan terpenting juga...
Actually, this isn't just the biggest and most important moment...

231
00:17:56,617 --> 00:18:00,117
...untuk fans Hololive Indonesia...
...for Hololive Indonesia fans...

232
00:18:00,117 --> 00:18:03,617
...tapi seluruh dunia juga pasti bakal nonton enggak sih?
...but the whole world will definitely be watching too, right?

233
00:18:10,617 --> 00:18:14,617
Tentu aja, ini pencapaiannya enggak bakal cuma sampai di sini aja kan.
Of course, this achievement won't just stop here.

234
00:18:14,617 --> 00:18:18,617
Jadi next-nya mungkin kita bisa apa ya...
So for the next one, maybe we can, what was it...

235
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:21,617
...dominating the world! Gitu!
...dominating the world! Like that!

236
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:23,617
We ready! We ready ready ready!

237
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:30,617
Selain dari dukungan fans in this opportunity...
Aside from the fans' support in this opportunity...

238
00:18:30,617 --> 00:18:35,617
...kita juga mau mengucapkan terima kasih untuk semua sponsor yang mendukung...
...we also want to say thank you to all the sponsors who supported...

239
00:18:35,617 --> 00:18:37,617
...terjadinya konser ini!
...the realization of this concert!

240
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,617
Terima kasih!
Thank you!

241
00:18:44,617 --> 00:18:48,617
Eh, tapi ngomong-ngomong di konser ini kayaknya ada yang beda enggak sih?
Eh, but speaking of this concert, don't you think something is different?

242
00:18:58,617 --> 00:19:01,617
Yang beda tuh kali ini model kita.
The difference is our models this time.

243
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:03,617
Model baru nih.
It's a new model.

244
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:05,617
Gemes banget!
So adorable!

245
00:19:15,617 --> 00:19:17,617
Kameranya deketin ke aku.
Bring the camera closer to me.

246
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:21,617
Keimutan Kobo nih, nih, nih.
Kobo's cuteness, here, here, here.

247
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:31,617
Eh sini sini sini, ini kamera diambil Kobo semua enggak sih?
Eh here here here, Kobo is taking all the camera time, isn't she?

248
00:19:32,617 --> 00:19:34,617
Aku juga! Aku juga! Jangan Kobo doang!
Me too! Me too! Not just Kobo!

249
00:19:38,617 --> 00:19:41,617
Stop, stop, stop, stop! Mulai, mulai, mulai!
Stop, stop, stop, stop! Start, start, start!

250
00:19:55,617 --> 00:19:58,617
Jangan berebutan di depan konser!
Don't fight in front of the concert!

251
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,298
Hmph, syukurin loh ya.
Hmph, serves you right.

252
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,598
Itu main adu desibel penonton.
That was an audience decibel battle.

253
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:20,098
Kobo pengen deh coba kita teriakin penonton, karena kan tadi mereka sudah teriakin kita.
I want us to try shouting at the audience, since they shouted at us earlier.

254
00:20:20,098 --> 00:20:21,598
Iya, iya, iya.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
00:20:21,598 --> 00:20:24,798
Maksudnya kita teriakin intro kita bareng penonton-tachi!
I mean we shout our intro together with the audience!

256
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:26,298
Betul!
Correct!

257
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:28,798
Teriaknya bareng penonton, jangan teriakin penontonnya.
Shout *with* the audience, don't shout *at* the audience.

258
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:30,298
Iya gitu maksudnya.
Yeah, that's what I meant.

259
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:33,298
Soalnya kan habis ini kita harus nyanyi...
Because after this we have to sing...

260
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,998
...jadi kita harus simpen suara dulu gak sih?
...so we should save our voices first, right?

261
00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:37,298
Betul, ya.
That's right.

262
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:42,298
Gak bakal selama itu ternya... tenang aja, gak bakal selama durasi stream Kaela gitu ya guys ya.
It won't be that long... relax, it won't be as long as Kaela's stream duration, guys.

263
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:44,298
Ya udahlah, mau teriak-teriak ya udah...
Whatever, if you want to shout then fine...

264
00:20:44,298 --> 00:20:46,798
...aku gak masalah lah, aku ngikut, aku ngikut.
...I don't have a problem with it, I'm in, I'm in.

265
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:48,798
Gimana nih semuanya? Udah siap belum?
How is it everyone? Are you ready yet?

266
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:50,798
Siap Kak!
Ready Sis!

267
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:54,298
Siap nih kayaknya. Oke?
They seem ready. Okay?

268
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:55,798
Kobo dulu ya.
Kobo first, okay.

269
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:58,798
Aku mau kita sama-sama teriak...
I want us to shout together...

270
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,298
BO-KO-BO-KO-BO!

271
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:04,298
Oke? Siap ya?
Okay? Ready?

272
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,298
Satu, dua, tiga!
One, two, three!

273
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:11,298
BO-KO-BO-KO-BO!

274
00:21:14,298 --> 00:21:15,798
Suka suka!
Like it, like it!

275
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:17,598
Giliran Zeta, giliran Zeta.
Zeta's turn, Zeta's turn.

276
00:21:17,598 --> 00:21:19,298
Aku aku? Oke oke oke oke.
Me, me? Okay okay okay okay.

277
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:22,598
Pas aku bilang "Mission Starto", kalian bareng-bareng teriak...
When I say "Mission Starto", you all shout together...

278
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:24,298
..."Starto" ya!
..."Starto", okay!

279
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:28,298
Siap? A-a-a... Mission...
Ready? A-a-a... Mission...

280
00:21:28,298 --> 00:21:29,798
STARTO!

281
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:35,798
Oke, habis ini Kaela.
Okay, after this Kaela.

282
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:37,298
Oke oke oke oke.
Okay okay okay okay.

283
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:40,798
Nah ini ya, buat semua penonton sama HoloHero juga...
Alright, for all the audience and HoloHeroes too...

284
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:43,998
...kalau misalnya aku bilang "HoloHero!", kalian bilang "Hu Ha!"
...if I say "HoloHero!", you say "Hu Ha!"

285
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:46,298
Gampang kan? Langsung langsung langsung.
Easy right? Let's do it, let's do it.

286
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:48,798
Oke ya, siap ya?
Okay, ready?

287
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:50,798
HoloHero!

288
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:52,798
HU HA!

289
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:56,298
Mantap mantap mantap mantap.
Great, great, great, great.

290
00:21:58,298 --> 00:21:59,798
Keren keren keren.
Cool cool cool.

291
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:02,298
Akhirnya Gen 3 kompak juga.
Finally Gen 3 is in sync too.

292
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:03,798
Kompak lah!
Of course we're in sync!

293
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:05,798
Iya kompak.
Yeah, in sync.

294
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:08,298
Kelihatannya masih pada semangat nih ya.
Seems like everyone is still energetic.

295
00:22:08,298 --> 00:22:11,598
Soalnya dari lagu pertama kita hari ini aja udah kerasa banget.
Because even from our first song today, it felt really intense.

296
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:16,298
Kalian tuh pada nyangka gak sih kalau lagu pertama kita tuh bakal "100%"?
Did you guys expect that our first song would be "100%"?

297
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:18,998
Beuh, mana ada yang nyangka. Aku aja sendiri gak nyangka juga.
Beuh, no one expected it. Even I didn't expect it myself.

298
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:22,798
Langsung dibuka dengan Hoshino... famoed gitu.
Opened straight away with a Hoshino... Hoshinova mood.

299
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:24,298
Keren banget kan?
Really cool, right?

300
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:25,798
Asik, asik.
Cool, cool.

301
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:29,798
Keren banget sih. Apalagi tadi Zeta sama... Zeta sama nyanyi...
Really cool. Especially earlier Zeta and... Zeta and singing...

302
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:33,798
Zeta sama Kaela nyanyi "100%" tuh udah kayak real 100% ya.
Zeta and Kaela singing "100%" was like a real 100% performance.

303
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:35,798
Itu tuh bisa gak sih gak sekeren tadi?
Can you guys not be that cool?

304
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:39,798
Aku tuh jadi ingin kayak "ugh! ugh!" gitu kan.
I just wanted to go "ugh! ugh!" like that.

305
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:43,998
Kalian pernah gak sih nyanyi lagu sekeren tadi? Aura farming ya.
Have you guys ever sung a song as cool as that? True Aura farming.

306
00:22:43,998 --> 00:22:46,298
Aura farming sesungguhnya.
The true aura farming.

307
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,298
Keren banget emang lagunya Moona.
Moona's song is indeed really cool.

308
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:51,798
Emang kan Zeta kan soalnya biasanya lagu-lagu yang stylish...
Right, because Zeta usually does stylish songs...

309
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:53,598
...yang jazzy-jazzy gitu.
...jazzy ones like that.

310
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:57,298
Jadi tadi pas dinyanyiin tuh ya, "100%", rasanya jadi beda banget vibesnya.
So when it was sung earlier, "100%", the vibes felt really different.

311
00:22:57,298 --> 00:22:58,798
Terus Kaela juga...
Then Kaela also...

312
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:01,298
...tadi ngerap ya, "sttt sttt sttt"...
...rapped earlier, "sttt sttt sttt"...

313
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:03,298
...kayak... apa tuh?
...like... what was that?

314
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,798
Tatatata... tatatata...

315
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:08,298
Iya pokoknya keren banget!
Yeah, anyway it was really cool!

316
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:10,798
Keren banget ya tadi.
It was really cool earlier.

317
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:12,298
Tapi habis ini tuh masih ada lagi.
But after this there's still more.

318
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:14,298
New Zombie!

319
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:18,298
Ayo, pada tahu dong ini lagu siapa?
Come on, you surely know whose song this is?

320
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:20,298
Tau lah, tau lah.
Know it, know it.

321
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,298
Senpai kita, senpai kita.
Our senpai, our senpai.

322
00:23:22,298 --> 00:23:23,798
Iya tadi...
Yeah earlier...

323
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:27,798
Tadi tuh itu ya, HoloRo tuh performnya juga keren banget, kayak lagi di game gitu.
Earlier HoloRo's performance was also really cool, like being in a game.

324
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:29,298
Betul, setuju.
Correct, agreed.

325
00:23:29,298 --> 00:23:31,298
Terus tadi ada back dancernya men.
And there were back dancers, man.

326
00:23:31,298 --> 00:23:32,798
Keren gak guys? Keren gak?
Cool right guys? Cool right?

327
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:34,798
Keren!
Cool!

328
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:37,798
Ada apa lagi tuh tadi? Lampu laser...
What else was there earlier? Laser lights...

329
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:40,298
...terus ada efek kembang api segala.
...and there were firework effects and everything.

330
00:23:40,298 --> 00:23:42,298
Terus, banyaklah ya gimik-gimik yang wow.
Plus, there were lots of gimmicks that were wow.

331
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:45,798
Itu back dancer nanti aku hire semua ya buat solo konser aku.
I'll hire all those back dancers later for my solo concert.

332
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:48,298
Wah, udah ngomong konser solo aja.
Wow, already talking about a solo concert.

333
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:49,298
Omongan adalah doa ya.
Words are prayers, yeah.

334
00:23:49,298 --> 00:23:50,798
Iya, amin.
Yes, amen.

335
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:53,298
Tapi konser yang ini belum selesai.
But this concert isn't over yet.

336
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,798
Belum, belum, belum.
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

337
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,798
Eh, tapi kalian tahu gak sih sebelum ini tuh nyanyinya lagu apa?
Eh, but do you guys know what song was sung before this?

338
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:01,298
Eits, aku mah tahu banget lah.
Eits, I definitely know that.

339
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:02,798
Itu lagu terbaru aku.
That's my newest song.

340
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:03,998
Dahlah.
Whatever [Dahlah].

341
00:24:03,998 --> 00:24:05,798
Iya.
Yeah.

342
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:07,298
Udahlah.
Whatever.

343
00:24:07,298 --> 00:24:08,798
Gak usah dibahas.
Don't need to discuss it.

344
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:10,298
Dahlah.
Whatever.

345
00:24:10,298 --> 00:24:13,298
Loh, kok gitu? Itu tuh maksudnya judulnya "Dahlah".
Wait, why like that? The title really is "Dahlah".

346
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:15,298
Lagunya judulnya "Dahlah".
The song's title is "Dahlah".

347
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:17,298
Oh... "Dahlah".

348
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:19,798
Iya iya iya, oh "Dahlah".
Yeah yeah yeah, oh "Dahlah".

349
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:21,798
Bilang dong.
You should've said so.

350
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:25,298
Abisnya kamu kan sering "dahlah, dahlah" gitu.
Because you often say "dahlah, dahlah" like that.

351
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:28,298
Jadi kirain emang beneran "dahlah".
So I thought it was really just "dahlah" [giving up].

352
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:31,298
Entar "Dahlah, dahlah", pulang dia.
If you say "Dahlah, dahlah", she'll go home.

353
00:24:31,298 --> 00:24:33,298
Pulang nanti. Jangan, jangan.
Going home later. Don't, don't.

354
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:35,798
Kalau gitu "Dahlah" tuh maksudnya apa sih?
In that case, what does "Dahlah" mean?

355
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:38,298
"Dahlah" sama kehidupan.
"Dahlah" [Done] with life.

356
00:24:38,298 --> 00:24:40,798
Hidup tuh berat ya guys ya.
Life is heavy, guys.

357
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,298
Kalau hidup berat, ya udah, "dahlah" aja.
If life is heavy, well, just say "dahlah".

358
00:24:44,298 --> 00:24:46,298
Habis itu lanjutkan hidupmu.
After that continue your life.

359
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:47,298
Begitu.
That's it.

360
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:48,298
Iya betul, teman-teman.
Yes that's right, friends.

361
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:50,798
Di kehidupan yang dewasa ini...
In this adult life...

362
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:06,873
Jadi kita sambil keliling-liling kan nyapa fans gitu ya.
So we walked around while greeting the fans, right?

363
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:09,373
Asik banget ya tadi ya?
It was really fun earlier, right?

364
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:12,673
Aku juga suka banget tadi ada sebagian reff-nya ya.
I also really liked that there was part of the refrain earlier.

365
00:25:12,873 --> 00:25:16,873
Da la da la da la da la...

366
00:25:16,873 --> 00:25:19,373
Itu... Itu beda lagu gak sih?
That... isn't that a different song?

367
00:25:19,373 --> 00:25:21,373
Ih gak gitu deh. Gak gitu kek.
Eh, not like that. Not like that, man.

368
00:25:21,373 --> 00:25:26,873
Ya tapi pokoknya asik lah ya kalau nyanyi lagu chill santai-santai kayak gini.
Yeah but anyway it's fun to sing a chill song, relaxing like this.

369
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:29,873
Iya santai dong.
Yeah, relax of course.

370
00:25:29,873 --> 00:25:35,873
Tapi... ngomongin soal santai, kita tuh sebenernya belum bisa santai dulu. Heh, santai!
But... speaking of relaxing, we actually can't relax yet. Hey, relax!

371
00:25:35,873 --> 00:25:38,873
Hehe, karena... kayaknya katanya gak boleh santai terus.
Hehe, because... it seems they said we can't keep relaxing.

372
00:25:38,873 --> 00:25:41,373
Iya iya iya jangan santai-santai. Jangan terlalu santai.
Yeah yeah yeah don't relax. Don't be too relaxed.

373
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:45,873
Karena konsernya tuh masih panjang.
Because the concert is still long.

374
00:25:46,873 --> 00:25:52,873
Jadi, sebelum itu, kalian ada gak yang mau kalian sampein dulu? Mulai dari ini nih yang gak bisa diem.
So, before that, is there anything you want to convey first? Starting from this one who can't stay still.

375
00:25:56,873 --> 00:25:58,873
Tiga kata saja.
Just three words.

376
00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:00,873
I love you.

377
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:01,873
Keren.
Cool.

378
00:26:01,873 --> 00:26:03,373
The best.

379
00:26:03,873 --> 00:26:05,873
Sangat jelas ya.
Very clear, yes.

380
00:26:06,373 --> 00:26:09,873
Tetap semangat. Tetap semangat menjalani hidup ya.
Stay spirited. Stay spirited in living life, okay.

381
00:26:09,873 --> 00:26:14,373
Udah gitu aja. Pokoknya sampai akhir masih panjang. Semangat!
That's all. Anyway until the end it's still long. Spirit!

382
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,373
Sarangheyo~
I love you~

383
00:26:16,873 --> 00:26:18,373
Gak mau yooo.
I don't want to yooo.

384
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:21,873
Oke kalau aku... Yah... Semangat selalu.
Okay if it's me... Well... Spirit always.

385
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:23,373
Semangat santai.
Relaxed spirit.

386
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:26,673
Hidup jangan terlalu dibawa serius.
Don't take life too seriously.

387
00:26:26,873 --> 00:26:28,373
Semangat santai ya?
Relaxed spirit huh?

388
00:26:28,373 --> 00:26:29,873
Semangat santai.
Relaxed spirit.

389
00:26:29,873 --> 00:26:31,873
Semangat santai.
Relaxed spirit.

390
00:26:33,873 --> 00:26:36,373
Oke kalau gitu kita lanjut gak? Kita...
Okay in that case shall we continue? We...

391
00:26:36,873 --> 00:26:38,873
Weits weits weits tunggu dulu.
Wait wait wait hold on.

392
00:26:38,873 --> 00:26:45,373
Sebelum selesai... selesai ini nih ya... kita teriak bareng-bareng penonton dulu gak sih?
Before finishing... finishing this part... shouldn't we shout together with the audience first?

393
00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:47,873
Iya dong. Ayo ayo ayo!
Yes of course. Come on come on!

394
00:26:49,873 --> 00:26:52,873
Oke oke. Jadi... kita teriak bareng ya. Dalam hitungan tiga.
Okay okay. So... let's shout together. In the count of three.

395
00:26:52,873 --> 00:26:57,373
Kita sama-sama teriak Chromatic Future. Oke ya?
We shout Chromatic Future together. Okay?

396
00:26:57,873 --> 00:27:00,873
Oke oke. Chromatic Future. Gitu kan ya?
Okay okay. Chromatic Future. Like that right?

397
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:05,373
Iya iya kayak gitu. Oke langsung ya. Sambil lihat sini sini sini. Sambil lihat.
Yeah yeah like that. Okay straight away. While looking here here here. While looking.

398
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:08,373
Aku ya aku... aku yang penonton ini nih.
Me, yes me... I'm the audience here.

399
00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:11,873
Iya iya. Aku... aku ini deh, yang tengah yang tengah. Halo!
Yeah yeah. I... I'll be this one, the one in the middle. Hello!

400
00:27:13,373 --> 00:27:16,373
Oke bareng-bareng ya. Satu, dua, tiga!
Okay together. One, two, three!

401
00:27:16,873 --> 00:27:22,873
Chromatic Future!

402
00:28:00,873 --> 00:28:03,373
Everything was easy, I did it all alone.

403
00:28:03,373 --> 00:28:06,873
So effortlessly, I spread my wings and let my magic unfold.

404
00:28:06,873 --> 00:28:10,873
Got all problems solved without any setbacks there is nothing uncontrolled.

405
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:17,873
But there's no way I can begin, dream life that I need to win.

406
00:28:17,873 --> 00:28:20,873
I need to feel how all these things crumble into little pieces.

407
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:24,373
I know I gotta soar a little higher.

408
00:28:24,873 --> 00:28:27,873
Hope all turns to be the things I desire.

409
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,373
Layaknya burung merak yang bersayap.
Like a winged peacock.

410
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:33,873
Kan ku taklukan gelap.
I will conquer the darkness.

411
00:28:34,373 --> 00:28:36,873
Dengan sihir angin kan ku ajak.
With wind magic I will invite.

412
00:28:36,873 --> 00:28:40,373
Semua yang terlelap tuk bangkit melawan dunia.
Everyone asleep to rise and fight the world.

413
00:28:40,873 --> 00:28:42,873
We'll never give up.

414
00:28:42,873 --> 00:28:45,673
As long as we got the strength in ourselves.

415
00:28:45,873 --> 00:28:48,873
We could rise above the pain.

416
00:28:48,873 --> 00:28:52,373
Walking step by step, trusting my own pace.

417
00:28:52,873 --> 00:28:55,373
Giving me what I deserve to have.

418
00:28:55,373 --> 00:28:57,373
Let it go! (Just believe me!)

419
00:28:57,873 --> 00:28:59,373
They'll never bring me down, just believe me.

420
00:28:59,873 --> 00:29:01,373
Let it go! (Just believe me!)

421
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,373
It'll never bring us down, just believe me.

422
00:29:03,673 --> 00:29:06,373
Let it go! Won't let their cruelty stealin' my royalty.

423
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:10,373
And when the universe works against me I will just... Let it go!

424
00:29:10,873 --> 00:29:13,373
If it's spicy, just sip some tea, let it go.

425
00:29:13,873 --> 00:29:16,373
If it's spicy, just sip some tea, let it go.

426
00:29:16,873 --> 00:29:19,373
If it's spicy, just sip some tea, let it go.

427
00:29:19,873 --> 00:29:22,873
Let it go!

428
00:29:23,873 --> 00:29:25,873
I've been living carefree.

429
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:28,873
There's no bitter words in the world that could affect me.

430
00:29:29,873 --> 00:29:32,373
I spread my wings and let my magic unfold.

431
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:34,873
Not letting it show.

432
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,873
Stings but I'm bigger than my feelings so that will be enough.

433
00:29:38,373 --> 00:29:41,373
There is no way I can begin, dream life that I need to win.

434
00:29:41,873 --> 00:29:44,373
I need to feel how all these things crumble into little pieces.

435
00:29:44,873 --> 00:29:47,873
I know I gotta be better than ever.

436
00:29:48,373 --> 00:29:51,373
Hope all turns to be sweeter than ever.

437
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,373
Layaknya burung merak yang bersayap.
Like a winged peacock.

438
00:29:55,873 --> 00:29:57,873
Kan ku taklukan gelap.
I will conquer the darkness.

439
00:29:57,873 --> 00:29:59,873
Dengan sihir angin kan ku ajak.
With wind magic I will invite.

440
00:30:04,221 --> 00:30:05,221
We'll never give up!

441
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:08,421
As long as we got the strength in ourselves,

442
00:30:08,421 --> 00:30:11,021
We could rise above the pain.

443
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:12,721
We're stronger than before.

444
00:30:12,721 --> 00:30:14,621
Walking step by step,

445
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:16,121
trusting by our faith.

446
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:18,521
Giving me what I deserve to have.

447
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:19,321
Let's go!

448
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:20,121
