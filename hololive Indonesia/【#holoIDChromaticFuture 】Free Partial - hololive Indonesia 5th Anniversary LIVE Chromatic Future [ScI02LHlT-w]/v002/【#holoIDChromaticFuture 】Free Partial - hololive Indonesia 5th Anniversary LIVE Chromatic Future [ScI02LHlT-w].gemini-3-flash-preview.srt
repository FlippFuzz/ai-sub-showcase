Kalau capek enaknya gimana nih, HoloHero?
If you're tired, what's a good way to relax, HoloHero?

149
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:54,108
Dalas saja!
Just deal with it!

150
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:55,108
Cakep!
Great!

151
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:58,608
Bukannya sudah biasa
Isn't it already usual

152
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:01,908
Ditikam oleh kecewa
to be stabbed by disappointment?

153
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:03,108
(Aduh!)
(Ouch!)

154
00:10:03,096 --> 00:10:09,196
...saat dunia tak berjalan semestinya. Oh oh.
...when the world doesn't go as it should. Oh oh.

155
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:17,046
Mungkin sudahlah saatnya kau coba lepaskan saja.
Maybe it's time you just try to let go.

156
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:22,146
Tak perlu tanya mengapa lagi.
No need to ask why anymore.

157
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:30,116
Jika memang jawaban tak kau dapatkan.
If indeed you don't get the answer.

158
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:36,696
Jangan tangisi cobalah lalui teka-tekinya.
Don't cry, try to get through its puzzle.

159
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:43,046
Relakanlah karena pada akhirnya...
Let it go because in the end...

Kau lebih kuat daripada yang kau kira.
You are stronger than you think.

161
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:52,846
Dah lah saja. Oh dah lah saja.
Just let it be. Oh just let it be.

162
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:56,016

165
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:09,816
Mau gimana lagi. Walau kadang mati rasa.
What can you do. Even though sometimes you feel numb.

166
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:13,516
Bahkan hingga tak berdaya.
Even to the point of being helpless.

167
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:19,546
Dan usahamu terasa sia-sia.
And your efforts feel in vain.

168
00:11:19,696 --> 00:11:26,196
Jika memang jawaban tak kau dapatkan.
If indeed you don't get the answer.

169
00:11:26,696 --> 00:11:32,996
Jangan tangisi cobalah lalui teka-tekinya.
Don't cry, try to get through its puzzle.

170
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:39,696
Relakanlah karena pada akhirnya...
Let it go because in the end...

171
00:11:40,206 --> 00:11:45,696
Kau lebih kuat daripada yang kau kira.
You are stronger than you think.

172
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:52,196
Lepas semua kendali.
Release all control.

173
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:55,696
Tancap gas dan berlari.
Step on the gas and run.

174
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:58,696
Terima dan sudahi.
Accept and end it.

175
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:05,196
Jika memang jawaban tak kau dapatkan.
If indeed you don't get the answer.

00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:12,696
Jangan tangisi cobalah lalui teka-tekinya.
Don't cry, try to get through its puzzle.

177

00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:26,216
Kau lebih kuat daripada yang kau kira.
You are stronger than you think.

179
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:32,696
Kau lebih kuat daripada yang kau kira.
You are stronger than you think.

250
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:17,117
kita bakal konser lho di Indonesia,
that we would have a concert in Indonesia,

251
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:20,117

256
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:36,617
Aku juga waktu itu nggak nyangka banget kayak 'hah, beneran?'
I also really didn't expect it, like 'huh, really?'

257
00:17:36,617 --> 00:17:39,117
'Ini real nih?' gitu kan? Kayak 'loh, bisa gitu akhirnya?'
'Is this real?' right? Like 'how could this happen?'

258
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:43,617
Mana udah bersembilan di Indonesia pula ya kan?
And with all nine of us in Indonesia too, right?

259

00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:50,617
Ini kan konser pertama Hololive Indonesia yang bersembilan.
This is the first Hololive Indonesia concert with nine members.

261
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:55,117
Sebenarnya tuh nggak hanya ini tuh momen terbesar
Actually, this is not just the biggest moment

262
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:59,117
dan terpenting juga untuk fans Hololive Indonesia,
and most important for Hololive Indonesia fans,

263
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:03,617

But of course, this achievement won't just stop here.

266
00:18:15,117 --> 00:18:19,117
Jadi selanjutnya mungkin kita bisa apa ya...
So next, maybe we can...

275
00:18:47,617 --> 00:18:51,117
Hmm, Ela kamu sadar nggak?
Hmm, Ela, do you notice?

276

Wait, iya sadarlah.
Wait, of course I notice.

278
00:18:56,617 --> 00:18:59,617
Kalau Kobo mah nggak bakal sadar.
Kobo wouldn't notice.

00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:07,098
えっ、やだで。
Eee, okay then...

293
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:08,798
Kalau... nggak boleh...
If... you can't...

294
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:10,898
...rebutan Kobo sama Zeta...
...fight over Kobo and Zeta...

295
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:13,198
...hmmm, ya udah deh kita main aja deh sama penonton.
...hmmm, okay then, let's just play with the audience.

296
00:20:13,198 --> 00:20:15,798
Kobo pengen deh coba kita teriakin penonton,
Kobo wants to try shouting at the audience,

297
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,198
karena kan tadi mereka udah teriakin kita.
because they were shouting at us earlier.

298
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:21,298
Iya iya iya... maksudnya kita teriakin ini... bareng penonton-tachi.
Yeah, yeah, yeah... I mean, we'll shout this... together with the audience-tachi.

299
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:24,098
Betul! Teriakin bareng penonton, jangan teriakin penontonnya.
Correct! Shout together with the audience, don't shout at them.

300
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,298
Iya gitu maksudnya.
Yeah, that's what I meant.

301
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:28,798
Soalnya kan habis ini kita harus nyanyi,
Because after this we have to sing,

302
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,298
jadi kita harus simpen suara dulu nggak sih?
so we should save our voices first, right?

303
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:35,298
Betul ya. Gak bakal lama itu ternyata...
Right. It won't be that long...

304
00:20:35,298 --> 00:20:40,298
Tenang aja nggak bakal selama durasi stream Kaela ya guys ya.
Don't worry, it won't be as long as Kaela's stream duration, guys.

305
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:44,298
Eee, ya udahlah... mau teriak-teriak? Ya udah aku nggak masalah deh, aku ikut.
Eee, alright then... want to shout? I don't mind, I'll join.

306
00:20:44,298 --> 00:20:47,298
Gimana nih semuanya? Udah siap belum?
How about it, everyone? Are you ready?

307
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,598
Siap nih kayaknya. Oke, Kobo dulu ya.
Seems like they're ready. Okay, Kobo first.

308
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:55,798
Aku mau kita sama-sama teriak 'Baka baka baka!'
I want us to shout 'Baka baka baka!' together.

309
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:57,798
Oke, siap ya!
Okay, ready?

310
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,298
Satu, dua, tiga...
One, two, three...

311
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:08,798
BAKA BAKA BAKA!

312
00:21:15,098 --> 00:21:18,798
Suka suka! Giliran Zeta, giliran Zeta.
Suka suka! Zeta's turn, Zeta's turn.

313
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:20,298
Oke oke oke.
Okay, okay, okay.

314
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:26,298
Pas aku bilang 'Mission Stasto', kalian bareng-bareng teriak 'Stasto' ya.
When I say 'Mission Stasto', you all shout 'Stasto' together.

315
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:28,298
Siap?
Ready?

316
00:21:28,298 --> 00:21:31,298
A-A-A... Mission...

317
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:36,798
STASTO!

318
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,298
Oke, habis ini Kaela.
Okay, next is Kaela.

319
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:45,798
Oke oke oke... nah apa ya... buat semua penonton sama HoloHeroes juga...
Okay, okay, okay... well... for all the audience and HoloHeroes too...

320
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:51,798
Kalau misalnya aku bilang 'HoloHeroes', kalian bilang 'Hoo-Hah!' Gampang kan?
If I say 'HoloHeroes', you say 'Hoo-Hah!' Simple, right?

321
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:55,298
Langsung langsung langsung... oke ya? Siap ya?
Straight away... okay? Ready?

322
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:57,798
HoloHeroes!

323
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:02,798
HOO-HAH!

324
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,298
Mantap mantap mantap!

325
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:09,798
Keren keren keren. Akhirnya Gen 3 kompak juga.
Cool, cool, cool. Finally, Gen 3 is in sync too.

326
00:22:09,798 --> 00:22:14,298
Iya, kompak kelihatannya. Masih pada semangat nih ya.
Yeah, looks in sync. Everyone's still spirited, right?

327
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:18,298
Soalnya dari lagu pertama kita hari ini aja udah kerasa banget.
Because it was already very apparent from our first song today.

328
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:23,298
Kalian tuh pada nyangka nggak sih kalau lagu pertama kita tuh bakal '100%'?
Did you guys expect our first song would be '100%'?

329
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:27,298
Beh, mana ada yang nyangka. Aku aja sendiri nggak nyangka juga.
Psh, who would've thought. Even I didn't expect it.

330
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:32,298
Langsung dibuka dengan 'Hoshinova Mode' gitu. Keren banget kan?
Starting right off with 'Hoshinova Mode' like that. So cool, right?

331
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:37,798
Kece banget sih... apalagi tadi Zeta sama Kaela nyanyi '100%'
It was so cool... especially when Zeta and Kaela sang '100%'

332
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:40,298
...tuh udah kayak real 100% ya.
...it was like real 100%.

333
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:43,298
Itu tuh bisa nggak sih... nggak sekeren tadi?
Is it even possible... to not be as cool as that?

334
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:47,798
Aku tuh jadi pengen kayak... 'ugh, ugh' gitu kan kalian?
I just wanted to go... 'ugh, ugh', you know?

335
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:52,798
Kalian pernah nggak sih nyanyi lagu sekeren tadi? Aura farming ya...
Have you guys ever sung a song as cool as that? Truly aura farming...

336
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:57,298
Aura farming sesungguhnya. Keren banget emang lagunya Moona.
The ultimate aura farming. Moona's song is indeed very cool.

337
00:22:57,298 --> 00:23:02,298
Emang kan Zeta kan soalnya biasanya lagu-lagu yang stylish, yang jazzy jazzy gitu...
Because Zeta usually sings stylish, jazzy songs...

338
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:07,298
Jadi tadi pas dinyanyiin tuh ya '100%' rasanya jadi beda banget vibes-nya.
So when she sang '100%', the vibes felt completely different.

339
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:12,798
Terus Kaela juga tadi ngerap ya... 'ta-da-da-da-da-da-da'... kayak apa tuh?
Then Kaela was rapping too... 'ta-da-da-da-da-da-da'... like what was that?

340
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:18,298
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da... iya pokoknya keren banget tadi.
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da... yeah, it was just so cool.

341
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:24,298
Keren banget ya tadi... tapi habis ini tuh masih ada lagi... 'New Zombie'.
It was so cool... but after this, there's even more... 'New Zombie'.

342
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:27,298
Ayo, pada tahu dong ini lagu siapa?
Come on, you guys know whose song this is, right?

343
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:30,298
Tahu lah, tahu lah... Senpai kita, Senpai kita.
Of course, of course... our Senpai's, our Senpai's.

344
00:23:30,298 --> 00:23:35,798
Tadi tuh itu ya... Holoro performance-nya juga keren banget, kayak lagi di game gitu.
Earlier... the Holoro performance was also so cool, like being in a game.

345
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:39,798
Betul! Setuju. Terus tadi ada backdancer-nya, men!
Correct! Agreed. And there were backdancers, man!

346
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:43,298
Keren ya guys, keren nggak?
Cool, right guys? Wasn't it cool?

347
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:44,798
Keren!
Cool!

348
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,298
Ada apa lagi tuh tadi? Lampu laser, terus ada efek kembang api segara...
What else was there? Laser lights, then firework effects and all...

349
00:23:49,298 --> 00:23:52,798
...terus banyak lah gimmick-gimmick yang wow.
...and many wow gimmicks.

350
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:58,298
Itu backdancer-nya nanti aku hire semua ya buat solo konser aku.
I'm going to hire all those backdancers for my solo concert later.

351
00:23:58,298 --> 00:24:00,798
Wah, udah ngomong konser solo aja.
Whoa, talking about a solo concert already.

352
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:03,298
Ini omongan adalah doa ya.
Words are prayers, you know.

353
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:08,298
Iya... tapi konser yang ini belum selesai... belum belum belum.
Yeah... but this concert isn't over yet... not yet, not yet.

354
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:14,298
Eh, tapi kalian tahu nggak sih sebelum ini tuh nyanyinya lagu apa?
Eh, but do you guys know what song was sung before this?

355
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:19,298
Eh, aku mah tahu banget lah. Itu lagu terbaru aku... Dalah.
Eh, I know very well. It's my newest song... Dalah.

356
00:24:19,298 --> 00:24:22,298
Iya, udah... nggak usah dibahas... dalah...
Yeah, fine... no need to discuss it... dalah...

357
00:24:22,298 --> 00:24:27,798
Loh kok gitu? Itu tuh maksudnya judulnya 'Dalah', lagunya judulnya 'Dalah'.
Hey, why like that? I meant the title is 'Dalah', the song title is 'Dalah'.

358
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:31,298
Oooo... iya iya iya... oalah...
Oooo... right, right, right... oalah...

359
00:24:31,298 --> 00:24:36,298
Dalah... bilang dong... abisnya kan kamu sering 'dalah, dalah' gitu...
'Dalah'... say so... because you often say 'dalah, dalah' like that...

360
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:39,798
Jadi dikirain emang beneran 'dalah'...
So I thought it was just the usual 'dalah'...

361
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:43,298
Entar 'dalah dalah' pulang dia... kasihan jangan dalah.
She might just say 'dalah dalah' and go home... poor thing, don't say 'dalah'.

362
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:46,298
Kalau gitu 'Dalah' tuh maksudnya apa sih?
Then what does 'Dalah' actually mean?

363
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:51,298
'Dalah' sama kehidupan... hidup tuh berat ya guys ya...
'Dalah' with life... life is hard, you know guys...

364
00:24:51,298 --> 00:24:56,798
Kalau hidup berat ya udah 'dalah' aja, abis itu lanjutkan hidupmu, begitu.
If life is hard, just say 'dalah', then continue with your life, like that.

365
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,798
Iya betul teman-teman... di kehidupan yang dewasa ini ya...
Yeah, that's right friends... in this adult life...

366
00:25:01,473 --> 00:25:04,773
Untung lagunya santai, easy listening,
Luckily the song was chill, easy listening,

367
00:25:04,773 --> 00:25:07,473
jadi kita sambil keliling-keliling kan, nyapa fans, gitu ya.
so we could walk around and greet the fans, right?

368
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,973
Asik banget ya tadi ya,
It was so fun,

369
00:25:09,973 --> 00:25:12,273
aku juga suka banget tadi di sebagian rap-nya ya.
I really liked the rap part earlier.

370
00:25:12,273 --> 00:25:14,073
Da la da la da la da la...

371
00:25:14,073 --> 00:25:15,873
Itu, itu beda lagu gak sih?
Wait, isn't that a different song?

372
00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:17,673
...da la da la da la da la.

373
00:25:17,673 --> 00:25:20,273
Enggak gitu, Bocil. Gak gitu, Bocil.
Not like that, kiddo. Not like that, kiddo.

374
00:25:21,473 --> 00:25:25,273
Ya, tapi pokoknya asik lah ya kalau nyanyi lagu yang chill, santai-santai kayak gini.
But anyway, it's fun to sing chill, relaxed songs like this.

375
00:25:27,373 --> 00:25:29,273
Iya, santai dong.
Yeah, chill for sure.

376
00:25:30,273 --> 00:25:33,273
Tapi ngomongin soal santai, kita tuh sebenarnya belum bisa santai dulu.
But speaking of chill, we actually can't chill just yet.

377
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:35,173
Heh, santai.
Hey, chill out.

378
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:38,173
Karena katanya gak boleh santai...
Because you said we can't chill...

379
00:25:38,473 --> 00:25:41,873
Iya, iya, jangan santai-santai. Jangan terlalu santai.
Yeah, yeah, don't chill. Don't be too relaxed.

380
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:45,673
Karena konser itu masih panjaaaaang.
Because the concert is still loooooooong.

381
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:53,273
Jadi sebelum itu, kalian ada nggak yang mau kalian sampaikan dulu? Mulai dari ini nih yang enggak bisa diem.
So before that, is there anything you'd like to say? Let's start with this one who can't stay still.

382
00:25:56,573 --> 00:25:59,173
Tiga kata saja...
Just three words...

383
00:25:59,273 --> 00:26:00,873
I love you.

384
00:26:01,373 --> 00:26:04,273
Keren, the best. Sangat jelas ya.
Cool, the best. Very clear.

385
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,373
Tetap semangat.
Keep up the spirit.

386
00:26:07,373 --> 00:26:10,273
Tetap semangat menjalani hidup ya.
Keep your spirit up in life.

387
00:26:10,273 --> 00:26:14,073
Udah gitu aja. Pokoknya sampai akhir masih panjang. Semangat!
That's it. Anyway, it's still a long way to the end. Fighting!

388
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:16,173
Saranghaeyo!
I love you!

389
00:26:16,273 --> 00:26:18,273
Gomawoyo!
Thank you!

390
00:26:19,073 --> 00:26:23,273
Oke, kalau aku, ya, semangat selalu.
Okay, for me, well, always keep up the spirit.

391
00:26:24,173 --> 00:26:25,673
Semangat santai.
Chill spirit.

392
00:26:25,973 --> 00:26:28,073
Hidup jangan terlalu dibawa serius.
Don't take life too seriously.

393
00:26:28,073 --> 00:26:31,873
Semangat santai!
Chill spirit!

394
00:26:33,473 --> 00:26:36,673
Oke kalau gitu kita lanjut ke... wait wait wait.
Okay then, let's move on to... wait wait wait.

395
00:26:37,273 --> 00:26:41,273
Tunggu dulu. Sebelum selesai-selesai ini nih ya,
Hold on. Before we wrap this up,

396
00:26:41,273 --> 00:26:45,173
kita teriak bareng-bareng penonton dulu nggak sih?
should we shout together with the audience?

397
00:26:45,373 --> 00:26:49,173
Iya dong! Ayo ayo ayo!
Of course! Let's go, let's go!

398
00:26:50,873 --> 00:26:53,873
Oke oke. Jadi kita teriak bareng ya.
Okay, okay. So let's shout together.

399
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:57,973
Dalam hitungan ketiga, kita sama-sama teriak 'Chromatic Future'. Oke ya?
On the count of three, we'll all shout 'Chromatic Future' together. Okay?

400
00:26:58,073 --> 00:27:00,473
Oke oke, 'Chromatic Future' gitu kan?
Okay okay, 'Chromatic Future' like that, right?

401
00:27:00,473 --> 00:27:02,173
Iya iya kayak gitu.
Yeah, like that.

402
00:27:02,973 --> 00:27:05,973
Oke langsung ya sambil lihat sini sini sini.
Okay, right away, while looking here, here, here.

403
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:08,273
Aku ya, aku penonton yang ini. Penonton sini nih.
Me, I'm for this audience. This audience right here.

404
00:27:09,173 --> 00:27:12,073
Aku ini deh yang tengah, yang tengah. Halo!
I'll take the middle one then. Hello!

405
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,173
Oke bareng-bareng ya.
Okay, together now.

406
00:27:15,273 --> 00:27:16,973
Satu, dua, tiga...
One, two, three...

407
00:27:17,073 --> 00:27:20,873
Chromatic Future!

408
00:28:00,173 --> 00:28:02,173
Everything was easy

409
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:04,373
I did it all alone

410
00:28:04,373 --> 00:28:06,573
So effortlessly

411
00:28:06,573 --> 00:28:09,373
I spread my wings and let my magic unfold

412
00:28:09,373 --> 00:28:11,773
Got all problems solved

413
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,073
Without any setbacks there is nothing uncontrolled

414
00:28:14,073 --> 00:28:16,373
There's no way I can begin

415
00:28:16,373 --> 00:28:18,673
Dream life that I need to win

416
00:28:18,673 --> 00:28:21,273
I need to feel how all these things crumble into little pieces

417
00:28:21,273 --> 00:28:23,473
I know I gotta soar a little higher

418
00:28:23,473 --> 00:28:25,773
Hope all turns to be the things I desire

419
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:32,573
Layaknya burung merak yang bersayap
Like a winged peacock

420
00:28:32,573 --> 00:28:35,173
Kan ku taklukkan gelap
I will conquer the darkness

421
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:37,473
Dengan sihir angin kan kuajak
With wind magic I'll invite

422
00:28:37,473 --> 00:28:39,973
Semua yang terlelap tuk bangkit
All those who sleep to rise

423
00:28:39,973 --> 00:28:42,073
Melawan dunia
Against the world

424
00:28:42,073 --> 00:28:43,873
We'll never give up

425
00:28:43,873 --> 00:28:46,173
As long as we got the strength in ourselves

426
00:28:46,173 --> 00:28:49,173
We could rise up above the pain

427
00:28:49,173 --> 00:28:51,473
We're stronger than that

428
00:28:51,473 --> 00:28:53,673
Walking step by step, trusting my pace

429
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:56,073
Giving me what I deserve to have

430
00:28:56,073 --> 00:28:57,073
Let's go

431
00:28:57,073 --> 00:28:58,273
Just believe me

432
00:28:58,273 --> 00:28:59,473
Let it go

433
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:01,673
It'll never bring me down just believe me

434
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:02,973
Let it go

435
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:05,173
It'll never bring us down just believe me

436
00:29:05,173 --> 00:29:07,473
Fate may bear cruelties still I'm a royalty

437
00:29:07,473 --> 00:29:11,673
And when the universe works against me I would just

438
00:29:11,673 --> 00:29:12,773
Let it go

439
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:15,073
If it's spicy just sip something let it go

440
00:29:15,073 --> 00:29:16,173
Let it go

441
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:18,473
If it's spicy just sip something let it go

442
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:19,573
Let it go

443
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:22,873
If it's spicy just sip something let it go

444
00:29:22,873 --> 00:29:25,873
Let it go

445
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,073
I've been living carefree

446
00:29:28,073 --> 00:29:31,373
There's no bitter words in the world that could affect me

447
00:29:31,373 --> 00:29:33,673
I spread my wings and let my magic unfold

448
00:29:33,673 --> 00:29:35,973
Not letting it show

449
00:29:35,973 --> 00:29:40,373
Things but I'm bigger than my feelings so that will be enough

450
00:29:40,373 --> 00:29:42,673
There is no way I can begin

451
00:29:42,673 --> 00:29:44,973
Dream life that I need to win

452
00:29:44,973 --> 00:29:47,573
I need to feel how all these things crumble into little pieces

453
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:49,773
I know I gotta be better than ever

454
00:29:49,773 --> 00:29:52,073
Hope all turns to be sweeter than ever

455
00:29:52,073 --> 00:29:54,473
Layaknya burung merak yang bersayap
Like a winged peacock

456
00:29:54,473 --> 00:29:56,973
Kan ku taklukkan gelap
I will conquer the darkness

457
00:29:56,973 --> 00:29:59,373
Dengan sihir angin kan kuajak
With wind magic I'll invite

458
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:03,621
Semua yang terlelap tuk bangkit melawan dunia
All those who slumber to rise up and face the world

459
00:30:04,321 --> 00:30:05,221
We'll never give up!

460
00:30:05,421 --> 00:30:08,421
As long as we got the strength in ourselves

461
00:30:08,421 --> 00:30:10,521
We could rise above the fate

462
00:30:10,621 --> 00:30:11,921
We're stronger than them

463
00:30:12,121 --> 00:30:14,121
Walking step by step, trusting by our faith

464
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:17,621
Giving me what I deserve to have

465
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:18,921
Let's go!

466
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:22,621
Believe me, let it go, they'll never bring me down

467
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,421
Just believe me, let it go, it'll never bring us down

468
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:29,921
Just believe me, won't let their cruelty steal my royalty

469
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:33,321
And when the universe works against me, I will just...

470
00:30:33,421 --> 00:30:35,421
Let it go!

471
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:38,321
Let it go!

472
00:30:39,121 --> 00:30:41,321
One voice is not enough to do this!

473
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:44,421
One, two, three, let it go!
